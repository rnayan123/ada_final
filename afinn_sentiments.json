In my case, I started as an art student, became a fashion designer, who looked at that landscape and chose to be a small business owner, who then saw technology would rule this domain, educated myself in the ways of programming and database design to build my own on-line business, only to realize after 25 years of success that the inventory investment to grow at the rate necessary for success was more than I wanted to commit to, leading to going back to school to get a formal education in Data Science from UC Irvine, which has led to now starting my new career as and Energy Analyst at the California Energy Commission. My advice is to stay connected to today's reality and be open and agile enough to update your best choice for your best future, cause guys I guarantee you its going to change so you might as well enjoy the ride.

These won't be canon but it makes sense to let people take the IP and make their own fan pics and then pay a cut to the corporations that own it. There will be restrictions about how they can be used (i.e. no Star Wars porn parodies using AI to use the original cast) but it seems inevitable and makes business sense as the best stuff will make them money and everything else costs nothing. They can probably remake the best content and not even pay the original creators if they find something is working. Basically crowdsourcing blockbusters (I don't think that would be fair but that is very separate from whether I think it'll happen).",

I use chatgpt daily and it struggles on anything that doesn't have a lot info/written about it. Also chatgpt still struggles with vague questions or sentences where as a human would either understand the ask or likely ask for further clarification where as AI tries to be a chad and answer based off incomplete information/sentences creating a terrible customer service experience because then you either have to reask it or think its correct when its going in the wrong direction (no real fault of the AI but really just an issue with the user input).
