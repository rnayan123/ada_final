As time clicks forward, our current today is becoming exponentially different from your yesterday, making yesterday's choices diametrically different from our todays realities. In my case, I started as an art student, became a fashion designer, who looked at that landscape and chose to be a small business owner, who then saw technology would rule this domain, educated myself in the ways of programming and database design to build my own on-line business, only to realize after 25 years of success that the inventory investment to grow at the rate necessary for success was more than I wanted to commit to, leading to going back to school to get a formal education in Data Science from UC Irvine, which has led to now starting my new career as and Energy Analyst at the California Energy Commission. My advice is to stay connected to today's reality and be open and agile enough to update your best choice for your best future, cause guys I guarantee you its going to change so you might as well enjoy the ride.

There may be other ways leadership is looking to integrate AI. I just started at a local Intel/Dell AI Workforce program and hope to branch into AI.

I've found your videos on these topics incredibly insightful. I've been using ChatGPT to start doing some fun side data science projects and learn more about Machine Learning (took a course in it like ~4 years ago, so very rusty on the topics), and it has been incredibly helpful as a knowledgeable assistant. For someone with coding experience in Python but maybe not expert developer level, ChatGPT is so good at getting one started at learning how to use new packages and tools that are outside of one's current knowledge base. I know several friends who are also planning on leaving academia and trying to break into data analysis/data scientist roles, so I will be recommending them to your channel!",
