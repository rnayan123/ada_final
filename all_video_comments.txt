Hey dude should I have to have a master‚Äôs degree or a doctorate in order to work as a data scientist or not?
Hello sir... Hope you great, I'm from India in southern part, i saw your comment section your really good to reply at all, it was very nice.... Sir I'm passionate to start my career in data related fields because i love to uncovering the hidden information, so i start to prepare from myself, but in India the data science fields are to get a job is very difficult because they need much more expertise person, im from very middle class family, I can't affer lot of money for some course and certification, but I'm really passionate to work in data fields, now what i do sir, how to land my first job in this data field, in other hand the AI also destroy the employee, so give some suggestions, for my career and what can i study sir... 

Note : Sorry for my poor English üòÖ

Thankyou Sir
You‚Äôre a legend Ken! ‚ù§
Time to develop your skills in the bitcoin ecosystem!
can you please update the video that explains how to create data science portfolio with hugo ?
Thank you Ken for everything that you have done for me and the community! In my eyes, you were the first to start creating great Data Science content and gave many people their start both on YouTube and professionally!

I'd love to reconnect one of these days! I'm looking forward to your return to making content when the time comes!
I see this late, but glad you made a video about it Ken! Happy for you my friend. I wish you the best with the new podcast!
Excited to see this new content!
It‚Äôs very brave of you to follow your love for sport and make the change you want to make! You are one of the people who have inspired me to create content on YouTube. Thank you and I‚Äôm excited for Exponential Athlete episodes ü§ó. All the best for everything you‚Äôre planning to do! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good Luck üëç
The content that you have created as an educator/creator has immensely impacted not only those in the data domain but also the general audience as the new Exponential Athlete podcast is generally applicable that we can adapt not only for sports but also for studies and for work. Congrats Ken on your next endeavor, I'm rooting for you, my friend!
Thanks for all your help getting me started with Data Science back in 2020. It gave me the foundation to achieve some pretty cool experiences and feel confident in my skills üôèüèæ
Loved your honesty Ken..
You were one of the few creators who inspired me in my early stages and I wish you the very best in everything you do üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
Great video
Personal and career growth as a result of self reflection? Always respectable, Ken. Haven't listened to all of them but you're very clearly enjoying the hell out of the Exponential Athlete so why not? :D
Ken you videos , content and course helped me a lot in my data journey.
I learned so much from your channel when i was a fresher and your project series actually helped me land a job and right now i have 3 years of experience so really thankful for all content, time and effort you have given to data community through your channel.
All the very best for your future and we are always here for you!!!! 
Like it or not time does lay a path in front of us. What I mean by that is today we choose our best path based on our past and what we hope for our future. As time clicks forward, our current today is becoming exponentially different from your yesterday, making yesterday's choices diametrically different from our todays realities. In my case, I started as an art student, became a fashion designer, who looked at that landscape and chose to be a small business owner, who then saw technology would rule this domain, educated myself in the ways of programming and database design to build my own on-line business, only to realize after 25 years of success that the inventory investment to grow at the rate necessary for success was more than I wanted to commit to, leading to going back to school to get a formal education in Data Science from UC Irvine, which has led to now starting my new career as and Energy Analyst at the California Energy Commission. My advice is to stay connected to today's reality and be open and agile enough to update your best choice for your best future, cause guys I guarantee you its going to change so you might as well enjoy the ride. Bravo Ken for staying connected to your reality! I am looking forward to watching your next chapter.
Ken,
As one of the first OG Data Science Youtubers, you've had a tremendous impact not only on the community at large but also on my journey.

I remember first watching your content when struggling to learn everything in this field and then you made me feel like this was possible. I remember saying to myself: "Heck, if Ken can do this, so can I"üòú

Super stoked for your next journey with the Expontial Athlete; I can already see the passion in the episodes you've made so I have a feeling this is gonna be epic!

Thanks again for all your mentoring my dude. ü§ô-Luke
I got into the field heavily thanks to your content man. I always appreciate! You can't imagine how many lifes you have touched upon :)
Thanks a lot and also best of luck with the new projects!
Great to see that you're making changes based on some internal reflection and deciding what value you can provide to others. Looking forward to the new videos!  Sharing real experiences is great. Sports and performance are closely related to data science too - not for everyone but definitely worth checking out.
I hope you're still familiar with papaya.
I need tennis maths now pls!
Thanks so much for all your videos in the past, wish you luck in your next endeavors. Thanks to you and your videos I was able to transition to a DS role and it changed my life forever. Just know that your videos did impact people's lives, I'm a testament to that!
Good luck in your new venture!!
Ken, I admire your honesty and vulnerability. Very inspiring! I am sure this decision was not easy but I love that you are following your heart and passion. Cheers to the next chapter, I will be rooting for you üéâ
Can you do an analysis of a sport (i like soccer or basketball but any game will be enjoyable) from a game theory point of view?
Best of luck Ken. I'll definetely check your sport's podcast. In my life i dedicate much of time to sports as much as to data (that pays the bills). Would be great to have some content regardind sports analytics;
RIP ü•≤
Dude, that was SO heartfelt. Appreciate everything you've done for the community. 

I owe you a huge debt of gratitude for being a waymaker in the data career space and the content creation space. Cheers to the future.
Glad to hear you not getting sucked into the AI hype vortex. Everyone seems to be covering AI news, and it‚Äôs just very noisy content. 

AthleteX, on the other hand, looks like an original and promising use of time. (Been loving the Kobe commentary). I‚Äôll be watching!
Appreciate the honesty! Good luck on your new venture man!
Best of luck with this Ken
Best of luck in your new projects Ken!üéâ
Everything grows and I am looking forward to the new content
Appreciate the honesty, and can't wait to see the channel evolve and how exponential athelete plays out!
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ you done awesomely well thanks
Thanks for the candid video, I was worried you‚Äôd be leaving YouTube, but glad to know you‚Äôll still be around. You‚Äôre a huge inspiration to me and the reason I‚Äôm pushing forward with a masters degree in DS. You‚Äôve helped me start my first Kaggle competition and change how I viewed the field of data science. Excited to see what‚Äôs coming
Seeing the evolution of you and this channel over the years has been amazing. Best of luck to ya and always supporting from the sidelines!
Funny. No more than a week ago, I was driving and randomly thought, "I haven't seen Ken post a video in a while."

No idea if this is a good idea or not, but Billy Walters,  who is the greatest sports gambler of all time might have some insight into many analytics you're looking for as he assigns a point value to every athlete that matters in a sports outcome. He might have both tangible and intangible aspects that athletes possess that help them be a better athlete. If you could get him to open up as he has been willing to do recently as he looks to pass his legacy on, you might get some of what you are looking for. 

Will definitely follow that project as well!
Hey man, I think it‚Äôs amazing you‚Äôve made a change after some personal reflection! 

Even by doing that you‚Äôre giving us viewers inspiration to do a similar exercise for ourselves. Good luck with everything ahead üéâ
I'm looking forward to whatever happens next with this channel. All respect to you, man!
Have always enjoyed your stuff dude, even managed to land my first data engineer position a few weeks back! All the best with whatever you choose to do moving forward.
good luck Ken
Admirable honesty and humility. Much luck on your journey
Just parking out of love.
Thanks for watching everyone. I felt like it was the right thing to do to update all those have followed me this far with the new changes going on in my life. I'm extremely excited about my new direction even though it means I'll be taking some time off from this channel that I've been working on for the last 5 years. I wish you all the same sort of luck and encouragement following your own passions!
Thanks for watching! What is the answer to my secret question?

ANYONE THAT IS MARRIED SHOULD TAKE AN IQ TEST.NOW WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION NO IQ TEST OR DNA TEST IS NEEDED ONLY UNLESS THE FATHER IS CONCERNED WITH THE HAHAHA. ANY MAN THAT WOULD GO TO THE COURT OF LAW TO STOP AN ABORTION SHOULD BE CHECKED INTO A ONE WAY RETARD  SANCTUARY.
Down voted for blabbering and not getting to the point
Sorry for disturbance I has a question about From where to start to become data scientist For example which institute are good in india
you looked sma
rter before you started talking
Hi Ken, 

What do you think of studying a double major in data science and information technology?
Loved the analysis, very detailed on the things that chat GPT is good at doing; which shows how important we have to be mindful of the tasks we give to it and the answers it generates. Thank you for the videoüëç
Phew üòÖthat was a close one üòÇ
If you want to take legit online IQ test try danish and norwegian websites of mensa - scores from those tests have very strong correlation with official mensa tests. Also: there are no different types of intelligence. It's an interesting idea, but it has been debunked.
You've always been Ken Jeenius for us üåª Also btw that IQ ranking video was suggested to me right after the end of your video üòÇ
I'm glad tho it seems this type of tests has not been a huge part of the model training behind ChatGPT
Hi Ken. The secret question in Spanish is ¬øEres m√°s listo que ChatGPT? Thanks for the video!
If you want to actually learn about IQ I would recommend talking to a psychologist instead of researching consumer web-based IQ products.  When a psychologist tests for intelligence they use the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version 4. This test is administered in person, and ChatGPT couldn't do it because you need to have a physical body to take the test.  If we research the embodied nature of cognition (see Metaphors we Live By - Lakoff) we learn that human cognition separated from the body is impossible - which makes us wonder what we would be measuring with the intelligence of a bot
Interesting. I did a quite extensive IQ Test too and it scored 65, which was honestly quite underwhelming. I used GPT-4-Vision and German language and it did 0/10 tasks correct in the math category.
Is the lecture you gave at the event online anywhere? I‚Äôd be interested in listening
You're an inspiration my friend! Truly outstanding, and MAN am I #jealous....what a sweet opportunity!! Awesome!
Oooh, phenomenally put together video, Ken. Lots of good tidbits, and yes, awesome work by SAS.
So cool, Ken!!

That chip-in at the 9:08 üëÄüëÄ
I have some particular insight into SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software. My dad works as a business analyst contractor and have 20+ years of SAS experience. He pretty much now only accepts jobs that look for strong SAS proficiency because not many people have that. Thus, when he manages to land a contract, he tends to be very highly valued. On the other hand, such roles are harder and harder to come by because everyone now is switching over to Python.
I know I'm not alone in saying I'm glad you chose data science over your golfing career üòú
‚ÄúInnovation is not going anywhere! #wisdom Ken - gratitude sir!
Impress with that man, keep it up
I am impressed, and enrolling into 365 data science course.
Let‚Äôs go Ken!!
Thank you
Ken jee. Love you man.
Special thanks to SAS for making this experience possible!
How can one get started with contracting Kenny?
Is the contracting trend just in tech, or in all days science domains?
As a freelance Data Scientist, I confirm this is true!
Let's go , with how to get started !
I am a student how can I start a contract job sir
Make video on stable diffusion and Emad mustaque and its impact on data jobs?
Interested in the topic ‚ò∫Ô∏è!
Full-time jobs pay severance. Contracts can be ended on the spot and without the chance to switch to a new team.
Would love you to create a video on how best to switch from full time work to contract/ freelancing asap!
I got my first role in Data science about 6 months ago 

And  recently started looking at working on contracts, though I relaxed because I learnt it could be a bit challenging to start as it is a demanding environment, its usually straight to delivery....

I really enjoy my current company, the manager and the team, I'm learning a lot of new things (good for me) and I appreciate they took a chance on me to allow me start with my visa limitations. My pay is around what is obtainable in my region for a level 5 but its difficult meeting my needs as a family man so I sometimes have to do other menial jobs to patch it up. What do suggest I do, I recently bagged my Ph.D. which should come with its own benefits
Yes, please make a video on how to get started in contracting
Would love a video about contract work, especially from the POV of a FTE.
I've been recently fired after over 5 years. The only one reason was 'cost reduction', so I couldn't agree more with all arguments presented in a vid. Many thanks, Ken for your work.
Thanks for the video, Ken! Your insights are greatly appreciated. I'm excited to learn how to get started.
Would love another vdo on contracting...
Do it!!!!
Hey Ken, really loved the points, it would be super nice to have a video on how to land your first client. Please do ‚ù§
Who is the dude in the background not paying attention to this great content going on right in front of them!! ü§Ø

On a related note, I lowkey love this quote from Mr.Wonderful "Salary is the drug they give you to forget your dream"
Awesome video Ken, not enough data creators are talking about this!

Like you said the rise of contract work is in many ways a win-win for employees and employers. Employees can have more diversified and flexible income opportunities, while employers can optimize their staffing needs. 

Beyond all that, I feel the flexibility of contract work allows it to be more engaging and fulfilling for contractors.
Great video and insights Ken!
Absolutely would be waiting to see a video from you on contracting - going to share this with friends, and are you available for one on one mentoring (paid)?
we need a video on how to get started
I‚Äôm a contractor myself, agree 100% with all points in this video. Can confirm it‚Äôs true. I would appreciate another video about this on how to get started
This was a great video!

I am fortunate enough to work as a salaried employee for one of the largest vendors in my industry. No mass layoffs yet (although a hiring freeze), and top mgmt actually seem to care about us. With that said, I do want to explore the option of being a contractor/freelancer. So, please do make a Part 2 on the cons and maybe a Part 3 on how to get started and attract clients.
I think this video is really needed to spread awareness that other ways of work are possible. Thank you Ken, looking to see more from this topic from you
Hi Ken, it would be valuable for me to get your take on how to build an independent contractor client base. And thanks for this video. It was insightful.
How can I start as an contractor?
Love this topic. Thank you for making this helpful video.
I want to know how much experience I need to contract as a data scientist, certifications needed/ recommended, where to find clients, etc.
I think you made some great points about contracting but I do think context matters a lot

1) in the US since your healthcare is tied to employment you're screwed as a contractor with respect to that as well as taxes in a few ways

2) Contracting and having your income as business income is prudent but getting clients is easier said than done. In a competitive marketplace it will be difficult to differentiate. In your niche you are a super star but that is not the case for most folks I wager.

3) Cal Newport talks about digital nomads and how lonliness is a huge issue because one thing about "9-5" work and culture is that having time to do things with people and experiences is rooted in our cultural shared schedules. If that doesn't matter to you great but good luck finding people to hang out with on your wednesday off at 3pm otherwise.

That said I personally DO want to get into either starting a side business or contracting because its a huge blessing for the educational benefits you mention.

Great vid
Very informative! Looking forward to next video!
Ive been a data consultant for a year or so now with a couple of clients and the freedom is incredible. Currently though finding new work has been difficult.
Due to many factors, i have been considering the contractor route. This video puts a new light to the matter. Thanks! Also more on the contracting role would be great!
I would certainly be interested in more contractor related content.
Hi Ken Jee THANKS!
Not sure what is the situation in other countries, but in Slovakia, good luck to fire an employee unless the company is cancelling the position/role. Contractors have to do way more paper work here - taxes and contributions to health and social insurance (which are mandatory and as a employee you can ask your employer to do all of this for you while he cant refuse by the law). On the other hand you are more flexible and have some perks in taxes
Ahhh, see when I first saw the title I thought you were talking about contract jobs such as ones through temp agencies. Temp agency contract jobs are not what you want. They have all the negatives of being a contractor but no resiliency. These kind of contractors are the first to be let go, often are paid less, receive worse benefits through the temp agency, and still are tied down to just one place of employment for 40+ hours.
Hey ken i would love to see a video on how to get started with contracts!üòä
Even better when you live in a developed country with universal health coverage! Great video!
Ken jee is the best tech person I have ever seen in my life ,he is my inspiration‚ù§
first 

edit: i need a job

edit #2: i need to find more contracting work

Quite insightful been trying to get a DS in the Computer Vision niche been a struggle though.
I feel this a lot as I am currently transitioning from my customer service role (for the past 7 years) into data analytics. I've been job hunting since June and no luck so far. 92 job applications sent, 6 initial interviews, 1 interview with a hiring manager but no job offer so far. I've done projects  and tailor fitted my resume and cover letter to be relevant to the fields that i am applying to and did pro bono work to have a relevant work experience for my resume, and still nothing. While doing my projects, I've come to love analytics more and more despite the rejections so I am 100% certain about my career shift. However, burnout from the job rejections is slowly creeping in. To add insult to injury, I've seen entry/junior level positions that's asking for 5 years of experience in the field. I just hope to see something positive in my career in this field

Informative video as always Ken! You have been instrumental in my career shift and journey into data science and analytics. Papaya!
wow if that graph about the job market is true then that explains a lot about my situation. I graduated college in May so around March-May is when I started getting really desperate for a job and it felt completely hopeless. couldn‚Äôt even get anything but automated rejection emails. Spent the summer doing the ‚Äúupskill‚Äù portion of this video, waited tables while living with my parents and working on a portfolio and certifications. around August I started noticing more attention from recruiters, and I finally got a really good job offer in September! Hopefully things work out for me
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Lowkey kind of a depressing video
Also wanted to add that data engineer is more similar to backend software developing rather than scientific/gaining insights.
I actually have the stats for my entry level hit rate: 10 interviews/461 applications = 2% 
Senior level hit rate: 23 interviews/36 applications = 52% 

It gets easier (or maybe I was just lucky the second time around)
Goddamit I've been sticking this career path since graduation but hit a brick wall twice after 1.contract ended in Dec 2020 and 2. a major lay off Summer 2023. I guess it's my Waterloo in 2020 but come on it can't be twice?!
Thanks Ken this was a very honest update of the DS market
You can have multiple contracts if you have your own company. That means way more money.
Ken you are an honestly valuable content creator.
For data science projects, how much would you recommend creating to make one stand out the most? And what project topics do you recommend? I have no idea which topic I wanna choose rn. From your experience, how long did it take for you to create a beginner data project?
Very informative and factual as always. Thanks. I have a question, hope I could get some advice from you. I really like the processing, model building, date modeling and mathematical and coding side of data science but hate the reporting and communication side, which is also my weakness point. Which specialized role should I apply for and pursue?
"Treat the job search like a data science problem" ü§Ø

Also, I second this recommendation on social media (or just building things)... I'm now fortunate enough that I don't have to apply to jobs and companies typically reach out me.
Is there a big difference between logistics and data-related jobs (besides the job title)? I find right now there are huge opportunities in the logistics or supply chain field which all lack good data management and analytics practices. It was the only way I was able to get my foot in the door in the competitive market and use that opportunity to learn and develop.
There is also quantitative analysts! Don't forget those
Hi Ken. Could you please review my resume?
This video is indeed very helpful. I concluded many of the points made here on my own over time.

I also very much look forward to the video on contracting. There are entire courses dedicated to teaching data scientists/ML engineers on how to be freelancers. Although I'm happily employed where I am, I want to at least explore the option of being my own boss someday.
One of your most helpful videos so far! Straight to the point and real/honest advice. Lost my job two weeks ago. Was not in tech. Graduated with a math degree two years ago. I‚Äôve self studied data science related projects on the side but never did enough studying to get the role in tech. This helps motivate me to just get it done and study hard for the next few weeks. Made a better resume and staying on top of applications. Thanks for everything you put into your channel Ken! Really lifted me up today
- getting Azure cents helped my callback 
- gonna upskill / specialize into data engineering self learning 
- LinkedIn has next to 0 callbacks for me, but Indeed works extremely well
Thank You So Much for the advice.s It was really really needed.
I'm embarrassed to admit it but I never gave much thought of observing the statistics of job hunting or the specialization of data science jobs. Thanks for the eye opener.
Hi Ken! Thanks for this video. It's very helpful. I''d like to watch the contracting videos. I'm starting in data science with previous experience in business analysis, and I'd like to build something and be a contractor.
Hello Ken, great video. I would like to ask you some questions:
Do you think it's possible to create an extra layer of automation to outperform the job market?
I don't have a university degree, and I'm not aware of how much of a disadvantage that puts me at. Should I consider bootcamps?
Furthermore, I'm thinking of starting a DS YT channel, beginning with explaining the basics. Any suggestions before I start?
Thank you very much for your content.
Ken Jee, awesome video! Please, make that video about independent contracts over full time jobs at big companies. Also, talk about freelancer possibilities. Thank you very much!
I follow the strategy of networking more and applying to smaller set of positions. I much prefer informal networking to formal networking, I wish there was more of it.
In the first few minutes, your argument looks a lot like the suken cost falacy, but i know it's not
üîãüîåüíª
Thank you,  I couldn't wait to watch it but I will watch it again to really consider these advices.
If you stay at the end of the video, Data Science definitely is for you
Really nice advice Ken. This helps alot to change the strategy on such a dificult market. Thanks
01:53 That look literally sent me. HahahaüòÇ
is it related to usa market only?
Yay a new job posting! Oh wait, its already got 100+ applications üòÖ
Papaya
i have done a career transition but I'm worried about my friends who have been laid off that are still trying in data science :(
interesting
When I changed careers and got into data, I immediately knew it was a big mistake. It‚Äôs a big black box and no one understands it. Companies have probably been burned and don‚Äôt see a point in investing.
data science is a bubble due to the fucking media hype.
PAPAYA
put cybersecurity on the list
Hi ! Thanks for uploading this ! I will be soon in professional retraining to become a data analyst and I‚Äôve started watching videos like yours cause the way to be employed seems to be full of hardships. 
I live in France and data driven enterprises are not overwhelming the market yet so I truly hope finding jobs and being employed in future years.
Papaya
Papaya
FAANG is so overrated. Plenty of jobs out there if you aren't a leetcode tech bro needing validation from San Francisco
Should i switch to cybersecurity then. i just started getting into data science recently.
Good video. I‚Äôd compare it with the rest of the job market though
They may be rebounding but they have so many people applying that the market is over saturated. Hopefully, that changes as we go into the fall and into 2024. I‚Äôve been job searching since February and it‚Äôs been the worst job market I‚Äôve ever experienced.
Papaya
The tech gold rush is over. Anybody telling you otherwise is trying to sell you the shovels.

Only pursue a data science role if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre very interested in. There‚Äôs many other roles out there where you can make more money, so don‚Äôt try to gold rush this sector anymore.
Papaya
Papaya
I think that cs isn't gonna be a valid option from now on. It's been the most mainstream degree for the past 10 years. That happens with every industry. The IT industry was red hot from 1995 to 2000 and then went bust in 2001, Oil drilling was on fire from 2010 to 2014 and is now in dangerous territory. Noone tells students that the real world depends on the capital flow into and out of markets
üò≠how can a fresh graduate people to get into industry when such hard time üò¢
Yes, please to a video on the contract side of things. Contract roles have been the bulk of more promising job interaction my friends have had over the last 6 months and I'm curious if they are the new norm (along with offering no benefits). Thanks for all the great information! Be well
I'm a hiring manager here in Chicago, this is not been my case at all
Interview query CEO is a great guy. One of my friends worked for him and I got to chat with him a few times. He‚Äôs really a gem of a person. His LinkedIn posts, on the other hand, ‚Ä¶.
Eyy! I was one of the people from Reddit that you shared who was able to get a data job recently! Good luck, everyone! <3 It took me MONTHS of rage applying and tons of phone calls/interviews. You got this!
I am unemployment. My english is not fluent. I have to find a tech job in 3 months. Which one is better for finding job these days in texas, frontend or data analyst?
600 applications, BSc, MSc, 2 yoe, 3 Interviews, no job.
Definitely  interested in your thoughts on what contractor means today
Papaya
I think that to make a statement you have to also analyze the demand for jobs. For example, we now know that because of the massive layoffs in tech there is a new pool of thousands of experienced and competitive data scientists competing for the jobs. I think the data at least should include the number of applicants per job overtime.
The issue I find is that they are hiring a junior but they want the experience of a senior. All the ‚Äúentry level‚Äù jobs I find request 1-3 years of experience. Out of almost 70 applications I have only gotten 3 interviews, well I‚Äôm about to do the third this week and I hope it works out. Out of all of them I could only get data entry types even though I have a data science degree. Though I‚Äôm hopeful that I will find something eventually, I work on projects so I can have experience
Papaya
I was thinking of starting a data science degree next fall... Should I reconsider? :/
There is saturation in the market but also heterogeneity in the profiles. 
The more there will be people looking for jobs, the more employers will use severe criteria to select who they want. 

Having a masters works better than bootcamps and self taught skills. Having a portfolio works better than just having a good cv. Having some topic expertise on the data at hand (some behavioral science skills, or marketing skills...) is better than being a pure data scientist. It's not about being actually better... but about seeming more adequate to a recruter.
Hello, I am studying a BS in physics with data science as a minor. I want to get into employment as data analyst right after graduation (I have 2 more years left). What is your best advice?
thanks for share those useful papaya info
I would to add there‚Äôs a rise of job posts for Analytics Engineer.  The duties and responsibilities are a mix of data engineering, BI, database management, and data analytics.
Papaya
I work for a big consulting company, we are saturated with Data Scientists and analysts, most of our data engineers are off-shore (think India and other countries with ample talent) and there has been a steady push to leverage off-shore resources more due to clients price sensitivity (Off-shore gives clients cheaper fees and gives the consulting firm better margins). The only consulting positions related to data in consulting that are substantially recruiting is work for government contracts that often require clearance and require the employee to be a citizen. The largest need for data people in consulting rn are not function specific people who do data science or engineering but those who are considered SMRs in specific technology stacks imo. Also comes with the caveat that you need strong soft skills in addition to your data skills so not for everyone. 

Finance is hiring a lot right now and they have their pick from the best data talent.
Data job is not necessary in companies
How many of those ‚Äúnon senior‚Äù roles have senior role job descriptions? Lol
The number of data analytics recruitment is increasing in Canada actually. So, I guess, if you apply to data analytics roles instead of data science roles, you're more likely to get a job.
its the same in Software eng. but software in pharma is not impacted, I am sorry I left a job in Pharma couple of years back.
+1 to the contractor video. Right now it seems like the rates for contract work aren't great although some of the contractor firms offer benefits to offset that.
papaya?
Actually insightful, well done
consulting contract start at june and yes this is seasonal change if what you say is true. from the BPO where most jobs are moved to in ph
Love your video, I'm from a 3rd world country Nigeria üá≥üá¨, started coding python when I was 15 but wasn't consistent because of crypto trading, tho I have a degree in CS. 

I learnt data analysis last year but I had to switch out very fast to become a full stack web developer (something I have experience in) I honestly wanted something that's not really technical and won't stress me ... Truth is data analysis as a career is overrated, I feel into the hype...

Data analysis should be an ad-hoc skill in any field, I feel career prospects in data analysis is pretty low.. Data scientist and data engineering is wayyyy better for someone looking for stable job, stable pay and career prospects
Physician, Heal Thyself!
Papaya, I've heard of the September Surge, so I am looking forward to that being a positive trend!
I think one opinion that might help also is scaling up to roles where data can be applied to other fields. Like theres a difference between physics and industrial physics.
Please do a video of your views on modern contracting and market impact on number of contracting jobs.

A lot of companies over-promised on data science return on investment and since the outcome didn't meet the hype they have cut jobs.
I feel not enough analysis takes geography into consideration. The job market in a place like Boston could be completely different then somewhere like Denver.
Companies realized that what they primarely need are Data Engineers, not scientist or analysts.
What is the rate of fake job posting?
Data science is dead , long live Machine Learning Engineers
But  we already knew what you will show & your  conclusions  were already  predictable , no ?
I.e Data field is expanding?
I was affected by massive layoffs as a former Big4 tech consultant. I earned the title Senior Data Scientist but it seems like I am overqualified for the positions in the market. I positioned myself to focus on social media and build my own LLC, Originality Works LLC. I want to see how it goes being on my own but for now, the job market seems terrible.
Papaya üòÇ
Good thing about being a data professional, you can analyse why you are jobless from the data available.
Thanks for the update, Ken! Also, would love to see your new definition of ‚Äúcontractor‚Äù for data jobs. Thanks
Same with the US housing market:  bottomed in the fall of last year and now on the rebound.
Papayaü´∂üèª As a college freshman studying Data Analytics and Computer Science, it‚Äôs hard to keep myself motivated with all those news headlines‚Ä¶
Thanks for the insight and motivation!!
The solution is simple, just let the bubble pop. Companies are seeking for thousands of seniors DS/Engineers/‚Ä¶ and of course the current job market cannot supply that amount of professionals right now. And without giving opportunities to new comers, it will never be. Companies are right now in the Egg and Chicken dilemma. Once companies realize crazy salaries doesn‚Äôt justify anymore super seniors professionals, then they will give another change to juniors

As a full stack software engineer who feels concerned that LLMs and generative "AI" are a significant factor behind the downturn in demand for software dev roles, I have to admit... I'm kinda surprised to hear that demand for data scientists has dropped so much as well. I figured that you folks would be in super high demand right now.
The company i work for stopped hiring experienced engineers around the end of last year. We have ONLY been hiring college grads pretty much all year.
How about the data jobs in India?

Idk is this cuz chat gpt
Looks like it‚Äôs also possible that the Fang group is preparing for or currently integrating localized version of ChatGPT so they are firing to do more with less. Because business. Lol.
Big tech is all that makes the news and people tend to incorrectly extrapolate this to every other industry. It's not surprising but thankfully incorrect. My life hack here is to pay zero attention to "the news". üòÇ
Hey, Ken. Great video! For my own experience, I've extended 3 job offers for data scientists in the last 12 months, I am in the Fortune 300-level insurance industry.
As data engineer by Accenture I can confirm even by us there is massive decrease of new job postings and there were even some lay-offs in my platform because of contracts decrease (especially by on-premise tech stack like Oracle). The market is on the lowest point since I entered the business approx. 11 years ago. Now is not a good time to search for a job or to switch just like that (ofc some offers cannot be refused üôÇ) Anyway I get like 10 offers a month only on Linkedin alone (and I am not superman), so data engineering is still great in demand.
I talked to a local recruiter in one of the EU countries. The same situation is here. Companies were firing a lot during winter and spring, and now they are slowly starting to recruit. So, just keep calm and wait. The situation should change sooner or later.
Papaya
For data people looking for a job, rather than doing your 20th coding based udemy course, do some on business and or seek some type of business certification. Especially if you‚Äôre interested getting a data gig with a consulting firm.
Another thing is as data skills become more in demand, many jobs don't have the title of "data _____" but the jobs themselves are heavily data focused. So rather than searching for a data title, try look for data job descriptions.
papaya
I'm definitely interested in hearing your insights redefinition of the modern contractor. I've been doing some contemplation about this as well
Thanks for helping out and diving into the data, Ken!! 

I've been getting a lot of questions about the job market so it's interesting to see these insights of the downtown in May to the increase during the Summer. Things are looking good for us Data Nerds!! ü§ì
What is de inflow of new data scientists? Because I think the supply is increasing very fast while the amount of jobs stay stable.
This same thing happened a decade ago when everyone and their brother thought a 3 month boot camp was the golden ticket to a six-figure FAANG job. The surge of YouTube channels during the pandemic pushing the narrative that all you need is to learn a little SQL and Python and you're on your way to a half-a-million-dollar-per-year dream job working remotely has ruined expectations. The market (and Reddit in particular) is flooded with inexperienced/low-experience ANALYSTS who want to call themselves scientists or engineers.
Very timely information. I moved from Australia to the US and have had a difficult time finding anything. It really is difficult to start over in another country with no established network. I've heard job searches are traditionally slower in the summer due to people being off on holiday. but have been getting more pings from recruiters recently. The info about roles was helpful as I've felt like a chameleon not sure whether to focus on DE, DA, or DS roles or even my old role of BA and QA. I also have degrees in CS and DS.
What tips you want to give to beginners??
Papaya
Papaya, I have been trying to move from education into data analysis since last November. I started applying for jobs in March. I had many interviews up until June, then absolutely nothing since. It just died.
Papaya
So much hype for Data Science got busted !
haahhaha papayaaaaa :-0

Thanks for the content! I've been studying data science for a few months and I'm about to build my portfolio, even though I lack formal degrees. My top priority is strengthening my profile for remote work availability. Should I apply to similar sectors as well? Is it advisable to pursue job opportunities that list educational requirements, even if I don't have them?
Thanks!
Never underestimate the power of networking. I feel like the luckiest guy alive right now, I applied to a total of 5 jobs after my bachelor graduation in CS and thanks to a friend I met at my university from Spain who was already working in a big agency, I was able to get a data analyst & programmer remote position in his company.
heh Ken are u referring to the Canadian job market which is so comeptitive? It seems that there not enough jobs available...
I've seen the Capital One data analyst surge over the past 2 months - my coworker and I both had recruiters reaching out about Cap1 roles.  They had just laid off a ton of agile people a few months back, so that was interesting.  They are one of the largest employers in my area (Richmond, VA)
What about machine learning?
Thank you Ken for the video üåª ü•≠ (I didn't find the papaya emoji on my phone, but I like mangos)
I see data analysis as a skill, not a job. You need to have that skill to do other type of jobs, like Technical Project Manager.
Papaya
That's good. We can see the impact of data YouTubers on the market.
As a data scientist in healthcare rather than tech, I remember hearing about all the layoffs broadly, but I never saw them in my own field. Consider applying to hospitals, especially university hospitals.
Thank you for the insights. Looking forward to your next video on this topic
papaya
I think people should broaden their search on what types of data jobs they are looking for. Data Science and Data Engineering are more advanced roles...it may help to go after adjacent roles like Data Analyst, DBA, python dev, Web Development, SQL Dev, IT Support/Admin, etc
Papaya
I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science (my aspiration is to be a data scientist). Basically, in order to survive in the 21st century world of data, you have to know how to build the technology, manage it, implement it, and monetize from it.

These companies used all of the talent available to build their infrastructure and the talent was discarded.
i think people shouldn‚Äôt focus on trying to get a data job. so much data online, just learn the skills and do projects in your own time
Thank you for sharing this great topic.
Subscribed like a few min in... You nailed it on the head and respect for the podcast too. I'm sick of these AI videos talking in monotone about basic level content for nearly every topic. AI in healthcare is interesting - I work in mental health and my company works at a national level for suicide prevention and we are rolling out in a couple ways; including for quality assurance of recorded conversations to identify statements that match identifiers (Lyssn). There may be other ways leadership is looking to integrate AI. I just started at a local Intel/Dell AI Workforce program and hope to branch into AI. I live fairly close to Oregon State University and their AI program has a massive investment from NVIDIA founders for a dedicated research building. Really excited to see where this field takes me. Thanks for the inspiring work here!
Many thanks for this insightful and thoughtful video!
What about Finance?
Awesome video! Totally agree. I think one thing you didn't cover but will likely change is movies and TV shows. I think there will be several developments. 

I think, like you mentioned, barriers to entry will drop so low budget movies will be able to look amazing. This will lead to lots of niche content with strong followings. 

I also think that big budget movies will use AI to let people change movies to suit audiences better. This will start with something basic, like using AI to create a child-friendly version of a movie where nudity, violence and profanity is taken out. It'll also be used for dubbing. 

But it will go crazy when people start watching movies where they deep fake their faces onto it so they can watch the Avengers but it's you, your mates and your families in the movie and the characters actually look, sound and maybe even act like you. 

I also think that content creators will start building out the extended universe of TV shows like Star Wars. These won't be canon but it makes sense to let people take the IP and make their own fan pics and then pay a cut to the corporations that own it. There will be restrictions about how they can be used (i.e. no Star Wars porn parodies using AI to use the original cast) but it seems inevitable and makes business sense as the best stuff will make them money and everything else costs nothing. They can probably remake the best content and not even pay the original creators if they find something is working. Basically crowdsourcing blockbusters (I don't think that would be fair but that is very separate from whether I think it'll happen).
I've always thought that education was a bubble waiting to pop, so it makes total sense that AI could be the pin that pops it!
Why didn‚Äôt u just list them out instead of putting the pics only in the thumbnail, put pics and name in thumbnail in list format
Well customer service will be interesting because small businesses are a huge chunk of the market and you can't really use AI on tiny data, so I don't know how useful chatbots will be for small businesses in general. I use chatgpt daily and it struggles on anything that doesn't have a lot info/written about it. Also chatgpt still struggles with vague questions or sentences where as a human would either understand the ask or likely ask for further clarification where as AI tries to be a chad and answer based off incomplete information/sentences creating a terrible customer service experience because then you either have to reask it or think its correct when its going in the wrong direction (no real fault of the AI but really just an issue with the user input). I would say AI still has a ways to go and like most cutting edge tech is always "10 years away from being good" LOL. 

The CEO of OpenAi/chatgpt made an interesting comment saying the limit of AI might have been hit and that might take some really difficult/interesting  methods for it to even get marginally better. If that is even remotely true we might be seeing a flat line of AI growth, and I would say its like Telsa's auto selfdriving that came out (in what 2014? That's almost a decade old now) and still hasn't progressed like everyone thought. We were all suppose to have self driving cars and truckers and uber drivers were suppose to be out of job etc etc by now.
Either way you slice it my former industry ‚ÄòPlay Pro Ball‚Äô is undisrupt-able by AI
Very interesting video.
I have a question for you though.......
Would ai decrease data science or sd/se jobs? How can someone future proof themselves?
Do you think a graduate degree in biostatistics is a good start for the apply of AI in health care?
1-No impact on any real economy. Not a single grain of rice, not one brick placed by these "advances"
2- language models are not "intelligence". No matter how large they are.
It is not AI that will cause the changes. It is the way people will use it. Human to human contact is one of the great drivers of constructive activity, when this decreases humanity will increasingly become separate from each other. I'm not sure of the consequences but I am sure it will not be be helpful.
although i'm currently a cybersecurity student, i've noticed that field already utilizes AI for detecting and mitigating threats as two examples. i do wonder how much more things will augment as time goes on. c: this is probably an unpopular opinion; however, i find it rather oddly fascinating to live during this time, especially as a sci-fi lover. i compare the feeling to that of: "pinch me, am i dreaming?"
6:43 Crazy how a press release surges intrest in a tool. Especially in this Copilot case.  It's such an undervalued tool right now and X is just going to take it to another level
Does the idea of training an AI using AI-generated data seem super sus to anyone else in that we're potentially building a garbage-in-garbage-out feedback loop?
It's not necessarily bad right? I am wondering why you mentioned it's going to disrupt them specifically instead of just being integrated
you name a industry! ai will take it lol!
AI in healthcare has lots of red tape from its being utilized.
Cybersecurity and Gaming are the fields I am most interested to see how AI will disrupt the field.
Fun fact: Stoicism fans are creating a million videos of stoicism videos with AI tools each day.
What is your advice for fresherjust starting in data science industry.....???? How do we move forward and get ahead in our career....???
Your travel bag setup is on point, Ken! We're thrilled that your HP ZBook Studio G9 is helping you stay productive on the go. Safe travels and keep up the fantastic work! üëåüåç
Hey Ken, have you deleted your discord server?? And what happened to 66daysofdata?
50+ flights?? Nice man!!! Is it in your contract to travel that much?
He be flexin those arms. Thats all. Its the world agenda. You just didnt know it
My team, some members of which are ex-HP employees, is currently contemplating acquiring a Z4 G8 workstation vs. just building our own liquid-cooled system in-house. With 2 A6000s, that is one hell of an expensive machine.

Looking forward to those tutorials on that beast, though!
brb time to get half these items. thanks ken. ‚úç
for the travel neck pillow - it seems the 'correct' way to use it is to have the open part behind your head... (Things I've learned from the internet).
Love your work, and admire the community you have built around you. At 9:26 what is this keyboard?
Enjoyable video.
My bag has: my laptop, my lip balm and my loneliness
One thing I would add is an extension cord, so many times I've needed more then one power outlet...

A small nitpick -- Das Reich is not pronounced as reach, but as [Àà Åa…™√ß] (wikipedia has a good recording to check out).

So whats the mystery between you and papaya?
Hey Ken, could you do a video about job market for data scientists. How the industry has grown and where we will be at in 5 years
I'm finding myself spending many of my work hours just trying to keep up with the amount of AI research and news being published daily. The speed of this revolution is making my head spin. I cannot even imagine where we'll be 10 years from now.
I want to hear the truth - what will happen to the data analyst jobs?
what about data analyst ?
You think that study statiscs,data and math can help became a professional punter?
I have a confusion regarding AI prompt engineer demand because most of the companies actually banned the use of chatgpt due to a concern of data privacy. Can you please explain this a bit more because if most of the companies do not allow their employees to use chatgpt or AI tools like that, how AI prompt engineering would be in demand skill?
I can picture a scene where someone will blame the AI clonation for some dumb things said in a meeting üòÇ.
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if jobs in the future don‚Äôt have Prompt Engineering experience as a prerequisite.
How do we know if this video was created by the real Ken Jee or an AI KenJeeBot??
Thank you for sharing. What are the technical requirements/qualifications to be a prompt engineer?
what about data scientist as a job?
This is gonna be a revolution out there
Its a tool used to automate repeated task still we need a human touch for the creative works.

What do you think? Is the code interpreter worth the hype or is it everything you dreamed of?  Let me know üëá
U forgot to mention that ita just a couple of months old .. and its a beta version üòÇ..
On point with the solution, exactly the route I chose... thanks for the video.
Ai really could replace data analysts, but the ai tools are becoming less effective because the job market is not prepare to a ai replace. So, we need advantage tine to prepare us. It's s my opinion.
People are wasting their time optimizing their prompts. Meanwhile you can code the same task with Pandas and re-use the script whenever you want with less text. I mean I learnt annotating text in my plots with Matplotlib once, now whenever I need to annotate I turn back to my old code and use it.
CoDe InTeRpReTeR iS tAkiNg My JoB?!?! üò±
Well said. I've been using ChatGPT as a coding assistant, originally motivated from a feeling of productivity-FOMO, and am now familiar with its limitations. The biggest one is in the workflow you mention, where you have to supervise the code. The productive boost is from "writing every line" to "checking every line", which is an improvement, but not a job-destroying-10X-er that headlines would have us believe.
I couldn't agree more. The Code Interpreter is a valuable tool, but its level of maturity is not yet sufficient to replace any jobs entirely.
ChatGPT is like spell check. Ever wonder why so many native English speakers can't spell or use correct grammar? ChatGPT has it's uses but most people will just be turned into even dumber useless eaters.
Its interesting how anyone who finds the code interpreter to be "the best thing ever", has NEVER worked with data. People just don't seem to understand that the code interpreter, even if it worked flawlessly, is a very minor part of what Data Analysts do. No, it won't kill any new jobs, at least not the way it is now.
Hello Ken,
Thanks for the video.
I relate to the points you mentioned in the video.

I think that the code interpreter lacks something else as well that might be more important for an analyst. Tgat is memory. If you decide to resume your analysis later on in the the say, you practically need to restart your analysis if you didn't explicitly ask chatgpt to generate your files for download. 

And even then, you need to re-explain it to chatgpt and give it the files again as it would have discarded the files/dataframes etc... that it created while doing the analysis.

That was a big turn off for me when I tried the interpreter a few days ago. I was doing an analysis,  and decided to re-do it using to code interpreter to compare. I was impressed until I had this limitation!

Thanks again!
Finally, a genuine video.
It has only been out for less than a year though
So it's true... It's good extension for someone's learning... Apart from that one need to put good amount of efforts...

Hey Ken! Long time no speak, i just wanted to shoot you a message and see how you‚Äôve been doing? I just connected with you on LinkedIn. I still follow and keep up with you channel, amazing work man! I wanted to also talk about a second podcast, my growth and knowledge in this field has grown and i have a lot to give your viewers, along motivation that you can go from knowing nothing to leading a team.
Are these courses still on sale?
Hello, I'm very interested in purchasing the course, when I saw the video and I tried to get the money to purchase it ASAP, I was only able to get the 78$ today, but now it is only available at its original price, I know it is not really expensive to you guys, but I am from Colombia, so that price really is the monthly minimum wage, not something you can easily afford, do you see it possible to ever put the discount on again, still I think I am going to get it, it's just going to take me a couple months, I'm a college student, so it's not always easy to get the resources inmediatly, still, thank you for your amazing work and generosity, I've had in the back of my mind that I wanna be a data science for a while now, and one of the first videos that made things clearer for me, and encouraged me to start this journey was one of yours
Thank you! Your hard work and your presence on YouTube has been super motivating for me! I was able to demo my first project to my co-workers. I am so excited to see new things from you! Congrats!
üåà *PromoSM*
Congrats Ken! No doubt these are courses packed full of value!
There are so many free recources everywhere. No thanks
New Nice Be-Ken-nnings! 
ü•µ initiative!
Is the course in python??
Say less. Take my money already, Kenneth.
Hey, congrats on the courses Ken. Thanks for creating them. :D

Have you read Four Thousand Weeks, by Oliver Burkeman? I'm in the middle of the book now and it's honestly been a bit of a paradigm shift for me.

Since you mentioned feeling guilty about not being able to do ALL the things while creating these courses, I figured I'd suggest yet another something for you to do. üòÇ
Hard work deserves a good payoff. Hope it does extremely well!
congrats Ken on the launch of your course!!
Course creation is no easy task, congrats to both of you Ken and Jeff on the launch of the ML courses!
Congrats Ken!  I hope you do great with this course.

Your students are lucky to have you!
Duuude. Really proud of you man. Thank you.
Sold on 3 major things:
1. You made it clear that this is for people with some base of stats/cs 
2. This is marketed as a reference manual for fundamentals and real-world application/implementation and not a crash course to becoming a DS
3. 3 courses for $75 and lifetime access

I'm a data analyst that just started an MSDS and for those reasons, along with knowing your content/teaching style/doing your Kaggle walk-thoughs, I think it's safe to say that this deal is a no-brainer.  A reference manual on the ML process, the algorithms, and then the application in industry are great topics to cover.

FYI- I'm not gonna buy these courses to "learn the skills to become a DS" but simply as a supplement to enhance my learning/fundamental understanding of DS tools/ML.
Honestly IDK what to do at this point.  I have a GitHub, I did the Google Data Analytics Cert and I've completed heaps of Coursera and LinedIn Learning content all of which resulted in ZERO recruiters reaching out and ZERO responses to resume submissions.  Oh and most jobs are "entry-level" with 3-5 yrs of experience.  Spending another $80 seems pointless.
This is great timing! I just started my summer and was looking for a course to do. 

Can we expect to see any future limited time sales or will this be the only one?
Let's gooooo!! üôåüèº I know it's been a long time in the works and it's finally here! 

Congratss to both you and Jeff üéä
Best news of the year!
Hey Ken! Are there projects that we need to do and get feedback?
Content is amazing!! Thanks Ken and Jeff!
Congrats Ken üéâüéâ, this has been heavily needed
The course looks good, sad I can't afford it right now. I'll make a plan to save to buy it later
First üéâ...
Very interesting and inspiringüëç
I really like it. I mean customer service are very costly tbh, and a lot of customer's question can be answered by AI because the question more to be repetitive. It's exhausting to answer those kind of answers one by one every single day. AI can certainly help this task, and those CS can work on more analysing stuff
Hi Ken, I would like to ask for suggestions on how to secure data analyst interviews specifically for individuals with expertise in SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Is it possible to land an interview if I only have knowledge of SQL?
Hi Ken, I'm seeking some suggestions. I tend to get demotivated whenever I struggle to comprehend certain concepts or fail to solve tasks while taking a course. Could you please provide me with some tips on how to stay committed to a course and see it through to the end?
Hi, ken.  Can you suggest way to land interviews with expertise in SQL, power bi, and Tableau? Is it possible to land an interview knowing only SQL?
May I ask two questions:
1.does data engineer need a good communication skill, and be good at math?
2.can work freelancer as data engineer?
Thanks
Great timing. Just got a scholarship to study Data Science in my home country, Kenya and I am really glad I bumped into your channel ‚ù§
This is valuable for me and fellow friends who cant seem to escape cust service
My first jobs in tech were in the roles of support. It was highly stressful and thankless work. Recently, I joined a small core team to develop our in-house LLM to replace ChatGPT usage. One of my end goals is not to replace our tech support staff but to help them. As such, I am very interested in transfer learning and fine tuning transformers because I'll be doing exactly that very soon from now.
Dude at 5:46 needs some sun
Wow. üòØüëè Amazing coverage and hot topics to think about. Thanks so much for joining us at Zendesk Relate this year, Ken!

This has been very informative to see the process and how you included AI in it.
Half way through and just wanted to say this is very valuble content! Love the walkthrough type if content!
You are amazing - this helped me so much - I am on the beginning of my journey and trying to find videos like this where people walk through what they've done. Yours is the best I've come across so far! TY!
Thank you Ken!!! I had no idea on how to do a kaggle challenge or what was expected, but you went through the whole process and explained what each part was!!! Now I have no excuses for a boring kaggle profile
Hi Ken! thanks for making this great tutorial. Can you do tutorial on fine tuning the NLP pretrained model? there are few videos out there but I think you are more advanced on communicating the technical things so it's make us easier to understand. Thanks!
Being on a hill also means less risk of water damage given any runoff will flow downhill.  I'm assuming a depression is opposite and runoff will flow and pool towards the hoke
Hey Ken, have you tried using ChatGPT with Noteable plugin to help you solve a Kaggle competition? I used it and it works (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKfJT5QF_I), I think people will enjoy if you made a video using that
Thanks Ken for the tutorials. I'm not really a fan of your videos because they're not technical enough but I really enjoyed this and learnt a couple of things. Wish you could make more of these
I am a material scientists who works with large data sets and I want to pivot into data science because I've grown to love how data is manipulated and analyzed outside of just scientific applications.  academia has been exhausting and I want to refresh things in a new field.  Do you by chance do any personal life coaching??  regardless, thank you for your videos, they are both motivational and instructional!!
Really AMAZING video! Helps me on my grad journey breaking into data jobs
Amazing Work Ken. Thank you for explaining so thoroughly :)
This project is amazing! Can you make more videos like that please?
Thanks for the video, Ken. But with all due respect, it's less of a data science tutorial and more of a ChatGPT demo.
Hey sir, I would wanna know about this, would you recommend using powerbi for EDA process before model building than pandas?
Where have you used chatgpt?
Wonderful content as always.

But you could literally reset the default theme to 'plotly_dark'. This would have been better than repeating most of the layout update.
I think to make the code less confusing, the y_test could be replaced by y_valid like some notebooks did so the test suffix is reserved for the real test data.

Thank you for your wonderful videos and your codes are always so clean and easy to follow! Cheers!
Hi Ken! Have you had to utilize PCA before?
As a practicing data scientist, how important would you say it is to handle calculations such as integrals by hand? I studied this stuff 10 years ago and have since had my skills atrophy. Though the intuition is still there. Is it worth going through that stuff again or just diving into the deep end?
My nga, ure the best!!!
Can you make a whole playlist where you go through different projects because you have a very unique way of teaching and I think a lot of people would benefit from that
can you make a playlist for upcoming projects
Sometimes I think i picked the worst year to get into DS , I do love the field, really do, but when the market requires PHD for entry levels.. you know you got yourself into big trouble
Thank you for explaining this so well! As a beginner this gave me invaluable insight on how to approach a problem on Kaggle.
Immedietly i saw this video i also started creating the same project ü§£ thanks !!!!
Data science is dead lol
Great Timing!!Thanks.. following  to u with closely
This video is basically useless. Tell me one point that you actually suggested something other than ask CHATGPT.
7:02 What is the name of this platform (website)?
These AI tools are some of the best teaching resources ever created. It makes you wonder in the probably not-so-distant future whether it could just outright replace the knowledge jobs that we humans do.
great stuff Ken
BARd and chatGPT are too stupid or ugly at creating some codes in Swift, while they are good at Python.
Exactly üíØ I use ai to do my data visualizations. I only know matplotlib but I leverage ai to change the code using a matplotlib library to plotly!
Data Science hiring has slowed down. The demand is pretty low. It's not because of layoffs, many people might argue on this. The demand for data engineers is good but it's not same with  data science. What are your thoughts on this, the hiring slowdown for data science only @Ken Jee?
Hey Ken! So I am about to complete my undergraduate in computer science, I have adequate knowledge in python and it's libraries and also a good idea on MySQL. I have decided to pick up a specialization for my masters. I'm confused on which one to take. The idea of analyzing and predicting data really intrigues me but however I'm not that great at math overall. But I can do well in statistics though. Do you think it's worth picking up Data Science or should I lean more into Artificial Intelligence as a whole?

Also, I really love your videos and how you keep updating roadmaps constantly as times keep changing. Really appreciate your efforts!
For the features you talk about in chat gpt, are some of those part of the paid version of it? Thanks (I am someone who uses the free thing or version of it).
Hey Ken, just to let you know I'm a beginner in this field and just like a kid I was looking for how to start on type videos. Fortunately I found you and you made total sense to me regarding everything. Looking forward to follow you more on this journey and also by reading comments of other people I can deduce you are a good guide and very soon I'll find it out too ;)
Thanks for your insights, Ken. Fascinating to see how ChatGPT will influence the fields of Data Science and Bioinformatics. The tool saves a lot of time when coding or summarising text. You also need good domain knowledge to identify when the model hallucinates. ChatGPT often invents functions; you need domain knowledge to sort the good from the bad. I wonder how these models will evolve when more and more online content is generated by them.
Try writing drag and drop case. It suck at it now.
Awesome video Ken! I was surprised that data sets can be fed to chat GBT as I thought it only takes text as an input. How can I do this??
Hi Ken! Will you suggest me to transition my career into Data analytics/science despite the impact of AI. Will it be safe job for 10 to 15 years down the line??? 
Please answer....?????????‚ù§
Yamede khudasai
You recommend 3.5 or upgrade to the GPT-4 via GPT plus or alternate access?
Love the video! As a beginner, what would be the best way for me to feed ChatGPT the initial data? Where could I get some mock data from?
A jits dummy! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hi Ken, awesome video as always! I'm finishing my PhD in Physics next month and planning to leave academia to go into data science. I've found your videos on these topics incredibly insightful. I've been using ChatGPT to start doing some fun side data science projects and learn more about Machine Learning (took a course in it like ~4 years ago, so very rusty on the topics), and it has been incredibly helpful as a knowledgeable assistant. For someone with coding experience in Python but maybe not expert developer level, ChatGPT is so good at getting one started at learning how to use new packages and tools that are outside of one's current knowledge base. I know several friends who are also planning on leaving academia and trying to break into data analysis/data scientist roles, so I will be recommending them to your channel!
What certificate is good for eastern Europe beginners in Data Analytics?
Great video! Is creating code a premium feature? I have the free subscription and chatgpt told me it couldn't create code
Someone with no DS/ML knowledge wouldn't know if ChatGPT makes a mistake and how to fix it. A data scientist would.
‚Äã Thank you Ken for this video. I signed onto your course on Udemy about "How to Start a Career in Data Science 2023". Great content.
 
You and @DataNash are definitely my guide because I'm new to this from a very different field and it feels overwhelming what I have to learn to be able to even get an interview in the UK.
Leveraging Ai is good, but.. Ai Jobloss is coming fast. Can we please Cease Ai / GPT? Or start by Pausing Ai before it‚Äôs too late?
Im new and doing all of what u said wow! Looks like im going to make it üòÜ
On point! I was totally surprised with people's reaction that this AI explosion would make data science *less* relevant, due to automation. At this time, massive amounts of money are getting poured into machine learning. So my reaction was the opposite. And since using ChatGPT and having some familiar with their scaling laws, I don't see DS getting abstracted away. You said it better than I could üëå
Thank you so much for the video . I had the same questions and your answer was really good.
Thank you so much for this
Elite editing on this and honestly I think data scientists are well positioned for the new ai world
Really well edited, scripted, and important video for today
Hey Ken. You're one of my biggest inspirations by far. No really, you got me to read David Goggins' book, same with Dr Sinclair and others (keep those recommendations coming).

I have a request, I totally like this series of "If I could start over" but could you add like... some more philosophical emphasis on why ?

Just imagine for a second a total loser who cannot take anything much less himself seriously for a long enough time frame. 
How would that person go about taking proper accountability for their learning especially in these turbulent times ?

Like.... this hypothetical loser (totally not me, I win so much) can't take college too seriously but wants to learn anyways, they need a direction and purpose.

How might you transform that person  ? 
My questions :

What are concepts and hard lessons you WISHED you could have learned earlier ?
What are your proven methods of success ?
What would be your guide/map that you could hand to a younger self  to escape the so called "matrix".

From finances, emotional management, opportunity cost. EVERYTHING !

"The portal is closing, we don't have much time kid. QUICK ! Take this, and stay the course" type of information ?

Thank you for taking your time.

I appreciate all the hardwork.
This was very helpful! I re-started my data analyst learning recently and feel a bit lost of where begin again. Currently studying python and sql. I'll be sure to check your other vids out as well. Thanks again
I just finished my google data analytics professional certification. As someone who only has knowledge in data through excel, chatgpt was very helpful in my studies. I find SQL and R were the most challenging parts of the course, but chatgpt was able to make it easier for me to digest by asking it how the functions and syntax relates to excel and break the topics down into a lot more digestable chunks. I'm currently using GPT4 to expound my ideas into feasible projects to add to my portfolio. 

I would also like to add that you have no idea how your videos were super helpful in my data learning journey. Thank you so much Ken!
Your gains bro. You looking crazzzy. Good job. Great video as well.
I love your approach, but I still feel like beginners should be cautious, AI tools are still not the most reliable, and like you said, they tend to hallucinate. Love the video though!
Your perspective and approach is very good as always. Thank you.
Very informative
My kid is going to choose Data science &AI at college but I'm afraid there aren't going to be enough jobs for juniors by the time my kid graduates.What do you think of it? Could you share your opinion on this?
hello sir
I am going to apply for junior data scientist position.
so by reading the description can you suggest me what sorts of project should I need to do.
Hi, ken.  Can you suggest me how to land intedview with expertise in sql, powerbi, tableau. Is it possible to land interview knowing only sql?
Maybe I'm not your audience but found the intro so tedious that I moved on.
Hi Ken.  Thanks for this great video.  I am planning to study computer science.  But since the launch of chatgpt and all the other AI tools, I've only heard of programmers being replaced.  Should I change my mind about computer science or just ignore all this talk?
I, for one, welcome our AI overlords.
AI cant replace papaya farmers. Checkmate AI! lol
I still think it's overrated. Not sure but my experience writing with AI has been the same. Sure it helps and increases your efficiency in lots of use cases but when building end to end projects relying on AI especially in software dev is just not going to work.

I used to spend 2 hours on debugging but when AI loses it I spend more than a day debugging where it messed up
Honestly I got demotivated learning Data Science because of AI that I stopped for 2 months but your video gave me hope on how I can actually speed up my learning and do more using these tools. Thanks a lot man üëèüèæ‚ù§
I tried chat gpt this week, it helped me come up with a machine learning algorithm that I was too afraid to dive into. I could have done it without chatgpt but it‚Äôs extremely faster than googling. It got stuck once or twice but rewording my question usually worked for it.
Ken! You should do a podcast with some of your friends about this topic -- maybe Tina since she also released a video with similar vibes. Would love a long form discussion about this pivotal moment.
How do we know that "The Real Ken Jee", hasn't already been replaced with "AI Ken Jee"!?!?! üò≥
The new fireüî•
You really consolidated my thoughts on AI into a succinct video. Now the question is, did you write the script or did ChatGPT?
Can you combine smart glasses with AI?
Starting my master's degree in computer science with data analytics in September.... a little nervous I'll be obsolete by the time I graduate! Won't give up, but it is unnerving all the same. And I'll incorporate AI where I can to be effective.
My opinion for people is if you have the choice, plan for a job that uses AI as a tool rather than something that it can automate, atleast for now. This is a new technological era that we don't have answers to just critical rational thought with some logical implication and illogical creativeness to prepare for all scenarios. Better or for worse, no one really knows the best plan, I personally say join them and make friends with them in a sense
What a great video. U touch on all the relevant points. Defenetiley needs sharing
I would be really grateful if someone can tell me an I wasting 40 hours per week by learning Python, Linux and Networking, due to rise of AI. Thanks!
Thanks for watching everyone! I promise this is me and not Chat GPT (contrary to what the end of the video may suggest)
how does it handle angular?
It isn't that great. It even struggles every now and then with a baby language like AutoHotkey and even struggles to differentiate v1.1 and v2 and sometimes makes things up that aren't true still. It can write prototype code and you adjust it from there. That's pretty much it.
dude that ending...... hahaha
I am also using GPT 4 for coding a while i can say its 70% accurate than previous iterations but it also makes mistakes sometimes it forgets methods which are necessary and don‚Äôt know the flow of code.
Looks like a lot less need for software engineers then
Before it was very hard to find the specific solution to my problem but now, I just had to ask chatGPT then validate if the response is right or wrong
I see ChatGPT 4 for software development as both a learning and productivity tool.  I can easily see a future interview where I have to demonstrate conversational programming utilizing ChatGPT 4 and then explaining the code it has written.  I don't think it will replace programmers, but will result in programmers with more productivity.
Not lying about that soon u won't be coding at all üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Same with writing. I hope craft of writing will no longer be deemed the end goal. Like how calculators have replaced silly algorithms for basic maths.
ShatGPT is only as smart as the data it is trained on, making its use cases very limited.  If you trained it on the collective knowledge of 6 year old children, the software is incapable of giving you a 12 year old's answer.  

The more you learn about AI, the more you realize how absurdly stupid the whole approach to AI is.
Ending was a good touch haha
Been hearing that a lot of the junior positions for Data Analysis are gonna be dead thanks to IA, what do you think?
Clearly Ken just wanted to flex his biceps
We think a lot faster than anything we do, not just coding. Conversational coding, in your terms, works so well in my humble estimation because once that thing starts spitting out the code to what you want to accomplish, you can get right back to work ideating. When I used to code without chatGPT, my mind would be flooding with ideas and the mechanical distraction of trying to type with minimal errors and get the code down BEFORE I forget the next thing I want to work on that keeps intrusively disrupting. Now, I type my request, it does its thing, and I'm way more likely to keep the train of concepts flowing. Sometimes I'll furiously scribble some indecipherable reminder while it's outputting, so I can return to that line of thought after I double check its work.

This thing is beyond a game changer.
I feel like I got promoted from code monkey to project manager on all my personal projects. If they're really worth anything, we're about to find out because my job is ideation, direction, and integration and chat gpt is my programming team. I'd call it Prompt Coding. The better your prompts, the better the code
With IA's getting improved, would it be wise to start to learn data science and spend more than 1 year learning about it ?
I think what a lot of people failed to understand, is that AI is a function and humans are the input. Without proper input (or prompts), there's no way AI can function therefore everything you're learning at present is still very valuable and important because your input helps to verify, identify & validate the expertise of the subject. Please don't be that person who takes AI prompts as replacement for everything because it just proves you're not an expert of the field! Why are you somehow speaking on behalf of lawyers as a content writer ?????
Dear GPT-4, please write the transcript for the video "I'll Never Code the Same Again... (GPT-4 is OP)". Thanks, Ken. 
üòÑ
We also need to worry about using ChatGPT to potentially code ourselves out of a job. Tina just released a video about this herself, and she's freaking out.
Dude is swole üòç
What a twist üòÇ
Do you think OpenAI would take any responsibility of it's ai product if it leads your apps to something wrong?  Are you the only ONE to face any legal or other consequences. Even Images it provides is based on some existing images. They might have copyrighted.
I would like to know your thoughts on how GPT-4 would affect the data analytics world in terms of employment. I'm almost done with the Google data analytics certificate and its pretty nerve-wracking. Although AI cannot fully replace the job, it might lower, if not, eliminate the demand for junior analysts. I am planning to take AI courses in Coursera though to hedge my skillset in this hyped up AI period. Great video as always!
Genuinly scary end üòÇ
I agree with "loosing human touch, but not really loosing creativity, coz AI helped us to type what is in our mind, and that is creativity of human mind, so don't ask how to build something, but ask about some problem when we build something..maybe this is just my thoughts
I have talked about GPT-4 vs GPT-3 on my own channel as well. The difference is HUGE! GPT-4 is a different beast, at least for me a programmer. But in comparison to the release of ChatGPT, there is almost no hype around it.
Would you mind sharing how you did the animation with ChatGPT? Would really appreciate that üôÇ
holy shit the ending ‚ò†‚ò†
Ahahaha the ending killed me! Nice touch ‚ù§ Your creativity hasn't died with the automation üåª My coding style also changed completely especially for specific usecases!

However, one concern I have is the ability to develop professionally and understand the code you're using. I am currently using Django and I just pasted a normal plotly chart to ChatGPT and asked it to convert it to plotly.js to be rendered. It works but if I didn't spend time trying to learn what it did I would've had a fully functional interactive chart with no idea about the syntax.

Of course I know enough to be able to copy paste, but do you think this is something to be worried about and we each have to understand what it writes ü§î?

Thanks man! Can't wait to meet someday :)
‚ÄòConversational coding‚Äô is very good label. I‚Äôve been experimenting and using it similarly for method blocks. This whole thing feels like another abstraction upwards for a greater productivity
Great ending haha üëè
Shoot, I've been using it to just learn python.
Well, I hope that John Connor will be prepared for the KENMINATOR haha. Jokes aside, the chatGPT had improved a lot my productivity, I can do more in less time. It's a great tool.
1:34 see Ken's chat history üòÇ
One of the things I've loved with chatGPT is that it understands the "why" so if you're trying to solve a problem, and it's giving you code you don't understand why it's there, you can ask why it is, and it will give a detailed breakdown to explain it to you so you aren't just flying blind. 

That's just as helpful, to me at least, as any of the code it produces.
Any ideas what this means for the data science / AI job market? 

I started a masters in data science in February, coming from Finance. I love this stuff, so I‚Äôll just go through with it regardless, but it now seems to me that there will be 0 need for junior data scientists when I finish my masters next February
Thank you!
Great info. People should narrow their job search to 2-3 industry's and then have several projects for each industry. Or have some amazing projects that cross over realistically.

If interested in real estate and want to work for a company life Redfin/Zillow, have projects that look at real estate.
Great advice!!  So let's say that I want to end up with a data science position related to the music industry or to soccer in some way.  Do you have any suggestions on how to tailor learning in that way??  Just look for relevant data and try to build a presentation??  Reach out to someone in one of those industries??  Thanks as always!!
How do you not get overwhelmed by choice when designing your portfolio? There are so many articles on what it could look like and which projects to feature
Which networking platforms do you find most useful In this regard except LinkedIn?
So saying a fun fact about me doesn't work?
The problem is that everyone asks for experience, even for junior positions
i am thinking about studying data science is it possible to work as a data analyst and data engineer with a data science degree
as much as data science interests the hell out of me i know data engineering is more in demand so i‚Äôve been studying that. it‚Äôs been fun so far.
What be your approach to get into data science after some career gap. Yes I'm studying data science. Building up my resume right now with some projects. But still worried if I can land a job or not.
I would love to know the differences between all three
I just completed my data analyst course , Am I able to shift from data analyst to data engineer role in future after working 1-2 year as a analyst
Do you think is possible to get a data engineer job in an entry-level position ü§î?
What about Machine Learning Engineers?
Nice try
Naaah they read my mind üòÇ
Me and my friend where randomly talking about a specific recipe...that second, the same recipe (as a video) came up on my phone ads. 

They're listening to us
This doesn‚Äôt not answer the question you yourself asked and made a video about
Maybe they are really listening.
Important question how does the phone know who's my friend üò® also what if i never had a friend üò®üòÆ
Never split the difference
So good they can‚Äôt ignore you
Crucial conversations
4 disciplines of execution
The one thing
A few weeks ago I had a conversation with a work colleague on Teams and mentioned the book 'Worker Leadership' and said that it was largely a case study of implementing a program at John Deere Harvester. Then I started getting ads for John Deere Harvester on my phone (a different device). I am a librarian and live in the suburbs. No activity I've performed on my phone would suggest such an ad. My conclusion is that my phone is listening to me.
Then how the social ads are always on point without even me searching for that thing!
I do believe they listen, I always get recommendations when I speak on certain thing.
If you're not the consumer, you're the product.
Lol. My phone goes ‚Äúuh-huh‚Äù every other day
I was thinking myself to pursue data science for a few years before moving to project management so this is quite eye opening.
Do you believe there is as much room to grow in an on hands role as there is in a management role ?
Have you been using chatGPT for your work? Let me know how below!
Can you make update in road map to reach the job opportunity more faster after chat gbt and other machine learning tools that will affect in data science role .and thanks for your efforts to make this video ‚ù§
Why not develop your own chatbot using data that you trust instead of using someones blackbox?
Great v√≠deo! It just goes to show that we can be friends with ChatGPT as data scientists.
Hi, ken.  Can you suggest to me how to land interviews with expertise in SQL, power bi, and tableau? Is it possible to land an interview knowing only SQL?
Hi, ken.  Can you suggest me how to land intedview with expertise in sql, powerbi, tableau. Is it possible to land interview knowing only sql?
Hi, ken.  Can you suggest me how to land intedview with expertise in sql, powerbi, tableau. Is it possible to land interview knowing only sql?
i like how honest u are about this wish more people were this way
Hi.. i need your help in my profession. I am in taxation department and have to analyse 100's of spread sheet generated by different platforms.. please guide which language or set of skills i should learn to improve my performance and work efficiently. Please guide looking forward for your response
Data science ppl r in trouble
I'm hoping between this video and Tim Ferris' "The 4 Hour Work Week" my retirement is right around the corner.
Hi Ken Jee. I am currently doing Masters in Data Science, still in my 1st year. Could you recommend types of projects I could work on to add to my portfolio? What do you think could make me stand out?
Based upon your use cases, it should more likely be saving 4-5 hours each day.
Guys I have met Ken Jee in person and this guy is 100% not him. I'm convinced ChatGPT generated this video to make it seem like he's still in control of this YouTube channel...
Great video! ChatGPT is also super useful for writing unit tests
If you all have not read the article: *Coding won't Exist in 5 Years*

Go and read it. Thank me later :)
Nice video! It made my work life easy as well
Ooh interesting usecase for refactoring! I have been mainly using it for text generation and debugging/help in Python/Django
A game changer tbh
Another great use is for when you get an error
I remember my grandpa saying he thought he would never sell out, but he eventually started to use the power tools üòÖ
Great video! As a university student still learning Data Science, I definitely see the benefits you provided in the video. However, I'm worried that with more people using chatGPT, this will increase competition in the job market since more people will have developed and polished code and projects.
Everyone following on LinkedIn knew this video was inevitable ever since that post on ChatGPT a couple of weeks ago üòÇ
I like your Chat GPT buddyüòÇ

I finally tried it only yesterday(I know, I am s≈Ç√≥w) and I felt huge amount of gratitude for making my studying a loot easier so
I could almost give Chat GPT a  gratitude hugüòä
I had been waiting for you to do a video on chatGPT. This was actually extremely well thought out and non biased. Excellent video!
ChatGPT help me learning MLOps and complex concepts in deep leearning; now i'm focus on IA research so... a great advance
As usual great content bro. Can you do a video reaction on Bing Browser and it's benefits for Data Scientists?
I use MATLAb as a research data scientist student

The chatGPT help me both in coding and research.
Coding:
- fix the bug error
- convert my slowly for and while loop to functional code that faster
- creat visualisation that fit to my dataset

Research:
- suggest methods and ideas
- suggest research paper base-on impact score, relatively, and comment  from reviewer.
- summarise pros and cons of paper and methods  in paper
Great video ! Keep them coming.

So why did you come back though
I cant report IT interesting
Do you think AI is a threat to data jobs and if so which?
I have a similar internal battle between continuing to pursue Data Analytics or to get into Data Science. You're so right though, the role and day to day are going to massively influenced by what kind of company you're at (culture, tech stack, data maturity)
I did this where I work and I‚Äôm going to be helping develop some customer metrics with our product data science team.
Thanks for sharing this. I have taken the course but ...
Right on. I know you've touched on this before and I brought it up in your IG shorts as a reference, and glad you put it out there for all of us. Keep climbing Ken. You're an inspiration for us moving into 2023.
This is a million dollar suggestion I have ever heard from a data scientist.
Honestly, I did not know the difference when I started learning, I picked up the skills of a Data analyst halfway and somehow I got into Data Science and Machine Learning. Now I am everywhere not sure of where to stay. @KenJee_ds what will you advice
Thank you. So based on this, do you think choosing a specific domain to start with is important before starting as a Data analyst.

I mean you're a sport data scientist but I discovered I have portfolio projects on several fields, I feel I shouldn't limit myself as I am still searching for my first job but at thesame time I feel it's also causing a lot of confusions for me right
Thanks for sharing this man. Your channel was the first one I started following when I decided to transition into a data science from a JavaScript software engineer. For the record, I am still in that transition, wish me luck.
Can totally see this. I'm doing my Masters in Big Data and most of it until now has been Python, we're just starting to now cover R and I'm so glad that's the way they chose to structure it
If you never coded before, start with Python. The end!
My first language was c and trust me learning it really well and doing a lot of problems in it will let you understand mostly all the other languages
Similar to how learning human language works.
Unless you have family obligations or something like that, you shouldn't ever do anything just for the money.

I'm pretty well off, but I wouldn't call myself rich. However, I have something rich people will probably never have: enough.
‚ÄîDon‚Äôt go into IT for money
‚ÄîDon‚Äôt go into medical for money 
‚ÄîDon‚Äôt go into legal for money 

Where do I go for money? Rob a bank?üòÇ 
If you are making that kind of videos, explain please where people should go for money. I‚Äôd be very interested to hear
Only a child would say that
It‚Äôs just weird how this man really encouraged me to pursue data science, and his latest videos seem ‚Äú disencouraging ‚Äú
Looks like you might be frustrated for a while.

Thanks for the encouragement, man! Appreciate that!
I recently started my first real data science project since I always practice projects using hands on projects on youtube and work step by step with the youtuber. This first project I have started is from Zindi and I am working with this project for over a month now...I definitely learnt wayy more than I expected.  At first I was just doing what i learnt from the other hands on projects and I was like "How come this project feels easy ?" Then bam! I asked a mentor to guide me and I found this project is wayyyyy complicated and advanced for me..mind you this is supposed to be a begginer friendly project...if anyone can assist me I would really appreciate it. 

PS : I have been learning DS for 8 months now but I don't feel ready to apply for any internships.  I only have kaggle Certifications ...also let's connect on linkedin..would love to learn from everyone
Thanks for the detailed guidance! Actually I was considering writing a data-powered sports analytics content, do you have any suggestion where to find project on a player's performance analysis? or anywhere I can get guidance on how to improve my work?
Going to University next semester for Comp Sci and Stats. Is it unrealistic to find internships in the data science field for relatively newer programmers? If so, what's the recommended course of action for getting real-world practice in Data Science?
Gracias!!
Great video!
Great video.

I've posted the following on many big channel:
"...
All US techs are forbidden for Syria by US rules.
This is not a civilized act from a great country like US.
US prevents Syria from OpenAI, Oracle, Android, Google services, Kaggle, and more and more... 
I just want to know WHY.
..."
2:19 Fake it until you make it!
Great info!!!! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
Nice vid. If the dog had their own like button, i‚Äôd push that too. üê∂
I recently built my first streamlit dashboard. Amazing learning process diving in headfirst while knowing very little about streamlit
Good points... Thanks for sharing üëè
True and I just told myself that I am not gonna confuse quality and quantity
My advice, choose an industry that you think is interesting and start applying. You may even need to take a non DS role to get the DS role, but you walk in with industry experience. It's about career capital. What's the best career capital? Industry knowledge. Everything falls after industry knowledge.
I have tried to learn as much as possible in 6 months from ML to tableau,power bi etc yet they reject me. They are like looking 6 years experience full stack data scientist ML engineer who can organize their non existent 1 person data science team
Look for employers that want to bring in new skills not roles for the team. In my team we collectively have a variety of skills and knowledge, one of us know Oracle, another knows Snowflake, and another knows Application development. I am trying to be the guy that knows Azure. Together we have the skills required to accomplish our goals as Data Architects. In fact my job role isn't called Data Architect like the rest of my team is, its Analyst in Data Management which proves my point. But that doesn't stop my manager from going around and telling people I am a Data Architect.
Companies look for the Unicorn, a data scientist that knows data engineering, business intelligence. This is damaging my mental health since I feel like I am never enough.
Agreed! One of the most competitive industries in the world because of how amazing the job is! Like you said it is possible for anyone to break into the field..but they need to put in enough time, resources and have a positive attitude.

I have seen many people get into data science, but I have seen even more struggle to land a true data science job even after obtaining a graduate degree in a data science related major
Data science is beautiful.
I got info DS by learning the stuff on my own, took me 2.5 years and I do not have a degree. Been working as DS for a year and then switched to analytics engineering. It‚Äôs 100% possible guys, don‚Äôt give up!
I‚Äôm doing a program through the VA (Vet Tec)to do a Data Science bootcamp, background in Econ,Calc,Stats, and enrolled in a Masters programs for Data Science, why am I doing this to myself idk lmao but here I am, there I go
Thank you. This just motivated me
Don't scare people, I came from a mathematical background and I studied one year in actuary and now I work as a data analyst come on
How long before minimal requirements qnd basic knowledge is met? I would think it's more optimistic than that.
I will become the most successfull data scientist , learning from last 6 months but have 1 year + exp in Python programming , don't even feeled bored a single day.
You have to have both creative and technical knowledge of how the world works, and that's where the real challenge is, not in the lines of code and libraries.
This is the same man that said you can learn data science in six months ?
Yep...and with Time passing by, the level required will be higher and higher ^^
Hello sir I'm from India and I feel very proud when i see your positive perspective and good advices you are giving to people.  I appreciate it very much.üî•üî•üôè
Nice one!
In salary point of view whether I should become Data scientist or software engineer
Faker Scientist < ML Engineer
Could you make a Video on how ChatGPT or rather AI could influence the future of data science?
+1 to the Fundamentals of Data Engineering book!
Love your channel. I‚Äôm trying to decide net data science and software engineering for grad school. You‚Äôve been super helpful, keep up the great work!
Great short
Thanks for your advice
Thanks for the video
even to automate and clear the bugs, it‚Äôll require data scientists
Code interpreter enters
Yeah, also we need people to clean and organize the data which AI can't do
Accounting is literally at high risk of automation üëÄ
Data science is much more than ML, just saying
Makes total sense, especially when you compared it to accounting.
How do you approach solving ambiguous work
Great advice Ken!
I'm comfortable with all three and I also love math and coding but I'm confused that should I go for masters in big engineering colleges
As my college now is not good enough
What do you mean by number 1?
Number 1 is actually my experience could you talk about it more in future videos? Love your contentüòä
Will these jobs be remote or just "in office"?
Can you find the secret papaya we hid in the video?
i am currently reading atomic habits.
1. Never split the difference
2. So good they can't ignore you
3. Crucial conversation
4. Four disciplines of execution 
5. The One Thing
will data science become obsolete because of chat gpt or other AI chat bots?
The only book missing is Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte! Also, Cal Newport is the G.O.A.T.
Thanks Ken, Alway's appriciate the time and effort you put into your videos. What natural talent Tina is as an extra in this video, she should consider having her own youtube channel üòò
Great video Ken! The One Thing had a big impact on me too. The principle seems so easy, but it's so profound.
Suggestion for new content: Make a video about when to use and why the maths you mentioned here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSwM5uVeylU  , use them in a real world problem or If cannot find real world problem, just make up something that can still happened 

and at least focus more in statistic, linear algebra, and calculus
Thanks, I love the One Thing, and I‚Äôll read othersü•∞
Also how about any technical/ data science books? What are the top 5 books in that you wished you read or would recommend in Data Science?
I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and want to instead go into Data Science instead of the traditional Software Developer/ Software Engineer career. So as someone like me who eventually one day wants to work in data science industry, is there an entry level job role that one can apply as a starting point and just get promoted/ level up to a data science in time rather than just trying to apply for a data science position from the get go? I dont mind starting at the bottom and working my way up the ladder.
Based books recommendations üëè.
Thanks. Hi Tina
I haven't read any of them but the one I've heard most of is Atomic Habits. Will be adding them all to my list now, great stuff Kenüëç
Well, i honestly read CARL NEWPORT books , but his book as you recommended (DEEP WROK),I have reservations against the basic idea. This book reflects the idea of FOCUS. And every smartly puts his point across the whole book. But I find he desperately fails with how someone with actually in the sphere of social media marketing would survive,if he opts for what he recommends? No offense to what he does, does not necessarily mean can be easily applied by others in more sort of technological fields. May be or not he would have been overwhelmed by writer journey.
Thanks for the recommendations ! I definitely need to check those as I'm starting my Python Dev / Data Scientist career !
Cal Newport is a great author. Taught me about Deep Work!
I think reading is also an art... Thanks for the recommendations Ken... üëè
Amazing content as always, Ken! Thank you for your recommendations.
One channel i wish i didn‚Äôt unsubscribe earlier üòÇ
Thanks for your recommendation
Tina is so funny )
Atomic habits changed my life. Will check out the others.  Thank you
Great suggestions! I read One Thing when I was a teenager and I remember bringing a change in my life for like a month haha. Time to re-read it! Will definitely read the other books.
I read the one thing book, it completely changed my life.


I read it because of yuor linked in books recommendations.

Thank you
Great video Ken! I read Deep Work once but i think i will reread it in the near future
Will read all this year. Already done with Atomic Habbits and Deep Work.
So Good They Can't Ignore You is such a good book.
That perfectly fits my current situation. I am very excited to try out the suggestions you provided üî•üî•
Thanks üéâüéâ
Thank you for choosing the topic
After i am done typing some else code , can i put it on Kaggle and cite that i am using this code for learning purposes in my file.
Yeah, the mindset to be original blocks using others code but learning cannot start without referring to already available code.
Imma try to implement this!, thanks for the quality content my man üëè
Happy Lunar New Year to you and your family
Thank you
Great advice, this is also how I keep on learning. Just look at what smart people are doing ;)
This is great Ken! I‚Äôm going to start using this approach
#ad #dontbeadickandnottellpeoplethisisanad
Atlast somebody told the truth
So in other words, data scientists are fake coders?
Hi ken what is the best resource to learn pandas...i have been learning python but also started pandas after a while...what is best free resource to learn pandas according to you? Also any resource that explains handling time and date and time series analysis of data
Which book or course for pandas would you recommend? For data science.
Data science is dead. (ChatGPT)
First comment is that python should be shot and buried in a shallow grave.
should I have to have a master‚Äôs degree or a doctorate in order to work as a data scientist or not??
I started learning data science last month, and planning on applying it in Biology. Please can you recommend free bootcamp or courses. Thank you
Such a great video! Can you make a video about the stacks needed for data science? I read an article on "the dark side of data science" which said that learning learning data cleaning and the algorithms is just small a part of it. You also need to have data engineering skills, like Snowflake, AWS, Hadoop etc. Because in a real world project you need these too. Is it true? Thanks for your response!
This is actually a g pretty good advice. It can help you to be more efficient in your learning journey and put the most effort on specific areas you‚Äôre not so good at, since the roadmap is personalized.
Ken is there one or two programs that are a better value?
Give Ben some extra motivation by sharing your learning goals for the year below!

Hey I feel like the universe has allowed me to see this video a year later.  Hey I like food too.  üòÇ
I love you, Ben!!! üòòüòòüòò
that was helpfull
Your videos are awesome. I would appreciate your opinion on whether you think a bootcamp is a preferred method of learning DS fundamentals, or if I would be better off using less expensive classes that cover the same material? IMPORTANT: My employer is offering to pay for a bootcamp, so that's my main reason for considering one (if I were paying myself I would probably not entertain a bootcamp). I guess I'm asking: "Do you think the structure and material organization in a bootcamp would be significantly better/faster for learning DS fundamentals?" If not, I'll save my employer some money and they'll be happy about that. Also to your point in this video, I can probably create a more individualized learning path for my employers specific needs outside of a bootcamp. Thanks again for all your awesome content!
I like the video ‚ù§ Super funny and informative! My goal is landing a job as Data Scientist in humanitarian sector
I'm no spring chicken and I feel dipping into Data Science at my age might be brutal, but I'm giving it a go. It's either move with the times or step aside and watch. Thank you for your videos, you might see me pop in once in awhile.
Such a funny video.
Can I ask what range your salary is for sports data science
I do relate to the "tutorial loop", I am stuck into one. Thanks for the video, now I can really start to learn.
00:00 Introduction to learning data science and the traps to avoid
00:59 Don't start at the beginning, set a specific goal
02:18 Create a detailed learning plan with milestones
03:50 Don't wait for perfect conditions, get started now
04:39 Use multiple resources and work on real-world projects
06:22 Share your work and collaborate with others
07:22 Avoid asking for help too soon, develop problem-solving skills
08:18 Don't give up, stay committed to your data science aspirations
Hi.
I'm interested in pursuing Biomedical informatics. I'm currently in tutorial hell. Any help and discussion is welcome.
What do you think:
I want to learn data science to be able to solve some problems, especially in my continent(Africa). And I want to be able to build revolutional product.

However, I don't know yet what product I want to build or what problem I want to solve.
oh damn I am Ben, ty
As you were saying about tutorial hell I just realised that I am stuck in a road map hell. I've been watching many road map videos on yt, and still don't know where to start. Everyone says maths is very important and I am afraid if I can take it or not. I am not that bad at maths but still I am afraid that what if I won't be able to learn it and wouldn't that be a waste of time.. There goes my dream of growing a career in machine learning. Btw I am good at programming and that's the only reason I have to learn machine learning.
What's about asking for help from chatgpt?
I feel called out
That's such a funny example. I have a BS in food science and getting my MS in data science now, and I am in the same boat of wanting to do data science for a large food conglomerate just like Ben
When need practical short course on how to learn applied statistics with hands-on examples
Hey, Very nice video and that is what i believe that self-learning is important rather than relying on someone all the time. I have one question, as I am learning data science & working on projects. I am good at coding & ML but when it comes to present the analyzed data like i am struggling to present it or understand real insights of it in a better way which is the most important, can you suggest any video/website or anything that can really help me?
Great.... hope i would have found it earlier....
Your videos are a HUGE inspiration!! just started out my own youtube (from my experience as a data analyst) All the best!
man so boring i zoned out through entire video
Thanks for the fun video. ‚ÄúBen‚Äù is a hoot. üéâ. For your audience out there, I would like to add that becoming a data scientist is a journey, and it can be longer than you expected.  Length depends on your prior knowledge and your goal post. Also, expect to modify your goals along the way.  If after 6 months you can‚Äôt make any progress, then you can revisit your goal.  Some percentage of people who try will realize this is not for them or that they have minimal aptitude for it. That‚Äôs perfectly fine and normal. Your efforts to study Data Science will still be useful in any other field you go into, since some familiarity with AI is becoming a necessity.  Otherwise if after 6 months you do see yourself making some progress, then great. Make a small course correction based on what you have learned, and set your next 6 month goal.  Repeat until you land a job.  Then repeat some more as you advance in your career.  üòä
Data science is not "import Tensorflow as tf".
My goal is to become a data scientist specifically in the video game industry! Thanks ken for keeping my motivation up!
Hey Ken do you think starting with a data analyst role and then moving into data science role is a good idea??
Hey Ken 
This was really a motivational video on my side. I am actually based in Africa, so can I learn the field of Data Science completely for free through an intensive 8 months program established by me and land a job abroad in the field?
didn't know my name is Ben
The tutorial hell is quite real!
My goal is to be able, in a year from now, to feel capable of landing a job as a Data Scientist. Preferrably on something related to language processing, due to my liking of languages.
Great video. If you guys didn't catch it having a portfolio on streamlit is an A1 advantage above others :D
I always enjoy your videos Ken :D
i feel attacked....
Hello to Ben from me. Took me a long time to even settle on data science as the career path and my goal is to build a career in research. Right at the moment research doesn‚Äôt feel plausible to get a job so I am tackling finance to get into data science in financial industry. Hope it works and wish me all the best üòÖ
I know it says don't start from the beginning but what if I feel like I need to brush up on my foundations with linear algebra and statistics/probability?
Hi, Ken. I have few questions?
1. How to show my tableau, powerbi, excel project? I meant How do I show recruiter my powerbi and tableau project. 
2. Do my project need to be an end-to-end project where I should be using a single dataset showing data manipulation using SQL and then export it to tableau or powerbi for creating dashboard. Is it okay to have SQL project, tableau and powerbi project different from one another.
3. I have difficulties while solving complex SQL queries. I need lot of time to solve complex queries. In beginner level role, how much complex queries I need to prepare for interview. Do interviewers ask complex queries to solve in live interview or give complex queries as task or assignment to solve?
4. how do I know I am ready to sit for powerbi and tableau interview? I meant how much do I need to know about powerbi and tableau to sit for an interview.
I need a roadmap for  learning data science in robotics domain
Hey @Ken Jee i already asked this in your most recent video but thought i would ask here again. Can you help me with this question. I feel like your the most knowledgeable person to ask this. I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and want to instead go into Data Science instead of the traditional Software Developer/ Software Engineer career. So as someone like me who eventually one day wants to work in data science industry, is there an entry level job role that one can apply as a starting point and just get promoted/ level up to a data science in time rather than just trying to apply for a data science position from the get go? I dont mind starting at the bottom and working my way up the ladder. If anyone else can help with this, it would be greatly appreciated.
That's exactly what I needed to get my learning path a little bit more structured. 
I really struggle to give an estimate of my skills to land internship/junior position. For example, what should I know and be able to do in SQL to be junior data analyst? I have learned how to use joins, subqueries, CASE and other basics but I don't know is that enough for entry position and I should focus on some other skills. I would be really pleased if someone can advise on this :)
haha this thumbnail nails the learning process
Damn it's been almost 3 years since I came across your channel ! I am so excited for you to impact even more people üåª (and strangle Ecstasy in Jiujitsu he'd like it)
Hi I wanted to ask can people with bachelors in Art degree learn data sciences and actually succeed in the field?
Can you make a video on the best resources to use for beginners in python that are trying to make their way into data science? This would be very helpful to many I'm sure
I am not ben, u fakka
Okay
My college has a Lab that I joined and that got me into an amazin internship where I am able to be both a data scientist and a data engineer in order to better grasp my interests as well as getting paid very well. I was very unsure of my future until about 3 months ago so keep going guys, the harder you work the more luck will come your way
As a senior college student do you think a masters is valuable to land a job in data science? At least my plan is to fo a masters in a specific domain or an area of Data Science like Machine Learning (since my major is Data Science). Ive seen many opinions on the topic but i would like to know you view on the subject. Btw thank you for your videos, they were what inspired me to pursue Data Science!!
Thank you Ken for the content and discount code.
Does 365 datascience help in placements?
I'm currently at mistake 4. I'm using resources to further my skills and touch up on my learning, but haven't the slightest clue on where to begin with a project. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
great video.
Do you think chat gpt will take over this field?
BRO HOW DO YOU WANT TO CREATE CHATGTP ARE YOU RICH?
Another Ben here üôãüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. However, I‚Äôm glad I caught this video within three weeks of my journey.
I used to love your videos when you started out. However, it seems like you have run out of topics to make videos on lately.
Love the mo Ken! You should keep it!! Oh sorry I meant Ben üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Love this! So helpful
this video came to me on the perfect time i felt  won't give up data science #manifestingdatasciencegoals
Thanks Ken Jee! You inspired me to start my data science youtube channel. It would be a dream to collaborate with you sometime !
I have failed quite a lot of interviews and therefore would like to look back to see what was wrong as well as to find fresh motivation in the new year. Thanks a lot Ken and Ben!
When it comes to data science is there a specific language that it‚Äôs taught in?
I started watching Ken‚Äôs videos roughly 2.5 years ago while I was still working retail. Now, I am a Senior Data Analyst working for a large energy company making 6 figures annually. Thanks Ken!

I forgot to mention, I participated in Ken‚Äôs first 66 Days of Data challenge too!
I'd highly appreciate if we could make a community for sports analytics and share our insightsüòä especially for beginners
Sir I don't have a degree can I get a job in data science??
Upper management never trusts data science
I am 35 years old...its to late to learn data sience with no experience..
Hi! Thanks for the video. I‚Äôve also been pretty stuck in my progress at landing a Data Science job. It‚Äôs hard trying to work on projects while also taking rigorous classes at school. However I am planning on working on a Data Science project about poker analysis and creating a poker bot with neural networks if anyone is interested in working together!
Hello everyone, I‚Äôm starting out and just learning data science and analysis. By the end of the year I really hope to learn a lot and hopefully land a job in a space or car related industry.
Thank youu
i love the video, i think it is  a unusual video because the  most youtubers make videos where  they explain  them  would learn in the currently year, abd you give us advices to avoid the wrong ways to study in this field,   thanks for the video
How did you go about learning data science specifically for sports? It‚Äôs a field I‚Äôm interested in too
Ben you and I will both get that Data Science role this year! Let‚Äôs get it
i want work in datan science, i am from panama but i dont work yet in that field
Ben for life
Thank you!
What do you think about the "365 Data Science" program? Can you make a review about them???
Can data science help in sports prediction?
Hey Guys, data analyst here trying to break into data science. lets connect!
What if my goal is to become a pseudo data scientist just to sell paid courses by being a youtuber?
Hii ken jee, can you please share your thoughts for learning data analytics.. if possible. Plzzzz
I‚Äôve got #6 down solid!  üòÇ  I hate asking for help anyway.  Even on StackOverflow, I find answering questions an extremely good learning experience, but have not asked one question yet.  
I have difficulty with number #1 because my goal keeps changing.  I keep finding more things to study.  
So my new year‚Äôs resolution is to stop changing my goals, finish my projects, and find a job with my current skills this year!
I‚Äôm Ben I need to complete a full curriculum üò£
Sir, Can a person with career gap of 4 years enter into this field and get a good job?
Love the video!
So much emote material, omg KEN I need those Ben faces üòÇ
Great video Ken. Thank you! I do have a question. At the 3:29 minute mark, you mentioned about cluster analysis technique being used in the food industry. Is there some sort of a reference article that lists all the different techniques and the domains that they are heavily used in ? Thanks
2022 was full of traps... Thanks for the points Ken. It will help me to plan 2023 better. 

BEN is looking like David Warner.üòÇ
Didn't want to watch the video,but I'm glad I did, thanks Ken for the advice, I've self reflected and pointed out the mistakes I made in my data journey, this video has proved the solutions, hopefully I use at least 70% of the advice given. By the way my goal is to get a job in marketing analytics this year !
With the amount of resources and roadmaps available online , I am genuinely and scaringly overwhelmed and unable to lay out what should I read this year to deepen my knowledge
I‚Äôm also Ben
Cute project. I think it is great name for cat =)
Towards the end of last year I decided to make the switch from education to data analysis. It‚Äôs been a grind along with life coming in the way, my studying has staggered. 

I‚Äôd say my goals for this year is to finish my certification and land a job as an entry level business/data analyst job. I‚Äôm still going over materials and have to admit, I‚Äôm nervous to start my own project. Since I‚Äôm not sure what to do or how long it‚Äôll take me.
No way to find jop in data science  Ken
As someone who has completed 100% of every Udemy course I started, I'll also advise to not fret about taking multiple courses on the same subject. Many topics, such as statistics, can be taught in half a dozen different ways, and the way they're taught in a new course could convey valuable insight missing from old ones. However, also do not make the same mistake I made and just take course after course (i.e., tutorial hell) because AI/ML/DS subjects run deep, and you can keep going down rabbit holes for the next ten years and still never learn everything there is to know.
This was a great video. I've been putting together a plan for 2023 data science learning to expand my existing skill set, and this was very helpful.
Did you find the Golden Key Society beneficial in anyway?
I've been learning python for the past month now and I made some decent progress. I've started to exprole some of areas that python is able to used in. I originally started off my python learning journey to become a software developer but I recently became more interested in data science. My current goals are to get comfortable with python, SQL, and to build my own website/portfolio with django. 

I recently found your channel and I can see myself being a frequent viewer from now on, keep up the great content!
I've just recently discovered my passion for data science as an economics graduate. While my statistics and math bases are pretty solid Im totally lacking on the technical part (just started to learn Python). 
I discovered your channel not long ago and Its absolutely amazing how much your videos helped me finding motivation and guidance through this difficult journey. 
My aspiration is to become a data scientist, I know it's a long path, but your experience and advices never fail to give me the confidence I need.
Thank you for everything you're doing man, I greatly appreciate that as a senior data scientist you spend your time and effort to help newcomers like me. Keep it up bro, you're doing a great job ‚ù§Ô∏è
The one thing Ben shouldn‚Äôt change‚Ä¶ his mustache ü•∏üëå
Thanks Ken for the advice. I have learnt so much from your videos. I stopped for sometime. However, i have a goal this year to finish more than 5 projects if possible. 
Does anyone here works as a Data scientist in real estate industry? I need some help
I spent all of 2022 trying to get a job as a data analyst or scientist (despite having qualified experience, skills, etc.). At best, I improved my resume, got better at interviewing, learned skills, and earned a Microsoft certification. I am better prepared to continue trying in 2023.
hey Ken! is there a big gap in skill and difficulty between entry data analyst jobs and more advanced positions like data scientist?
This is a really informative and entertaining format, love it. Thanks for the video Ken! My goals are now to figure out my niche, build some projects and start applying for roles
Get a Job!
Great advice! Happy New Year!!
Much needed video :) Thanks endlessly
much needed :)
Goals for this year are to get hired as a data analyst, get experience, and begin the process of transitioning into data science.
Brief:
1. Don't Start at the beginning
2. Don't go in without a plan
3. Don't let perfect be the enemy of great
4. Don't get stuck in tutorial hell
5. Don't keep your work to yourself
6. Don't ask for help
7. Don't give up
My goal is to land a sports quant role! Need to improve my R skills, and more importantly, brush up on statistics knowledge.
A whole lot of noise in the data community.
Everyone thinks they have learnt enough to start sharing roadmap.
So sad.
sussy baka
My goal for this year is to land a junior data/business analyst role.
it's so rare to have wisdom shared and so underrated. We really should appreciate more of the mistake's and realized we could learn a lot from it. Learn from it to prevent these mistakes from happening of course.
hey ken do you think that taking courses on how to do projects is beneficial? because I'm in my first steps in learn data science and I don't have a clear vision on how to do projects.
Please make a vidoe on how much math is needed for someone to call themself a "Data Scientist" without feeling like a clown. Thanks
I like how ken updates his learning roadmap each year
I‚Äôm Ben everybody!!
Excellent Advice Ken!
Give Ben some extra motivation by sharing your learning goals for the year below!

Had to eat my way through Spain....

Dish at 0:45 is from Georgia :)
Food looks good
Spain is a gorgeous country. That even looks awesome.
A data science hackathon? What a wonderful idea!

However, as someone who has participated in 12-hour, 24-hour and 48-hour hackathons ... nope, not even if I ever qualify! Never again!! There just isn't enough aspirin in the world.
Wow, what a nice event, thank you for sharing!
Hi everyone,
I have a weird background to get into datascience and just wondering on everyone's advice on what program would be best suitable to get into data science.
I have a double bachelors in neuroscience and psychology with a specialisation in statistics and a minor in AI and data science.
This year I'm on exchange to study mathematics, logic/descrete math, and data visualisation.
I am good at R and okay at python.
My options for the master are: Artificial Intelligence (very heavy math focused having to prove most models by hand), Statistics & data science (math & R, little bit of python and SQL), or data science (focused on Python, bit SQL, tiny bit R, no math).
What would be best to get into the field of data science or machine learning engineering. I really like statistics and machine learning.
I'm afraid if I go for just the data science one it could be just a hype diploma but it's the most applied to work in the field, the others are more theoretical but therefore more future proof. Does this even matter after you get your first jobs? Would bootcamps be better for one or the other? any pros or cons?
Thank you everyone for your time/reading
Best
Super cool event. Thanks for sharing! : )
This looks so epic omg, loved the video and seeing part of the event
Great video Ken! I do hope we'll meet not only on the next edition of Championships but on many other Kaggle Days activities! You brought so much positive energy to the event and you will always be most welcome!
And LOL - you recorded my tattoo - so cool! üòç
This looked sick! üôåüèº Jealous you got to go to this!
Your coverage was awesome üôåüôå.

Was Keith Gallie an attendee, I would like to see his coverage also.
The most cliche starting of a video üòÇ
Great coverage of the event and looking forward to when your talk comes out üòä
What a cool event! It was nice of you to forgo the competition to avoid showing everyone up.
Ah . . . brings back awesome memories! üôÇ
What an awesome video! Travel Vlog meets Data Science! üéâ Awesome stuff, Ken!
Remember, you can use you.com's search completely free! If you check them out, be sure to use my link, it really helps me out! you.com/kenjee
super helpful!
Dude legit looked like Elon from certain angles..
Thanks Ken, big fan!
Nice video, you summarize in a clear and simple way all the relevant concepts!
print (" Papaya ")
Great video can you provide more videos on data science projects.
3:06 why add the else print statement? Don‚Äôt teach beginners to do this, it‚Äôs terrible code lol. There are other ways to showcase how to do if-else statements properly.
Wonderful and Value adding video...Just few suggestions...you can add some more light near to you cuz the lighting looks little dull and when you read the script from the screen infront of you....your voice becoming monotonous and lacking smile....maybe you can add highs and lows in your voice and smile in between. Because even though the information is good, when viewing experience lacks the viewer won't feel excited.....Just wanted to tell how i felt..cheers Ken
Great video Ken! I need your camera üò¢
Also an important skill related to coding- Relearning English. Learning how to articulate what your potential solution would look like in great detail can save a lot of time when building APIs/internal tools. I've found that if I jump in without taking any time to express my system, I end up with code that needs to be rewritten a lot
Happy to see that Ken is a cultured man that use scikit, instead of trying to be one of those Twitter edge-lords
Hey ken I'm looking for your video with an interview of a company that helps you get a data job for a percentage of your salary. I think it was your channel i watched it on. can you tell me the name if it was you
Is this everything? It doesn't like a lot. I already know the pyrhon concepts you talked about. I guess all i need to know are the libraries
Dang it ... I now want muffins.
09:40 #Facts üôåüèº Ya gotta get good at the googles!
You said it all, Data scientist have a lot to learn.
Knowing your limit in python programming is great.
Can I have a muffin too pls? ü•∫
Very useful guide for someone who is just starting out as these are the concepts which we mainly use on getting our tasks done as a beginner. I remember trying to learn everything possible a few years ago and it was extremely overwhelming.ü§£
This is a nice reminder that I don't need to learn EVERTHING there is to know to be a good data scientist. It assuages my anxiety lol.
Babe wake up. New Ken Jee video just dropped.
When watching this through, I realized I misspoke about classes and objects! At 10:15 I say that libraries are made up of a group of objects. Technically, they are made up of classes. When we implement the libraries, we use the classes to create objects. This article explains this concept in more detail: https://www.scaler.com/topics/difference-between-class-and-object/
Imagine missing the hot tub stream ü•∫
How much and which kind of math & statistics we need to be in ai/ml/data science
Yes!! Please algorithm gods, push this type of content over garbage like hype house. In an alternate universe Vinnie Hacker is an actual hacker
Sorry, but I miss when these videos were about a great data scientist sharing knowledge rather than trying to be a comedian
Inspiring! I have learnt alot from you guys.
Amazing üß®
Thu Vu is missing
We need more women content creators! üò∂‚Äçüå´ Inspiring to see all of you in one place üôÇ
could you make a video of, when we could consider ourselves a data scientist? That is, what kind of skills should I have to be able to work without problems? for people like me that are learning from the internet is hard to tell if i need to learn more or im ready to start.
What the starmer doin
where's the link to full video?
Who clean the data here I mean the houseüòÇüòÇ
This honestly feelt as exciting as marvel multiverse
Words can't even begin to describe how transformational this trip was for me! It was so amazing meeting all of you in Utah and shoutout to Bright Data for sponsoring!
This seems fun, looking forward to see upcoming videos. 
I think old videos  such as 
1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpIFS6jZbe8
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM1eE_Coh6g&list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek
and so on.  

Please  make more  videos in old topics again. There very interesting to see and understand about DS.
Ah I'm not jealous at all :3 I'm really glad you guys had fun and were there for each other at times when some needed support üåª
Inspiring!
I am loving this.
Seeing people who have modded life's positively coming together for good üñ§üñ§
This seems so fun
I'm glad I stumbled onto this video.... I'm a software engineer, currently working with Java and its frameworks. I've always been interested in data, but I'm not very sure about the best path into the field, plus work takes a lot of my time. I'd be happy to try any advice anyone here might have for me.
Guys, if I in near future would want to do an internship under you, how can i do so?
I loved hanging out with y‚Äôall‚Äôs! I feeel so energized everytime we‚Äôre all together üíñ
My sushi üç£ üç± shots made it in! üòÇ Go iPhone 13!
Damn. Iron analyst sounds like a good time
Dude, so fun getting to meet all my favorite data nerds IRL! üôåüèº Thanks for putting this together, Ken!
Hot tube üòè ay dios!
Cool üî•
Good content ken jee, thanks pal.
It was an awesome time to get meet everyone and create content! 10/10 would do again :D
WHAT A CREW! What a party! Miss y‚Äôall

dont do data science its very bad field
Hello Mr.Ken ,Sir currently im pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Application and along with that im also learning Data Science as well. Im in love with Day Trading and im a day trader as well ,so i was wondering is it possible to merge both Trading and Data Science field..... Moreover is it possible to get a Data Science job as a fresher.

Sir as you are a Data Science Veteran , i would like to seek ur view and guidance related to this...‚ù§
Can ai take data science job in future?
Ken me the roadmap non IT Background  to IT background switch what is roadmap for those because i am fresher graduated.
Hey do you think that an exit to consulting is also possible? Because I think Data Science skills are very valuable there.
6:15 , in many Asian companies, the role of a Data Scientist is often perceived as being akin to that of a subordinate, 
where bosses tend to offer minimal compensation (represented by a few gold coins) while expecting an extraordinary level of work commitment similar to that of a superhuman.
learning new things everyday ! maybe no , but once a week maybe yes :D
Great info overall.. awesome. What‚Äôs ur kaggle account? 
Thank you for putting out balanced take on being data scientist!!
Would you be able to learn the new skills during work hours, or would you have to learn them on your own?
is a BS in Data Science worth it?
Thanks for this, I'm a technical product owner and do a fair amount of business analysis in my role so I'm learning to move into data science in the next couple of years. I didn't know I wanted to be taking my career this direction until I took this current role and learned SQL and Python. I'm a bit overwhelmed by the amount of what I need to learn but I just keep working to make progress each day.
I'm just discovering your channel, and I can see how on top of replies you are - big props btw - so I have a question: I think I'm coming at DS backwards from most people. I'm very interested and inspired by research around the areas of Bayesian dynamics, self organised criticality and emergent control systems - that kind of thing, as it applies to intelligence. Do you see the industry, or a subset of it, leveraging any of these kinds of ideas from the "quantitative life sciences" broadly, as opposed to say _just_ neural networks/Bayesian statistics/etc. in particular? Or, at least do you see a problem or class of problems in industry that seems to demand more exotic methods, like the aforementioned?

I'd like to try work on a project, but I can't think of anything very interesting. ChatGPT reccomended I do something that can measure the phase changes of a distributed neural network, which sounds awesome, but I don't know how industry would care about something like that, aside from a rather uninspiring "making DNNs more efficient". Thanks in advance.
For me it's leverage, I think that's most important. I need to be irreplaceable, such that people who mistreat me have that sword of Damocles hanging over them always - that being the implicit threat of me going somewhere else. I hope I could obtain leverage through novelty, which I guess counts as a value, but it's anscilliary to leverage in some part. As it pertains to DS, I'm most excited by novelty through methods, rather than 'just being really good with SQL' or something. I know it's an undervalued essential, but this whole prompt is a pipe-dream so...
so what's the best programming/software engineering career path to maximize income?
Doing a conversion degree in data & artificial intelligence at the university of Liverpool next year. Excited about this career path!
How long take learning phase of data science? Which are the best ways to practice DS before able to get a job ?
I am HR and 38 years old can I do career switch?
Is it possibile to work as a part-time data scientist?
Data engineer seems like a better career to me tbh :)
this guy is goated
Hey Ken, your videos are always so elaborate & nuanced. Thanks for putting out such quality content.
Can someone from physics background become a data scientist?
Im a senior in college interested in the data science career. I was pretty dead set on working as a management consultant at an MBB coming out of undergrad but I keep hearing similar stories to your own. That the wlb is absolutely garbage in comparison to tech. My major is more management heavy but also have MIS as a minor, have a high gpa(3.5+), have a decent amount of coding experience, and I‚Äôm completing the IBM professional data science career cert. Is there anything else I could be doing to better my chances other than doing my own projects and uploading them to github?
Just like software engineering, lots of people join the data scientist field, attracted to the high wages, but become disenchanted that something like 80-90%+ of the work is definitely NOT sexy nor straightforward. There is a high learning curve that filters out many people from ever reaching senior level. This is why junior levels roles are saturated but senior level roles have had continuous shortages.
I Ken I became a supply chain analyst, so I collect data from expeditions (fill rates, inventory, which costs/business expenses are associated to outbound logistics). 
Not really a data scientist nor a data analyst but still using powerbi and excel.
The weirdest thing is that here in my country logisticians (truck drivers, truck lift drivers, freight brokers, back office, warehouse workers) are way more requested) than IT/data driven roles. It‚Äôs surely based on the region/district.
Thanks for this summary !
I think becoming a data scientist and then quitting to make videos online is a good career ü´£
Thanks so much Sir for that lovely information. Please, I have a question. What is the job description of that Medical Doctor who understands data science and machine learning as well as software engineering better than the medical practitioners and also understands Medical practice better than the data scientist/machine learning engineer and software engineers?
data science is boring
What do you recommend for someone looking to get into this field with no formal education (college degree of any type) but doesn't have the time or money to return to school
I'm a part of an 'AutoML' research group and I just wanna say this: AutoML isn't coming anytime soon üòÖ
I like to ignore most of the media hype. They're written by journos who fall for tech hype or random gurus on LinkedIn/Twitter who have never actually done hardcore data worl
What is most important to me in a career is engaging work, and good work life balance.  If the work isn't engaging then I don't have much desire for it.  If the work is to much, or takes me away from my family to much I don't have much desire for it.
Data Science is an unproven career. The vast majority of businesses will never hire one, and the ones that do will probably hire an outside vendor.
Another banger for us data nerds. Thanks Ken!
I can't wait to get out of this field, personally.
I'm an econ student interested in finance and I was wondering if data science was a good skill to learn. Bit the hullet and used your code for 365! Heres to learning
Just subscribed to 365DataScience and now YT now suggests your channel. Big Brother is watching ü§£
Data engineer incoming üòÄ
bro honestly u have an inbuilt gene of content creation.
As an engineer and computer scientist, using data science has done wonders for my job because I am in specific field. Going for DS only without any biz expertise is a fools errand. My best promotions were due to aligning my expertise, DS, and company/management goals or showing them gaps.
Guys, I am coming from a career transition. Backgroud of Engineer to data science, I got my first job last year but unfortunately the scenario changed and me and other data scientists were fired. 
I'm looking for any advise... I also was looking for a mentor, anybody know a way to find one? It would be amazing having some expert in the area as a mentor. 

Thank you
This has been relayed really well..! üòÄ As a fellow data scientist, I definitely relate to these. üëç
Great to see new video from you, Ken! Very good points on data science career! Data scientist can't be the only sexy job out there üßêüòÑ
Great video Ken. Could you please make a similar video on MLOps job prospects and demand?
Great points ! 
Bro how to gain experience other than traditional ways & could u suggest some books to tackle my inexperience in selling service online to get initial clients faster also some best read for online money making for service based autocad design engineer, consultants who sell services by creating engineering designs..
Nice video Ken! What are your thoughts on freelancing as a data scientist?
2012: Data Science is the most sexist job.
2022: Is Data Science a good career choice.

This is what happens when things get over hyped.
Everyone wants to do data science but not ready to know what it actually entails.
@5:03 LOL legit, I've been considering paying for the o'reilly subscription so I have access to all their books!
I'm pretty sure you're what's keeping data science sexy. Keep up the good work, Ken.
Thanks please suggest to do internship in data science
Great video! Keep the hard work
Good to see you back Ken - great video as usual and completely agree with everything you covered. 
In my new data science role, I've been finding that I've had to learn a lot about Data Engineering and the entire pipeline instead of just focusing on the modelling + stakeholder management aspect.
Switched track from my food science bachelors and working on my data science masters now. Found out this is really what I want to do after I worked with food data on one of my food science internships, and haven‚Äôt given up since.
Is Data Science a good career?? Maybe... 
BUT is Data Analytics a BETTER career!?!? Heck Yeah!!! 
üòújk üòò
Impressive ‚ú®
Hi Ken!
In your opinion, would obtaining Google data analytics professional certificate, CompTIA Data+ certificate and IBM data analytics professional certificate be enough to land me a entry level job of a data analyst?
Thanks!
EDIT: If anyone else would like to give me an advice, please do.
As a data scientist, I can attest this is quality advice. 

Regarding the ‚ÄúAutoML is gonna take our jurbs!‚Äù - I‚Äôve heard a lot of that regarding large language models that can now write code. Im personally not worried - humans bring information sets that are virtually never in existing text. It‚Äôs about the very broad context, which is real hard for a model to factor in. 

And lol yea, politics is the worst.. learned that the hard way.
Just wanted to point out that becoming a data scientist should not be the end-all-be-all for someone that pursues a career in data.  I was a BI analyst, took a bootcamp for data science, got a job as a data analyst and then eventually moved to a Data Engineering role.  But as a data engineer, I get to run all sorts of ad-hoc analysis, utilize machine learning and presenting my findings.  I absolutely love my role because I get to work between building out our data pipelines while also spending time in the trenches to get to know the data.  There is a lot of options out there for everyone and you might find you like an ancillary role more than a data scientist role!
Your video frequency has dropped drastically, I learnt a lot from you Ken Jee, thanks for your content, please make more content frequently.
Big brain idea
This is awesome !!
The title will "the papaya master viz"
It's a good idea üòÇ i find it interesting, to see the jobs posting and make a viz. üòè
Love this !!
This is going to be FUN to watch
Give us the dataset so that we can do a little bit of cleansing üòä
DUDE! I got to get in this next one!!!
Oooooooh yes!
hahaha this is so sick

Why is Alex so mad??
Self. supplied. snacks. at. every. meeting.üëèYassss!!
It's good to be honest in the work environment. We are all human beings. Not just Analyst or Scientist.
The made me laugh out loud
Quality content lads keep it up lmao
The crossover we all wanted ! The best data content creators in a single video !
"We are NOT friends....I HATE that guy, he is the WORST!"  --Me thinking ATA is the nicest guy on the planet 
Loved the video and love it when you guys put out the funny content!!
ü§£
This is revolutionary teaching style! We need more fun in education. Hope to see more of this. Keep up the good work @Ken and @Alex.üí™üíØ
Imagine not letting Ken in smh, also I heard the among us music at 00:31
Guys i am new to data science... i follow almost all of you on youtube... great videos ...great content... AND funny at the same time
Bro these are hilarious ü§£ü§£ü§£ I have never seen Alex mad before omg
üòÅ
Amazing video üòÇü§£üòÖ

This one is super funny!!! üòÑ Enjoyed watching it, Ken Jee. Awesome expressionsü§©
Keep them coming! We like it.
Hilarious üòÇ loved üòç it
Ken is the best actor aming them alll.....üôåüèª
I am the newest analyst on my team and this is definitely me.
üëçü§£
Ken was that a Larry David death stare-off I witnessed?üòÇ
BAM! So excited when Josh appeared üòÄ
This was hilarious!
I mean if I had to watch someone chose to type with only their index fingers‚Ä¶.
Man, is it just me or does anyone share with me the feeling that Ken is becoming our Filthyfrank of the Data Science/Analytics community. And I am loving it. 
Great video guys üëèüëç
LOL love this
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, Alex was forced to say ML is not involved.
Mechanical Keyboard! lets go!!!!
Who knew there was so much drama at the BrightData house!

"Hey, who ate my strawberries?"
Alex played his part so well!!! And Ken hammed it up at the perfect moments; great chemistry between frenemies
i'm gona sit next to you ,,, and then .... hahaha 

this is the motivation  for keep studying data science, keep making such content
hahaha im dead üíÄ

you guys should do more of these!
Alex needs to watch Ryan Hayashi on Fool us with Penn and Teller.  He said it best.  "No matter who you are, no matter how hard you work, or how good you think you are at what you do.  There will always be an asian to take it to the NEXT LEVEL! ü§£"
Ken, Zbooks are not strawberry juice proof. Please be careful! üòÇ
1:43 LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Wait was that Luke? lol
wow!! It was hilarious!!
The dataverse is real!‚Ä¶ And cringy
LOL so funny. If kids ask me what cartoon I watch and who are my favorite heroes, I'm gonna show you guys! 

Thanks :D
Best mum ? Luke üòÇ
Ken‚Äôs fruit work is breakthrough!
The keyboard got to me. Who brought a mechanical keyboard to this meet up.
This was hilarious! "The Office" material good. Have you all considered switching careers to acting?
This sounds so fun ! We get to see a more personal version of Ken and others when they're together ! Glad to see Tina and Luke around people like you at times like these as well, even tho only her keyboard made it Haha (jk)
Thank you for the amazing video Ken !
So awesome! BAM! :)
Bam! Great video!
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üìäüìäüìäü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
That blooper with Luke just kill me ü§£
Omg Alex Freberg is so good at expressions. As usual Ken just drives into the role quickly. Btw, thanks for the bloopers at the end. They are so funny. I think Ken is kinda competition for Joma at funny sketches.
Alex's wife is not gonna like thisü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇ
I've never seen Josh before but that BAM was so iconic üòÇ
Alex is DISTRAUGHT ü§£ü§£ü§£
üòÇüòÇ this was a lot of fun to make with you! This really explains why I‚Äôm a data analyst and not an actor üòÅ also my wife is hot
Love how this came together! The best scene was the various ways ken can eat a strawberry üòÇ
‚ÄúKinda just sounds like you don‚Äôt know how to do machine learning‚Äù üòÇ SAVAGE. Great work team.
So, every aspiring data science person turns to YT-blogger in order to make it? Am I studying DS in order to become a blogger? What's the dog's name in the video, he also deserves credit....
I think if we apply ml model and provide Alex and Ken data to it... It will get confused whether you both are friends or not üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hahaha this turned out great!
love Ken :D
I had not seen Statquest incarnate but that BAM made me realize that‚Äôs Josh Starmer. But it would have been fun if there was one dopey song from him. BTW, Nice timing on this one for me! Just starting my new job as a data scientist.
OMG Alex you're great in this!!  Also looked like this was filmed in a house trying to look like an office, right?  but awesome!  Kinda felt bad for Ken having to be a jerk lol
Ken Jee plays an amazing ass hole. That was unexpected. I actually wanted to deck him myself.
Luke playing Alex‚Äôs wife ü§£ü§£
Ken Freaking Jee üòÇüòÇ.
I lost it there.
You guys should consider data analysis movie to mimic what actually happens in the data job market
Nice to see you guys here.
I wish I could be a part of this amazing conversations one dayü§û
This is great üëç thanks ladies and gentlemen üòâappreciate you hosting this conversation üòÄ
Legendsüî•üî•üî•üî•üî• just need to add corey schafer
Imagine if all these legends started their own company
OMG my favorite people in one room!!!
Nice podcast and nice to see all popular and successful data professionals in the room. Also glad to see Keith Galli to be part of it. But with his body language, he was looking kind of shy or depressed over here. Maybe he was annoyed by someone in the room. Not sure or maybe I am wrongly interpreting.
Luke!!! üòäüòä
Tina @ 39:---,  this was me earlier today, after telling my friend about going to grad school (Yh, I got a fully funded scholarship üôÉ). That I wanted to be in the academics for a while. And he felt why not tech "again", all the effort invested in DS in the past couple of past months?! I said tech would be there, but different thing drives everyone. For me, this is what I want to do, but DS would always be there.
Sweet!!

I said to a friend last week, "if Thu was in America I'm sure she would find a spot here" üòÖ

Been busy these couple of days, but I'm glad I'm here now ü§ó
A great connect of the industry giants. Great to see the Seattle Data guy, Higuan and Keith Galli on the show. üî•
Wow this one was good! Thank you for always inspiring me to grind harder, whether at work or on YT. Cheers!
I am distracted by the üê∂ üòç
Thu Vu is my latest favourite :) Big props to the OGs Forrest Knight & Keith btw!
The most handsome data scientist / software engg  is hiding in corner "Forrest Knight" üòâ
Awsome  !!! nice to see great personalities of Data Science. under one roof. ( Missing  .. Aishwayra, Sundas and  Thu Vu ).
Poggers!
So excited to see Keith there ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è.
It a full house this Time around.
Crazy day, I just get to see this! I love this GANG!
Nice!!!!,  aleast Keith is in the House
There is no krish naik
Look at those nerds making us feel proud about our data jobs, what we do and how we live :)
All legends in one place
This is so cool üòé  wish the web developers youtube community were like this instead of being crabs ü¶Ä  in a bucket ü™£.
This is awesome, you guys are building generations to come. 
Impacting knowledge üñ§üñ§.
So cool seeing you guys alll together. Big fan from The Netherlands üá≥üá±. Keep it up guys love the content ü§ûüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
Loved it! And great inspiration as always too,  Keep up the good work!
It would be nice to have people from the business intelligence field too. Enjoyed the video.
oof I missed this :(, but who's stopping me to replay this lol
Thanks to each and everyone of you. I began my data journey roughly a year and a half ago and each one of you at some point has helped me in that journey. I will never forget when I emailed Alex the analyst regarding a dilemma I had in choosing a masters program he replied and helped me narrow down my decision.
Hi Ken, very insightful discussion from everyone.

Thanks for putting this together.

Avery is a cool dude but why is he spending more time on his phone.

please, can you add the links to everyone's socials.
No Shashank Kalanithi, no party
Very cool town hall.

Some constructive criticism would be to maybe avoid looking at your phone while another member is sharing his/her thoughts. It felt like you guys were not integrated with each other,  plus it comes off as a bit rude.

Other than that, you guys are awesome!
This is good stuff! The Data All-Stars! Looking forward to see Shashank Kalanithi and Luke Barousse here tomorrow!
All Data Legends in One Frame... ‚ô•Ô∏èüòç goosebumps... üî•ü§©
Iam starting my course of data science from this year
Plz congrats me üòÅ
These guys are the justice league of data analytics/ data science. I became a data analyst watching Ken, Tina, Alex and Luke. Such a great inspiration! Thanks for the great content
Thanks for the deep note info
ŸÖŸÜŸàÿ± Ÿäÿß ÿßŸÑŸäŸÉÿ≥ üòÑ that's hi Alex in Arabic
Thank you for bringing all these legends together and creating a great content  for usüëè
This was so very cool, would love to hear more in this format
Thank you all for the awesome live.
Great live! Thank you! Waiting on the links for each participant, if that is still possible :)
Stone Cold Steve Austin is a Data Analyst/Scientist too? Damn !!!
Nice to see PyCharm represented. It does indeed get a bad rap for the slow indexing, but that aside, it supports a ton of functionality that I can‚Äôt live without these days. Maybe I‚Äôm just stubborn.. but I‚Äôm still team PyCharm.

Also, this was a cool video idea - interesting hearing a collection of in-the-field data scientists and engineers.
To get things started, I would like to do a python project where I automate the watering of my plants! Share the projects you would like to work on below!  Again, thanks for watching! Be sure to check out all the resources in the description above!
Copying and pasting codes and executing it is a very unique way to learn, currently im doing data science Professional course on Coursera by IBM and they used this technique in Jupyter Notebooks.
So basically
Datatypes
Variables work
Logical operators if else elif
Loops while and for
Functions encapsulate and reuseability
Basic data structures work tuples dictionary set list
Then libraries , pandas, numpy matplotlib, scikit learn
Arrays, series, dataframe from numpy
Classes and object oriented programming is for later
And build projects to renforce learnings, 
Also just follow projects on kaggle line by line don't worry about feeling less of and just learn how the project is build.
And take it easy on yourself
Well, I have to admit that this is the best video to lead you on the programming path! Thanks Ken!
This was excellent Ken, thank you!
Excellent video Ken!!!! I love the quality of your videos. Keep up the great work :D
Interesting, keep it up
Thank you for the fantastic and simple explanation
IDLE IN 2023, ANYONE?
Though R is _technically_ a programming language, I think very few people use it for programming. And that's almost ditto for Python, ime. I just think that if you're in a bit of a pinch, actually solving a problem by programming just makes your life so much easier, and I think Python tends to get you to the program you want to write much easier, mainly because it's C-like.
Hey Ken great video as always man. Can I ask what are those boards at 2:51 they are awesome!
great work Ken Jee
Love the jiu jitsu visual analogy to when you feel stuck debugging a coding problem. Have no fear cause likely a developer on stackoverflow has experienced the same problem and solved it. Thank you my man!
You are a godsent. I am 31 who wants to go into tech by doing data scientist bootcamp. Are companies still looking for entry level data scientist jobs? Or should i pick up another skill aside from the basics before applying left and right?
you were super helpful when i emailed you about a year ago just so others know but please don't blow up his inbox lol. anytime a market becomes bloated or saturated you need a remedy its nature i believe. with data science and analytics courses even masters degree being handed out by the dozen, what do you think is the future of DS analytics this whole industry that relies on experts that transform data into insights. What will happen in the next 3-5 years from your standpoint (you're def an expert in area if not one of the top, def up there and you're always objective, only giving more credibility to your opinions). thanks Ken.
I can attempt to take you on in a cook-off but not in Jiu Jitsu üåª
Great video Ken ! Thank you
Thanks so much for this video. The link to the youtube for freecodecamp isn't working. I had a question (perhaps for another video)‚Äî what "certifications" (if any) are valuable in the DS space?
This video is amazing. Thanks for sharing your wisdom. 
What I would love to make with python is an automated speed test for my internet that collect band width data every certain amount of time to make a dataset to present a claim to my internet provaider.
I train jiu jitsu as well. Blue belt here! Learning Data Science as I found a passion in working with data. If you're ever in Michigan please let me know and come train with us at our gym! I would like to eventually find ways to use data science to come up with interesting projects within the jiu jitsu landscape.
I was about to make a similar video and watching this inspired me plenty of new ideas, now I have to rewrite my entire script so thanks for nothing. Jokes aside, great video and inspiring as always!
I started doing some EDA on data from my workouts acquired from my Apple Watch, but I‚Äôm unsure where to go from here. Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance!
A video many have been waiting for!

A Ken Jee classic! I agree that at first, coding "seems" hard and challenging.

Once you get started with your first project, you begin to realize how much fun it is! A few well documented personal projects later, you're well on your way to potentially apply for entry level jobs.

Keep grinding everyone!
This is awesome! I'm in my first semester of master's program in Data Science, but I was having a hard time since I come from linguistics background. Now I feel like some clouds have been cleared up. Thank you so much for the video and can't wait to watch your next content! Cheers :)
Java? Interesting
I recently just tried Spyder IDE and reminds me of a lot of R. If your an R enthusiast trying to pick up python , I recommend giving Spyder a try !
Thanks for the info dude! Just FYI your LEDs are causing that banding. The frequency of the pulse width modulation is lining up with your shutter speed/ frame rate, if you change your shutter speed a bit you could get it to go away (wouldn't be using 180 degree rule anymore but who cares).
Thanks for the video!
What are your thoughts regarding the math of data science?
wow this was very informative! love the Jujutsu training clips! :)
Love this advice, also @Ken Jee your Gis in the video are super dope!
This came in right in time.
I am about to resume school in a month.
I have been planning to teach my course mates Data Science.
I often notice myself skipping some basics and hopping onto more advanced models and techniques. However, as elementary, as they may appear at first,¬†coding basics always need to come first. The more you know them, the easier it‚Äôll be to¬†grasp more complex structures.
That face when you're rolling...üòÖ...it was at this moment Ken realized he fricked up.
Thanks for watching everyone! Sorry for the bit of audio echo, getting used to the acoustics of the new office! Learn more about the Z by HP Data Science Stack Manager Here: https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/
Nice intro
Can I do a project about the ocean data science project
Advert, sponsorship, advert, sponsorship, advert. Good luck.
what a gift you are!
Bro no offense but you picked mind numbingly boring data picks. Like dude do you want people to not get in the trade hahahaha
I recommend data scientists go after modeling like linear regression models in sports. Its really fun and sports tends to be more fun than the titanic lol
Ya um no never work for free. We tried the work for free thing before it was called slavery. F that
Should you post your projects in github?
Thank you very much. Just the ispiration that I needed üòÉ
Hi. I am still a beginner in data science and right now, I feel overwhelmed with the variety of data that I can use for self-studying. To be honest, I don't know where to start if I am going to use data sets about finance or others. Should I try the ones listed in the video? Thanks
Thank you very much for the video!!!
So last week I found out I had notifications disabled when someone mentioned me on LinkedIn! Then the the other day I found out my Twitter DMs are locked? And literally just as I‚Äôm about to tuck in for the night I found out there‚Äôs a bunch of vid mentions I missed‚Ä¶including this one ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ahhh my bad, hope you‚Äôre doing AMAZING Ken!!! Love ya work!!!
I just found you, I have seen a couple videos of yours and I am amazed with your content. Thanks for sharing!
Hey ken jee 
Some with an accounting degree wishing to transition to data science can I do a postgraduate diploma in Cs will it count as a masters ?
Great content as always! I hope to help more people one day by having a wider reach like you, so your content motivates me a lot. Can't wait for your future content!
Hey ken Jee 
Instead of masters in data science can I use an alternative and do a micro masters ??
I got DALL-E access this morning!
Do people go through a phase while learning Data Science that no i can't do it at all? :( Going through the phase when i have started working on my projects.:(
Who could have articulated it any better ? It is clear and transparent glass now,in my mind.Thank you #respect
The opener killed me
Hello Ken, first thanks for the video!
I have some question: I‚Äôm starting to learn about data science and I realize how many thing need to learn. By creating projects it‚Äôs all about collecting data, clean data, structured data, test the data and improve?

Also,  having some projects and knowledge can help get an apprenticeship from different companies.
Awesome Video Ken. Thanks for the inspiration. I'm following you for quite a while now and learned some great skills through your videos. :) Have a nice day!
Excellent, thanks.
Thanks for the great video!
Could you make a video about Sports Analytics/Football Analytics Portfolio!
This I needed! I've got projects including your YouTube dataset, but only one or two have stood out with a few recruiters, so now I'm on the hunt to really stand out. Thank you again for this üôè
Hey ken I love your videos 
What is the advice you will give to someone with a non tech background like bSc accounting 
Like after completing data science online course is there need for a masters in data science or masters in computer science to make my scope broader
Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector
Solid advice. Especially investing in open source software. You can learn top tier software dev skills, gain excellent connections and add some big name contributions to your experience. The few times I've seen "contributor to PyTorch/scikit-learn/pandas" on a resume, I've been quick to insist on an interview.
That intro was epic üòÇ

Great tips for those looking to break into data!

Following Ken's tips in 2020 of learning by doing through projects is 100% of the reason I was able to land a job in the field!

If you're trying to obtain your first data job my advice is projects project projects!
Thanks Ken for another great vid , I am  still in need of the advice.. as a huge sports fan and finding out that data science can be used in sport as sport analytics has been a great delight. .. please what advice can you give a beginner in data science that wishes to go on the sports analytics path ???
Great video! Out of curiosity, how do you differentiate between novelty and creativity?
Soooo‚Ä¶ any ways to make common projects stand out? My portfolio has one great one and one common one and I‚Äôm on the job hunt. TYIA!
Thanks Ken.  I‚Äôm working on a project right now so this couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time.
I'm migrating from healthcare to Data analysis so I would like to make a portfolio using healthcare-related data. Any suggestion?
This is great.
Thank you for sharing üôå.
Great! Thank you for the insight. Just wanted to know will the data issues by US govt be any help to me if I am residing outside US?
Thanks!!! Great tips!!! üçªüçªüçª
Like always,info that must be taken in stride üôå‚ù§Ô∏è
Such great advice: Different is better than better!!

3:50 üòÇü§£ Next video: "Ken Jee analyzes his crime data"
What I recommend to people is to go up to local businesses around you and become an "unpaid intern" of sorts developing projects for them. You set your own schedule and etc (just as you would with a personal project). At the end of the experience you get to say you worked with someone (so you get work experience+ LinkedIn optimization). It also exposes you to a ton of perpectives in the real world and the projects can be fitted to yout needs.
Hey Ken. Sent you an email introducing you to the Beyond Coding podcast. Did you get it?
Thanks Ken, for sharing the resources and datasets.
Right Time!Thnx
Special thanks to SAS for having me out at the batting lab! Do you think I have what it takes to start my baseball career up again?
One of your best videos yet!  Data literacy is soo valuable and important.
What the heck this was so unexpected but awesome!  Felt like I was watching a professional documentary.  I wonder if data science could ever help me learn how to not look like a dork when I dance lol?  Probably not üòÇ
Thanks Ken for another great vid , I began data science after school as a way to break into the tech ecosystem, I am also a huge sports fan and founding out that data science can be used in sport as sport analytics has been a great delight. .. please what advice can you give a beginner in data science that wishes to go on the sports analytics path ???
Wow, haha, I had no idea that you were in the Cary area so recently! The RTP area is a pretty cool place. I love it here. Outside of getting a cool tour and experience at SAS, I hope you got to do and see some other fun stuff here! Great video as always. I really liked how this one was edited and shot.
The Lab looks like a fun project with an important cause. Great video!
hey Ken very cool video! Applied machine learning is severely lacking on YouTube and videos like this will hopefully promote that change!

 i just posted a video going over a free online analytics tool i made, could you check it out and give me any feedback?
Can machine learning Improve  sports betting analytics
What a swing and training montage!
Really cool video, interesting to see such a good real world application of Data Science in practice, would love to see more such kind of videos!‚ù£Ô∏èü§©
Whoa this is a sick video dude! Do more of these if you can.
This kind of video is very interesting üòÑ it's a great opportunity to see different data science applications for real-world problems
What an amazing lab... It will take sports to another level üôå
very cool!
Wow very interesting. Would be cool if could get a suggestion for specific kinds of swings someone might want ‚Äî or perhaps if could account for height / weight and length of arms / legs for whatever might help to optimize the swing. Totally guessing those would be relevant factors ‚Äî so whatever else shows up to personalize and add ability to select optimization. For example, power vs battery average etc. 

Something such as this for shooting a basketball? Some apps made for this but I imagine could be more done.
Loved this video! As a kid I had a former MLB player help me with my swing, just one session, and it improved my swing forever. Great to see that ML can have a role in this sort of development too.
What a great video and what seems like an amazing Lab. Data literacy at that age would've saved me years of soul searching üòÖ
ALAS IF ONLY YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL üòâ
0:05 I call it a cheap twerk!
Omg amazing video ! I agree this is a wonderful application of how data can help us better ourselves in any field. Loved the lifting and the meteorite bits Haha .. actually every part of the video ! Thanks for the huge efforts üåª
Also there's a very small podcast called Beyond Coding. They are exceptional however. I think you will really like their content
Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning have been very good for training sports oriented analysis. If you're interested I can share a few publications with you
Awesome video! I‚Äôd love to see them expand into improving pitching and fielding metrics using data and technology. Baseball and data, sounds like my dream job!
This felt like you were one of those reporters who go to different places and find out what they do - was like a News at 8 Special :D Loved it!
Ken Jee is gonna be called up to the major leagues after this one! üôåüèº‚öæ
Great video but I dislike the fact that the video never addresses comparative improvement in performance had there been no AI model to help. Like I understand AI helped kids be better, but I wanted to know how much these kids would have improved in absence of AI and just by sheer practice and conventional training. Simply put, this is a great problem to solve but can you quantitatively say that AI was needed?
Never thought SAS would have an amazing data-driven Batting Lab and it truly is a great way to both improve baseball and become aware of data science.
5:37 Haha, good one, almost thought you were going to pick up the front dumbbell
Would be cool if the pitcher could be a 3D hologram :)
Machine learning and sports is my dream couple!
I too noticed the Python code on the screen in the first bit of the video and then you go asking him the same exact question that I was wondering. Haha! Great video, anyway. üëçüèª
Allowing kids to interact with data in this ways, are the best.
No pressure casually enjoying the game and still learning.
Okay THAT is a seriously awesome real world application of data science. Love it!
Nice and refreshing video, felt like a short informative documentary made really well
I‚Äôm so jealous. Such a sick video! Did you used to play baseball? Because man, your swing is much better than I thought a golfer could do hahaüòÜ
Special thanks to Luke, Tina, and Miki! Check out Luke's video next! Check out Luke's Video Next: https://youtu.be/i8PKI_zJfDU
Working as Data Scientist and using ZBooks. You guys are soo realisticüòéüòéüòé
:D :D
When boys use overcomplicated tools to perform data science, the Gigachad uses excel.
This vid deserve millions of likes üôåüèªüôåüèª thanks for d content..  really enjoyed‚úåüèª
Why do i relate so much to Ken üò≥ü•∫
I would have such fun working with Luke and Ken in the same team lol they are hilarious but get it done!!!!
The collab we didn't deserve but got anyway:
LOL!
Very informative! You helped me find my passion with your videos and you inspired me to try to do the same for others by starting a Tech Youtube channel myself. So thank you for that!
Hi,
So I had a question.
So basically I'm going to college this year. I'm enrolled to get an online BSc degree in Data science program from an IIT. I'm also going for an undergraduate degree in computer science. What else should I try to do in this hectic schedule to get hired as a data scientist when I graduate?
The BEST comedy i've ever seen üòÖüòÖüòÖü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you guys, really creating this gang are awesome! Giving all this content by free... right now i am learning DATA CLEANING with Ken ! Luke always make me laugh... and Tina I LOVE TINA üòçüòçü§© Most clever girl i follow in YouTube
we need more like this too üòÇ
legend has it that we still haven't nailed that dance yet
üòÇüòÇüòÇ this was great, I definitely "evolved" from the excel/power bi user to Ken. I current work with a ton of software engineers, docker jokes made me lol
Neural networks on excel üòÖüòÇ
i bet i could build excel üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ i died haha
Loved seeing the other side of everyone in this video Ken!
What is your favorite tool as a Data Scientist though? ü§î
After watching this video, I really try to build Neural Networks in Excel ü§£
I love how ken is like pure data scientist!
Though I'm more like Luke everything need to be done in data in Excel üòÖ
This is masterpiece ü§£ü§£ü§£
I bet I could build AWS LMAO.
You can really see Ken's dedication to his viewers with how he grew a mustache just for the character he played in this video.
Hahahah
"And just like that.. I'm a data scientist" - this is so relatableü§£. Guys, this is so amazing, please do more of this!! Thanks so much Ken for sharing this! ü§©
You can't spell procrastinator without "TINA"
Let me slide into your team üòÖ
I'm definitely the kind that will build it from scratch and do it in C++
This is great. I am Tina 10000000 %
üòÇüòÇü§£
hahah this is great!!!
It became hilarious by every second.
"What? You don't write out your code before you implement it?" -Ken

This got me lol
I love the Excel programmer üòÇ
This was hilarious! Love to see some of my favorite Data folks in one video!
LOL this is spot on üòÇ I find myself being more like Ken's character wanting to build literally everything from scratch
I love the excel guy üòÇüòÇ
This is amazing ü§£
Tina is the exact opposite of what she portrait üòÇüòÇ
Sometimes I over complicate things also...wild thoughts
Great video and introduction to the types of data scientist!!! "What's a croissant distribution" got me goodüòÜ
Great video, hilarious! The Excel joke is out of this world, love it!
Okay but asking Tina to handle more than one social media app üíÄ
Anyway where's "The simpster?" ü•∫
Hahaha I love how the characters here are exactly the opposite from reality especially Tina üòÇ !
Also I bet you could build Excel if u wanted to Ken üòé
Hahaha I was cracking up all throughout the video -- great content! üíÄ
Waiting for ken to build excel !!
Why learn programming when you can learn DAX?
One of these days, Excel will be the top programming language!! üìäüôåüèºü§ì
My best programing language is also Excell üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I bet i could build tiktok" and those bloopers üòÇ so funny üëç
Sociopaths use VIM
Lol the bloopers! This made my day! You guys are awesome and funny!
Omg the outtakes are the best part üòÇ
‚ÄúI bet I could build Excel‚Äù ‚Äî Ken
This is so freaking funny üòÇ and so relatable
My favourite programming language is Excel,that really crack me up.ü§£
‚ÄúI bet I could build Excel‚Äù‚Ä¶ ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
That got me real good üéØ
I‚Äôm a data scientist ü§°

I love all of you guys‚ù§Ô∏è
You need Alex Freberg to crash the party.
Great livestream and congrats Ken on 200 K!
Data science all stars!!
That clickbait with TinaüòÄ
what a data squad !
Super cool, peeps!
This was such a fun livestream!! üôåüèº We gotta do this again ASAP!
This is literally big data. Iykyk.
Nice!!
This is so so nice, the community coming together, the help, just beautiful, this data community would last a life time.
Oh my god its like the avengers data science teem üôèüôÇüî• Well, I'm still at Junior data analyst. So can you consider me as a Spider-Man in your team The Avengers?
Happy Mother's day üåπüíê
I love this.
man i'm baffled with the level of questions in the chat.. seems like basic questions from people that haven't done their own research which have been asked many years ago and posted everywhere on the internet.. this is a gathering of people that are working or involved in the industry for a while and you ask them such basic questions?..   Ask more inspiring questions.. like how has the problems they've been asked to solve evolved from when they started to now? How have they evolved/leveled up in terms of their own problem solving skills..   What are the views of management on current data scientists.. which any views of fast up and coming analytics/ML/DL techniques (I'm aware these guys might not be plugged into current academic research..) they might not know this..  these are really things people should be asking.. as we get a glimpse if DS jobs are moving towards in the future (good/bad)..
I would take all the courses If TINA would come up with them üòõ
I slept through this :(
Thanks for the Town Hall, everyone! Really enjoyed learning more about you all personally and professionally. I had a couple more lingering questions if you can select one to respond to or both, I would appreciate it:

1- Do you think Microsoft Azure certificates are worthwhile when it comes to job search? 

2- What do you think are some strong non-traditional master's degree areas that you see breaking into data science? I'm not talking about statistics, computer science, analytics, or physics degrees. Are you seeing more healthcare and other STEM/non-STEM master's degree holders pivoting into data?

Also, if yall are still in Austin, definitely check out The Oasis on Lake Travis restaurant. Very scenic on the lake, it's perfect and the food is great!
Looking at the chat, I think they'll become data scientist if Tina made a course
The data multiverse!!! How amazing is this!
ahhhh my favorite data peeps! ‚ù§Ô∏è
if you ever feel lost? just look into the eyes of the people you loveüëç
Check out the #30DaysOfStreamlit here! https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/30days. Again, this is a great learning objective that can be done alongside the #66DaysOfData!
I do find the data in your kaggle. I do not find the script from the vid. Any help? Thanks. Thanks for the vid also. Very insightful.
I have trouble to run streamlit , then decide to do it on flask. Please advise
Instant sub, Great vid!
Hi, Ken - great video here. I wondered if you have more guidance around how you grabbed your dataset using the youtube API? I am thinking about getting the data from another channel and would love your input there.
Im a self taught and still learning basics of python, my career path will be data analyst or data science. 
Thanks for end to end tutorial . Awesome üòéüëç
I'll give it another try... but for now impossible to pass the initial install steps.
trying with venv and pip + requirements
... always some myterious dependency problems.
Anyway, tutorial sounds amazing and I'll come back once I have the patience or a clean computer.

AFTER A FEW DAYS ...
Tutorial is very good and I finaly got it working. However, it was easier for me to do it without conda and relying on the things I know pyenv and pip and it works just fine on python 3.10.
Thanks for your excellent work.üòÄ
It's a great video.
Thank you so much for such a good project. Would love to go along with more projects from scratch.
Hi Ken, Thank you so much for this project. It's an eye-opener. I have a problem though, my publish date column is also implementing colors. I would appreciate it if you could help me understand that better, Thanks again
Ken thank you so much for those videos! I was wondering if you could make a video about creating your own dataset/data scraping for portfolio project? Thanks:)
Hello, is it possible to use this project and show this data as a web interactive app that the user might interact with?
Hello Ken!
U am bew to Data Science and I really love your channel & content. I have a major in Food Science and I want to make a huge change to my life going into Data Science. What online complete course do you recommend for me to get please?
woww this video is a wonderful video and pushed me to some other videos in your channel. great content. thanks for uploads. ,.,.,.,.
Wow, this is exactly what i looking for! Thx Ken Jee
Is it necessary to create a python environment first?
Thanks for this video sir. Please make more like this üôè
Great video but maybe use a 16:9 monitor to record your videos.
Saya sangat suka betapa mudahnya projek ini untuk menjana wang tanpa terlalu banyak kerumitan. Saya suka sangat. Anda juga boleh mencuba.
00:01:50
Ooof I missed this from scratch series
always love when my favorite papayaManager drops such a sweet video <3
Let's do this!!
Super Informative video, but for some reasons I cant figure out how do you  run the code into the streamlit application page
Could you please share the same
this is the asian version of tailopez
Ken thanks so much for this I think these interactive video's where a complete data science project is worked through is what I've been missing
PROJECT FROM SCRATCH! Could you make an NFT of beepbeep next c:
For some reason I did not get the notif of this vid? wtf youtube, anyway CONGRATS on getting streamlit to sponsor your vid , lovely vid btw <3
Another installment of Ken's infamous Project from Scratch series!!

Thank you for continuing to make these videos Ken! Will be creating this for my portfolio.

It truly is amazing how such powerful and visually appealing dashboards can be created AND publicly displayed with Streamlit üëç
Woah this is super nice Ken!! Love that you walked us through your thought process in the feature engineering part. And bless you at 10:48 üòÑ (appreciate that you didn‚Äôt cut it out!)
You're always reading my mind. I got done with one of your Youtube datasets and was thinking of how to put the plots/visuals in a dashboard, but Dash seems overwhelming a bit. I'll study this tonight! Thank you again
Streamlit is super awesome! I use it for visualization in a lot of my courses. It's so easy to work with because it's Python. Deployment as Docker containers is also very good. I cannot recommend it enough. Great video Ken. What do you think of the recent purchase of Streamlit by Snowflake? Will that give it a big boost?
This is a fantastic video. Your channel is truly a gem. Not only for learning about coding part, but I really appreciate the opportunity to compare my current skill set to what is expected when I get my first ds job. Thank you, thank you.
10:48 Bless you!
It's been waaaaayy too long since we've had a Project from Scratch video, Ken! 
Loved seeing Streamlit being implemented in this!
Glad you kept contextualizing decisions in context of the use case. That is something that more people need to understand. 

PS: Emailed you as discussed. Did you receive it?
Haven't used streamlit before but definitely have to now üòÅ
You could do a quick open tabs video just for fun if that‚Äôs your thing. Similar to what Bert Kreischer does. Who knows might be funny or interesting.
*That is a fantastic project!* Thanks for the complete walkthrough!
Love Streamlit! Been using them at work and for fun for over a year now. Love these detailed tutorials as well
Wow i was just doing Data science Jobs project and here,s another.
Ooo it's been a while since we had similar project videos I like watching these ..  For the requirements.txt file I just add the modules that I used but after a quick google search it seems like adding everything is better for 2nd+ degree dependency versions ? This makes it easier lol ! Great video Ken Thank you !!!
Wow, that's a great end-to-end tutorial from the thought process, setting up the development environment, data wrangling and finally putting everything together in the dashboard app.
Cool Stuff! Definitely gonna try streamlit to build a dashboard of some sort.
It's amazing how easy it is these days to build visually appealing dashboards.

What job questions do you have? Ask away below!
Great advice, thanks
Love this advice
What I hope to show? My skills/knowledge
I hope showcase my critical thinking skills.
I‚Äôve been following you for a few  months while I start my data career. Thanks for all the information sharing! I‚Äôve had my first 3 interviews in the last 2 weeks.
Funny thing is, I have applied to close to 500 jobs in the past few months. Cold emails get ghosted or ask me to "apply online directly." Oh gee, why didn't I think of that?! And so far I have gotten ZERO interviews.
With my portfolio I plan on showing 3 of the top world changing projects that are relevant to my field of interest
Hey Ken, first of all thank you very much for all your content which is invaluable for a beginner like me üòÅ second, I would suggest, if possible, for you to make a video about the different industries in which Data professionals are more relevant nowadays, in terms of job opportunities and such. Also if there's different approaches on the workflow depending on the industry. That would be very nice! üôÇ üëç
Wondering about opptys for those seeking to freelance only, or work in a contractor role.
Hypothesis: People aren't landing those jobs, because they're not plucking their monobrow effectively. Please do a video on the data points one should be analyzing when deciding how much monobrow to remove.
To show that I qualify to be accepted for the job
Your videos have been such a driving force for my motivation, Ken! I‚Äôm a physical therapist hoping to use my doctorate in PT and medical domain knowledge to eventually leverage my way into a medical data science position. I find myself going to your channel at least once or twice a day and soaking up any insights you provide. Keep up the good work! Your content is valuable to many.
I just started applying to data science jobs this week. There are so many postings, but so few of them I actually want to apply to.
Hey Ken, great video as always thanks for sharing. I am trying to transition from a senior operations manager in tech to a Data Analyst, and I'm having some difficulty.  I know it doesn't sound like I should but it's definitely happening. Can you share your thoughts on how one should approach transitioning from various roles to Data Science?
I love the way you explains the complex things in very simple way. No surprise that you are very good in networking. Your videos are very useful and I am looking forward to learn alot in future as well. Keep up the good work. üòä
I am still confused about how to approaching the job search as a data problem and using that to my advantage
Love this video!  I appreciate the insight.
Thank you Ken
Great insights shared with a lot of useful tips that can help maximize landing a data job. It made me realize a couple of things that I can improve, specially narrowing down my job searching opportunities, focus my portfolio to fields i'm interested in and improve my networking. Thanks a lot for sharing this content! Amazing stuff!
Hi Ken I got called after 2 days for a position called business controller junior intern, and I rejected them as I have exams behind and as they were offering me a 8h full time which seemed impossible combined with studies or attending lessons. I thought that after this I could later transition to business analyst and data analyst. 
Data engineering seems great but codes I found from free courses didn‚Äôt work out, compared to data analytics courses and data science courses.
A lot of my students are having recruiters reaching out to them for entry level analyst roles. Just uploading your resume to Indeed with the right keywords can open up a lot of opportunities.
Nice glasses .
Oh God I really need to dig deeper to find the field I want to specialize in .. Googling DS in anime and cinema rn lol
What is the likely hood you would make a video to help DSIT (Data Scientist in training) decide what area/subject matter they want to pursue? I‚Äôd like to be candidate B that has a clear portfolio area if interest. If I just knew what that was‚Ä¶..
This is a great video. I will echo your point about networking being extremely valuable. Both myself and many of my friends have landed their current jobs because of a referral from someone in the company. In fact, one thing to add is that most companies offer referral bonuses to current employees who refer someone that eventually gets hired. So, it's not only good for you as a job seeker to network and make connections, there's also a big incentive for employees to network with you and give you that referral.
awesome video, it's the portfolio part for me, I can assert to that since it happened to me like a month ago. I had applied for a job and after I landed it they said they picked me coz from my portfolio they noticed a skill that they needed.  Not that am better than the rest of the applicants but i think it's about what is needed.
Shoutout to Richardson, TX (suburb of Dallas) at 2:43
"So I see you're applying for the data scientist position here at papaya enterprises"

That was great ü§£
This is incredible! Thanks for the minute details!
Thank you Ken for the tips. They are quite useful and pratical and for me I struggle most with the portfolio, on the projects to pick. I'm thus looking forward to this video.
I use my portfolio for both sharing the topics I‚Äôm interested in and showing the workflow I adopt to tackle data projects üìä
I planned to post daily on Twitter but I fell off, I would do more of network from today on.
As for my portfolio it still in progress, am taking my time before sending applications.
I‚Äôve included the projects that I like and interests me the most in my portfolio.
Ken Jee thank you for the insight
Made my day hearing this from a data scientist: 
1:18 "Data analyst roles are a fast track into data science" üôåüèº Data Analysts FTW!!
#PapayasIncToTheMoon üöÄüçà
Most HR women are not going to read your portfolio because they don't understand it.

They read your resume first, make you take a coding test that doesn't actually reflect the job, then if you pass the coding test,  you get to talk to the hiring manager who might then be interested in your portfolio but most of them are not going to be too interested unless it 100% matches what they do for their projects
Networking was a game changer for me so I totally agree. I personally landed all my internship and First job through LinkedIn Networking üíØ
OMG this is too much knowledge for me hahaüíØüôå
Amazing video as usual and loving this tips 
I think there are a lot of data roles which doesn't have job title data into it.
their coding requirement is too high
and I took this personally.... wow ken nice emotional damage XD (crying inside)
The issue with trying AB testing with the CVs that you send is that you don't send that many CVs or get that many results. The small sample size can really skew your results.
Something that no one tells you is when people hire. I got most of my job in early fall and early spring. It's not uncommon to not get a single callback for months, and then all of sudden get more than I can handle.
The other thing is, since HR tends to read your CVs first, be sure to tailor your CV to them with buzzwords that they'll understand.
Hi Ken, I spent some time learning to code and becoming comfortable with it. Today's video could not come at a better time for me. I am now focusing more time to create some portfolio projects. Do you suggest any web services that are best suited to showcase data science and tableau projects on the same platform?
The finding what you like advice is imo so overlooked, I'm glad you covered it. It's always the thing I put as step 1 in my content about learning Machine Learning/implementing it for businesses. 

Wrt to the portfolio point you make, you're spot on. However I think what is arguably more valuable than having a specific project for industry is to read how different industries make money. This will allow you to get a birds eye view of what is important, what is feasible, technical challenges etc. That way you can highlight different aspects of your projects to different parties.
Speaking of Networking, I would love to talk to you about a few things. Is it possible to connect? What is your preferred outreach platform?
Awsome Video Ken! Greatly appreciate your efforts!
Hey I hope to show my skills and creativity with my portfolio
So I put my resume on Dice, got a job through LinkedIn three months ago, and now I keep receiving e-mails from so many random recruiters üòÇ
Thank you. I got rejected yesterday after getting to the last interview yesterday. I start with another interview today! It‚Äôs competitive out here but keep going. My biggest hurdle is  behavioral interviews but I‚Äôll keep going.

Edit: also always try to add a personal touch to how you know the business in your interview. Show the employer you went out your way not to just know about the data side of their business, but also about their specific problems and How it ties into their product and service offerings.
With my portfolio I hope to share my skill and knowledge level through the projects I‚Äôve carried out
First of all, I want to thank you very much for your valuable content and your great efforts. I'm a student of Master Maths and I'm very interested in developing myself in the field the Data science.
Most of the companies need more experience and one more is if experience is less you must have exceptional skills.
Hi..I'm from Algeria üá©üáøüá©üáø...Thank you

Hey Ken, just got admitted to MS in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University. Is there any way (in another comment, email, etc.) in which I could get your quick opinion on what courses should I focus on taking so I can make my experience as valuable as possible ?
Sorry Ken! Haven't been able to stay active in the comment section lately because of the exams
Soon we will have our own collection of DS peeps NFTs lol .. Great video Ken ! Useful for tax evasion ig lol
"wen utility?" Loved this video so much, and has me excited for doing some more data analysis in the space!
So cuuuuuuuuuute! I need to do an angry papaya project.
NFTs are pretty risky so some data analysis is certainly useful for anyone who wants to get into them. Frankly, after getting in on NFTs early, I'm totally out now. One other example of risk is how little regulation there is upfront. I flipped an NFT that a few days later was determined to be copywritten material and the entire project was deleted from OpenSea entirely. Anyone who still had one in their wallet got stuck holding the bag on that one.

Would be interesting to do some analysis that allowed you to spot trends and get in on NFT projects before they really blew up. Still feels like gambling though lol.
I really appreciate the great you did Mr.Ken Jee it is really amazing. I'm so interest  with data from the perspective of the reearch .
NFT itself is a scam :)
Awesome!  Keep it up
This investigative data science work by you and Avery was üî•üî•
.... But KEN... the people still DEMAND a Papaya NFT!!!
#PapayasIncToTheMoonüçàüöÄ
There's so much to NFT tbh, onf of the worst aspects are them being used for money laundering :(
This was cool. Strikes me as a bit out of the ordinary for the types of videos you usually make, but a good change of pace. Keep it up.
That might've been the greatest Ken Jee intro I've ever seen ü§£
This is so eye-opening and interesting!! I will definitely have a look at the analyses you did in more detail and am curious about the code as well. Thanks Ken and Avery for being true data scientist detectors in this whole NFT craze! üòç
I agree with what you said...
But I still think we need our Papaya NFT!!!

Keep them coming, please! Someone is trying to cheer us up. Correction, thanks to all 4 of them.
STORIES | NOT STARTED | DONE hahaha real-life board!
So hilarious you have pictures of other data scientists on your desk))
There's a Tinaa and ken photo, In the luke's desk. I think they are somehow related, I'll keep researching on it.
So accurate!!!!!!,  we just switch from Kanban to scrum , and we too have been struggling with time constraints and we've turned everything to stories !
Stick with the data science ... leave the humor to those who are actually funny.  Man that was cringy to watch ... smh!
Haha.  Well done, guys!
This is one of the best written videos I‚Äôve seen in a long time.
The photo of Alex The Analyst at 1:55 cracked me up! üòÇüòÇ
Tina and Data professor pictures üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This was gold!! üòÇ

#PapayaMasterKen
Project manager exists to remove obstacles for the team so they can remain continuously focused on deliverables instead of...not deliverables...

If they don't do that, then get another one.
Project manager... No no sorry Papaya Master always says everything is possible üòÇ
Figuring out a correct estimate is really hard sometimes consider many factors but we should do it atleast we keep ourselves on track
As a PM making a career transition into DS... If my company gave me the title of Papaya Master I might have to reconsider.
üòÇ is the pm the poison of micro-management?
Awesome video !  Do u mind sharing the Python template script that u used for EDA ?
Perfection
Lmaoo
A certain cable network needs to greenlight "Silicon Papaya"
Its funny when hes looking at the picture frames lmao
oh god this is so accurate it hurts - better go work on my story. Also Tina would say ah yes, I think it will be done in 2 weeks with a 95% confidence interval that has an upper bound of 3 years and then go back to watching anime :x
LOLOL too relatable. I‚Äôm pretty sure my PM‚Äôs want to rip their hair out with how little I update my Jira boards‚Ä¶ also found out my PM had a previous life as a SWE recently üòπüòπ

ü§£ü§£ü§£
Cool stuff üòâüòâ
Guys, that was awesome! Perfectly well done and even had a couple of useful recommendations thrown in, as well. Oh, and Luke's Power BI, histogram scatter plot. LOL.
I've been in the telecom industry since early 2020, firstly as a network engineer but recently I got to become a data engineer for network performance and analytics. Project Managers dont do anything but schedule meetings, take notes and force me to rush on the tasks. "Visibility Bla bla bla" nobody has seen me working overnight
"Stories" üòÇ funny, at my first day of work I thought it has something to do with insta and thought they accidentally hired me as a digital marketing guy.üòÇüòÇ
This is really funny and accurate üíØ
We are rooting for more luke and Ken collaboration üíØüôå
Hahaha this was top tier guys. But don't laugh too loud... the Papaya Master could be listening...
üòçü§©
I sort of agree with the video, sometimes it's hard to fit a Scrum workflow method to data products, but it can be done if the PM really know what he's doing.
Tina would probably be watching anime
Not tasks! Stories... Not stories! User stories ü§£
you know a role called papaya master in the 66days server would be a good one
0:36 and 1:55 Epic moments, haha! Great skit Ken!
Next Video title - How To Become A Papaya Master
So we can ALL agree.... PM stands for "Papaya Master" üôåüèº
#PapayasIncToTheMoon üçàüöÄ
haha this was gold
I see a data cinematic universe forming....
Cool to see the data community so close with everyone but I died when he replaced Ken's picture with Alex üíÄüíÄüòÇ
Amazing collaboration.. as always üòÅüëåüëå
Hahah It's so fun to see all my favourite Data peeps in one video like this üåª ! Absolutely loved it Ken, Luke
always TOP
OMG the easter eggs!  Papaya, and a Panda, and Alex, I only wish I knew who Tina was.  And I do know a high level lead (over devs tho) who used to work at NASA but no longer touches code.  This is so perfect - thanks for a monday morning pick-me-up!
Papaya master üòÇü§≠
I agree it really stands for papaya master! üòÇ
This humor is too advance for me to comprehend.

Great and awsome ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Great video‚Ä¶it gave a good overview of the data scientist job. Thanks
cool!!!!!!
Thanks Ken! Excited to enter this Domain!
Hello, thanks so much for your video.
I want to use Data science in Cybersecurity, should I go through all the journey or what can you advice me? Thank you
So, the structure that you described sounds like agile methodology. Am I right?
Thank you for this! I am trying to change careers to Data Scirnce and was wondering if companies offer on the job training. I am in my first semester of a masters program, undergrad degree in mathematics, but have 15 years work history in heavy construction. I would like to gain as much work experience as I can while I learn. In construction we have apprenticeship programs.
Hello,
Are you able to get a sharpest minds mentor if you are at the beginning phase without any experience?
not all decisions are mad with logic. this hits really hard the long you work in any field :)
btw the link in the bio isnt including your ref=kenjee, might want to change that so you get a comission
im an etl developer who does machine learning. literally spend most of my time scrubbing/cleaning/transforming data. derp
I just came across your data science course on Skill up by simpililearn, I'll like to know, if I move on with this course, will it give me all the skills required as a data scientists? Or what are your recommendations
Ahhhh i'm in high school and really interested in data science and plan on majoring in it.. i just am a bit chary on the math involved because I'm unsure on how much and why math is involved in the first place. It isn't my best subject but i hope that doesn't stop me from one day becoming a data scientist.
To help others out and save money I'd recommend do NOT go to college, get a few data related certificates. Start off as a entry level data analyst and while working utilize Udemy and YT on data science info. 

After approximately 3-5 years as a data analyst apply to a data science job. Boom! Just saved you money. Any further details needed, just let me know.

Also, Google is your best friend. Learn how to use it being in the data world.
Thank you for posting this video. This past year I migrated to a new work role and am listed by my employer as a data scientist.  This video confirmed my understanding and also cleared up confusion as many people, my employer, and consumers of our products have different views of a data science work role.
One of the best reveals I‚Äôve seen about data science. My question now is if it‚Äôs better to be a product manager or project manager? Autonomy and authority are some of the most important job factors for me. Are the product and project managers literally managers to data scientists and software engineers?
11:02 "sometimes kevin doesnt want to use the stupid dashboard that you built and spent 7 weeks on because he doesn't like the color scheme and he wants to use pie charts all over the place"..... Had me DYING üíÄ I had to pause it. I played this clip for my husband *not a data scientist* and he laughed because THAT is me while I'm working from home.
9:30 What would be good questions to ask in an interview?
Currently completing a data science apprentership within the forestry sector. At the moment, I am still finding how to tie what I am learning into work but I am sure it will kick in once I get to machine learning and AI (in 2nd year out of 4.. so still doing somewhat foundational study)

Came from having done a degree in forestry, and I wanted to go into research.. came across this during lockdown and thought it would be along the same lines and I would be working in a company I was interested in. :) 

I am settled into a team and with that, I have got ideas.. I just need to make time to explore it and figure out how to start :)
Isn‚Äôt this like the millionth video you made with this same title ?
No words, just likessssssss!!! Do not waste another day > Promo`SM!!
Awesome video, it gives us so much hidden information that is actually practical.
I want to be a Data Scientist in the future. So this is gonna be good. Haven't watched the video yet but I'm liking this because I'm team Data Science all way.
I‚Äôm 26 and I have one year left in my Data Science curriculum, plus my master‚Äôs program. Currently learning MySQL and I‚Äôm trying to learn Python and R on the side. It‚Äôs really tough since I‚Äôm in a data structures course using Java, and that takes up a good bit of my time. Hopefully it all works out for the best. 
Also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as I go, and making sure I‚Äôm sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills.
11:01 was oddly relatable üòÇ
If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job, if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job. 

Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)

In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have

For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes

I have been in both, my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years. Personally, I can say ML engineering is more fun, even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy AI methods
Data scientists love their jobs so much that they spend more time making videos about data science than data science...
Now i am curious, do you ACTUALLY work 40 all hours a week as a data scientist? Or is that just a formality? I realise some times there is more work to do sometimes there is less, and so space for more free time. How does this work in the US?
They mostly write 30 page long SQL queries that nobody can read or understand and then they sit back and play with their balls a lot because some idiot director is terrified of firing them and having to look at the 30 page long SQL queries themselves.
Learning Sql. Can already do OOP with python and several languages. Should I learn R when I'm done?
most of these apply for most engineering - and innovation driven jobs I think
I'm working as an Associate Data Scientists at a startup and I honestly haven't needed to code for like 5 months. They've got me focused on an e-learning initiative.
For anyone curious, the project management framework he‚Äôs talking about in the video is ‚Äúagile‚Äù
I am a Data Analyst, therefore I code a lot in SQL in any dialect. NoSQL is important as well
Hi Ken can I ask you if it‚Äôs true that data analysts are in more demand that data scientists? 
Idk if eventually I just found a blog which supports more this position rather than data science roles. 
As I knew Data analysts usually do things less advanced and let data scientists focus on more advanced things, but I suppose it depends on the location involved, on demographics (more or less people as candidates), on the field involved (tech, banks, manufacturers etc) 
Could you make a video about ‚Äúsupply and demand dynamics on data science vs data analytics/analysis jobs?
Unrelated question. Can I ask what brand/type of glasses do you wear? I like that style
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
Great job man,
Data scientist from France.
It is far more similar to a SAP Consultant job than I was thinking. The only difference is that the tools and the data you use as a data scientist aren't as predefined as an SAP Consultant which has it's pros and cons I guess. But for starters learning from 40 years of experience as best practices in SAP is invaluable, it not only holds the consultants hands but also the customers too so that when things get silly you can say that this is a standard for more than 40 years and they should do it üòÇ
I have an online data science test am nervous which site can assist with the tests
Im 35 years old, and I just started my Data Science journey by starting college this semester.  Been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue Data science. Thank You Ken, I'll be tuning into your channel just to keep my 'ear to the ground' in this exciting field. Also, not sure if you spoke on this before, but what laptop do you recommend for data science? Thanks Buddy and keep up the good work!
#TeamDataScience
I can TOTALLY relate with everything you said!! Great video, people who is considering entering Data world should see this video and know thats the way it is in real life
Man it's been a while since I've come here to comment.  Always great content master master ken! Your videos always help motivate to improve my skills each and everyday.
Miss the times when data science was simply called statistics. Now every company wants a ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù that can do:

1. Business management.
2. Presentations.
3. Data fetching and collection.
4. Research.
5. Model building and deployment.
6. Model performance evaluation.
7. Cloud environments.
8. Database administration.
9. Pipeline building and management.
10. Client management.

With statistician the responsibilities where quite clear because now every person that works on anything related to data is now a Data Scientist.
I spend 90% of my time as a data scientist on powerpoint...
Very informative
I am really liking the Sharpest Mind's concept and something definetly worth looking into
This video is amazing it literally sums up most of the work data scientist do. I love the first few sec because that's literally me in the morning when I open my mails haha. I think the project management is very up to the points the data scientist role and project manager role has common things is all softs skills and managing work and which is very important in data science job role.
Any video coming up on what data engineer do?
Subscribed within the first 2mins. Thanks for this
I'm 6 months into junior DS role and God I am relieved to hear such things, make me not that disappointed in my jobüòÖ
That‚Äôs a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist, this video came at the right moment as I transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video. As mentioned in the later part of the video, I also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a double-edged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation. Papaya Tracker sounds like an interesting personal project!
What I looking for is Actually on Python SQL Tableau Power BI Job as what happen like my daily practice during learn data science, but I have no idea if the Job desc is variative
Great video! But those ad hoc reports üòï
Great video! I have one question. Is it better to start learning the Data Analyst course by Google (coursera) or just go direct to Data Science course on coursera? I am new in this area, but i already created some simple apps using swift, for hobbie.
Ah but you didn‚Äôt reveal the ultimate secret: ignore XFN unless they ask you at least 2 times üôÉ and then say that maybe you can do it next week to manage expectations üëç
Thanks for the video Ken ! I can relate to everything you said and also about Asana and the tickets lol .. Hopefully will get used to them.
Glad to see you again !
My manager loves daily Stand-Ups... me on the other hand, not so much....
#TeamDataScience #PapayasIncToTheMoon üöÄüçà
This actually answered a couple of questions I had about working professionally. I know that SW Engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasn't sure if Data Science followed that same trend. Thanks Ken!

Now to watch this 400,000 more times so we can beat Forrest.
Cheers man!
One of the most important things that I wish more people would do is documentation. Of datasets, sources, code, rationale etc. I often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things. Everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different Datasets, how things are collected, what features are used, distributions etc
A great explanation Ken Jee ‚ô•Ô∏è
I liked that, you ended a video on positive note.

Hi, i have an option to attend a course called "Optimization in data science" at my university (it's probably going to be very math oriented as I study math) and I wonder if that's something worth spending time on.
Nice video Ken!! I was watching some other related videos and saw that a good Data Scientist should work "independently", without needing to wait for orders from the boss. 

What do you think about it? Does Kaggle helps with this "independency" and confidence to extract a lot of data and analyze it?
666 views, I will program as hell! üòà
0:45 Challenge accepted! #TeamSoftwareDevelopment üòÑ
Thank you so much for this v√≠deo.
#TeamDataScience
What am I looking for In a data scientist job you ask? 







Copy paste
Thanks for the great video Ken!
As a People Analyst in a Telecommunications company, (doing both data analysis and data science) my work can be really different in just a couple hours haha
Data scientist can also be tasked with making pizzas.
Sorry for the repetitive joke lol.
NOTION HAS A DARK THEME???????? my life has been a lie, thanks for more insights into the data science world üê¢
Also early gang ü¶æ
I am actually looking for a data science job in biology...bioinformatics data science....can u suggest me any company
I hope you all will join me on this project! Link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/ken-jee-youtube-data
This could be a great one to engage with on your #66daysofdata journey!
I‚Äôm new but I‚Äôll give it a try over summer, college finishes in 3 weeks ü§ù
Ken,

Thanks for inspiring me to follow my passions through your content. I was working as a financial advisor and hated my life and you gave me the confidence i needed to make the leap and study data science. I'm almost done with my first project and owe a lot of my confidence to you. Keep it up!
No I think not :pepe_hands:
How long do we have?
This is such a wonderful iniative! Looking forward to tinkering around with the data you have shared!
HI Ken! How about a video on how did you extract and arrange this data?
The keyword "Papaya" spikes view counts
Uni exams but I'm so excited about this!
This is cool. I‚Äôll try it out! Thanks Ken!
It also helps me knowing the kind of data science questions to ask in my workplace.
Awesome, this is going to be fun, feel free to count me in as one of your staff for Staff‚Äôs favorites? ü§î
Well, even though I don't how to do, I'm still gonna try..
Thanks
Wow, this is such a cool way to engage with the community. Thanks Ken.
I bet I can make a better pizza.
thank you for this! i‚Äôve been looking for projects to tackle
Been listening your podcast. This is good time to start with.. Will definitely look into it.
Wow, That's will be exciting to participate üôå

I learn a lot abt data science through your videos thank u
YAY I get a shoutout :O Also do I get credit for lurking LOL
Wow ‚ô•Ô∏è Nice work Ken Jee ‚ô•Ô∏è
Congratulations to all the winnersüéâüéä  and thank you for the wishes ‚ù§

Ken, I would like to like to say huge thanks to you for everything you have done for me till now. Honestly, you are like a catalyst for me to learn data science. At the start of 2021, I was just exploring things about data science and I came across your channel. Your content really helped me to move in a proper direction which is essential for me. The #66daysofdata is an amazing challenge that made me consistent to learn things. 

12 months of journey taught me many things and now I got a huge surprise from you which I can never forget and I will always be thankful and grateful to you. I really don't have words to express my happiness.
Good work Ken! And congrats to all the winners:)
Congratulations to all the winners! I love the way how you make your subscribers engaged with great contents and the appreciate them with prizes.
OMG This is such an amazing idea why haven't other channels tried this!!!!
That's awesome, congrats to the winners!
Love this channel and the YouTube data science community. I've learned so much here and from Luke and Tina. I'm looking forward to seeing how much progress I can make in my journey for this year!
Guess I need to put everything aside and start writing a bot for comments on Ken's videos, using an algorithm that determines the precise sequence of words to acquire the highest number of likes and engagement.
Avicii is commenting on your videos? Damnnn. I thought I had clout
Nice incentive for the Community üòÇü§ì
I didn't win but I'm gonna email you anyway.
Congratulations to the leader.
OMG! Thanks ken :)
Congratulations to all the winners ‚ú®
Hey Ken, love your content and podcast! I‚Äôm currently an analytical chemist and aspiring data scientist, hoping to combine the two one day in a professional role. If anyone else has already combined them let me know how it went for you!
A unique way to appreciate the engagement of the audience on your channel! Now I got to know why you read each and every comment! haha üòÇüëèüëå
Congratulations to the winners
I will always refer to you as the "Data Science King ü§¥üèª" #PapayasIncToTheMoon üöÄüçà

Best of luck to everyone in 2022 ! If you miss one video I'll probably climb to top 5 so please don't lol
I need it broüî•üî•üî• lucky people's‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è....
Anything for me?üôÇ
DATA SCIENCE KING üëë btw The Omen packs looks AWESOME.
Thanks for watching everyone! Do you like data science related stories like this? Let me know other ones you would like me to deep dive into in the comments below!
This still happens every race everyday still you can bet a 5-1 horse in the gate then be 2-1 when it goes off
AI model easy to train now aday. the main is how to transform the real data. you get the magic data. you get the race!!!!
Nothing new here.
What a load of BS,   Benter knows fuk all about horse racing.   Impossible to win at Black Jack count counting does NOT enable you to win.    Chasing losses is a dogshit way to financial ruin.       The factors expressed are all BS, dogshit    ha ha ha ha This is for SUCKERS.
He did all this in HK at the time There were only 2 tracks , now there are 3 All horses at the time and possibly still now ? ,  were domestic to HK as in no horse travelled in or out , much easier having the exact same horses running on the same 2 tracks  once/ twice a week ,Data wise .He also threw stupid money at every race trying to hit a trifecta of trifectas  ,as in the correct position of 123 horses in 3 separate races .My point  is you could not replicate this anywhere else ,HK has a small pool of horses and no horses in or out of the country like say the UK . If I must take the shine off it , it pretty much had nothing to do with the actual horses IMO it was the combination of numbers and the sheer volume of tickets that got him his wins . Just like me Playing max entries in a DFS contest week in week out your chances increase the more you play .
Excellent video ! Could you be more specific about the models that are better than multinomial logistic regression for this type of job ?
Great video, you really explain well ! Very interesting topic, just a quick question, when you talk about better models, helping to avoid multicolinearity, could you be more specific ?
You talk too fast. Please slow down.
Was he using software for this?
incredible content  thanks
my goal is to become a professional gambler. I told my guidance counselor I wanted to be one and she said that there is no such thing as being a pro gambler. I showed her this documentary on bill benter but she still thinks pro gambling isnt a good career.  How can I get started being a pro gambler?
One of the better explanations of Benters work online - nice job
Great content! Very helpful insights. Just wondering though if same model could be followed for state horse racing lotteries?
Nobody has a "Gambling Problem", only a "LOSING $% PROBLEM"!!!
Daily horse racing tips, avg +20U / month
9:13 you misunderstood what Benter meant by "pool size limitations".  In pari-mutuel wagering, the payoffs are calculated by how much money is wagered on each horse (or combination).  What he meant is "how much can you wager into a pool before your own bets reduce the payoffs to a point of no longer being 'value' bets".
‚ÄúI never dreamed about success. I worked for it.‚Äù
I think Is hard to beat the Booker
I tried my hand at poker for about a year. I am not good at it. I think I'll try writing a Q-learning trading bot to make my side money instead.
At least in the US, data availability isn't that great unless you're willing to spend significant amounts of money. Also, most of the race tracks in the US not only don't ban the computer model betters, they actually make rakeback deals with them to give them a big advantage over the everyday better.
one very important aspect that he acknowledges at the outset is that Happy Valley is a 'closed system' , meaning horses arrive on the island and stayed for the whole season (which was not that long, and they did not have races every night).  This certainly would have allowed him to better establish an accurate hierarchy (ie horse A has placed higher than horse B every time)  compared to the typical scenario of horses coming in, racing, and then off to another track (as happens in the US and UK).  Regarding suitability to today, you forget that the UK has Exchanges which operate differently than the Tote system Benter had to bet under.  The HK Jockey Club took out 18% off the top, and Benter still overcame that 'hole' and walked away a rich man.  The UK exchanges take out 1% plus a commission of 3-5% depending on who you bet with.  A much shallower hole to deal with.
Thanks Ken, very good video
The entry to Machine Learning and sports betting can be steep if you are not a coder, here is an easier way to gain an ML approach to sports betting https://youtu.be/PzdcwGLDifk
great content!

sauda√ß√µes from brazil o/
This is awesome. Honestly, I've always wanted to try sports betting lol (but to anyone reading, I didn't say that :P)
Ken, have you ever attended the Sloan Analytics Conference in Boston?  A professional bettor that appeared on  the ‚ÄúBetting With an Edge.‚Äù Podcast and YouTube channel mentioned it.  He indicated it was a conference for the analytics folks from the American pro sports leagues.
I'm sorry and I don't mean to be rude or distract from your message because I truly respect and admire what do. But I've been a follower of yours for a while now, and I think you're really hot. ‚ù§
A quick note on Correlated/Colinear Features. These can be a huge pain for applications such as Sports Betting, where we are weighing certain factors relative to other factors. Concepts such as introducing dropout, random noise, and using clustering to engineer/select features might be helpful. Doing that would reduce the costs of running a model, improving ROIs even if drops absolute performance
Thanks Ken, this is superb story to share it my brother to introduce him to applications of ML in real world before data chaos
This is so. freaking. sick. Awesome vid as always my guy!
Love this!
Great video Ken. I want to ask you for an opinion. I started an internship in a data virtualization project, but my goal Is to work as a data scientist or data analyst. What you think about It? Is It good starting point to enter in this area?
Very cool video. Enjoyed the video thoroughly
Bookies have full DS teams these days...
Hey ken, Can you check the 2nd example of Kelly criterion. It looks like, you have mistakenly put 1 in down. I am really getting confused when doing this math. Please, help..
So much big brain talk, finance is one of the sector I really want to excel in professionaly and personally, nonetheless great video!
man people back in the days are amazing. how do they even collect data back then? all on paper?
Ken, we need to make a ML model to predict Papaya futures!!
#PapaysIncToTheMoon üçàüöÄ
Mom, I'm not a degenerate gambler who had to move back home because I lost all my money, I'm a data scientist!
Really enjoyed this style of video! Such an informative and interesting breakdown, crazy to think that model was super advanced a while ago! + title and thumbnail game is on point! Nice one, Ken!
Damn it. This was my backup plan if I ever decided to have my own "breaking bad" story. I've been beaten. Time to find a new market to do this in. Perhaps slap fighting. I didn't get my degrees in math and stats for nothing! R e e e e e e e. 

Great video though, Ken. Hahaha, I love stories like this. I know ultimately at the end of the day you're only really supposed to make content that you enjoy and are proud of, but if that involves seeing more stuff like this, than I'm all for it!
This is a great video, please keep up the good work. Really looking forward to these Machine Learning case studies like this
I can't wait to make a video in 5 years called "How @Ken Jee Made $1,000,000 by Playing Zed Run"
Really nice video
Do more videos of this kind
Wow he lived out my dreams üòÇ
I really appreciate that you acknowledged gambling addictions at the end. Fun video, I learned a lot.
Great video Ken ! This makes me feel more excited about following your future ML courses üåª
Great video, although in future videos could you adjust these numbers with inflation so it matches it's current value? Would be interesting to see, cheers!
lol I was just reading the Bloomberg article this week.
Finding a way to beat horse racing was the reason I got into data science to begin with.

Since you aren't against a sportsbook employing Stanford alums, you just have to beat people and the vig. 

Needless to say, it's far easier said than done. I knew some of this,  but not nearly all. This is incredible.
Amazing story !
Thanks for watching everyone! New web 3 project is going to be an analysis of some web 3 data! What type of web 3 data would you be interested in seeing us analyze? Also, I apologize for the audio poorer audio quality on this one. Using a new camera and I guess I didn't tune it right!
Late to this video, but great breakdown of web 3 w/ data science.
0:55 hosting a website on a server had a lot of overhead ; 2.0 is about platforms hosting pages and content for customers 
Web 3 ‚Äî Return to decentralized 1.0 without overhead
Bother your noice in not so clear
Tbh, web 3 is not very exciting, the most exciting thing is how you can earn money via cryptocurrency, NFT, etc.
I have always been lazy to check out the world behind web3.
Hello Ken, do you think it's possible to become a data scientist without university? And what would you suggest to improve my math/stats knowledge? Maybe something even recognized around? I'm a full stack java/js developer right now trying to move to data science (i've learn python, sql, etc) but i see strict requirements around, even for ultra junior positions. Thanks
Interesting! Will check the post to know more.
It's always so nice and refreshing to see a nonbiased and critical video on web3.
Another trendy word right now is the "Metaverse", would love to hear your thoughts on that.
Thank you!
Hey Ken! Great introductory video! Thanks :) i have been doing small projects involving blockchain. For example, I scrape blockchain data but i do it using beautifulsoup and selenium. There are APIs but most are not well documented and are not free. When you said ‚Äúnew tools‚Äù to work with blockchain data, what do you mean? Also, if you are looking for projects, i would love to brainstorm with you and come up with ideas. I am already working on one and would be great to discuss it with you :)
Hey Ken! I would love to hear opinion from you regarding your graduate program at DePaul. Do you think it is a good program for someone without formal CS background? I studied Quantitative Economics as undergrad without programming experience, except statistical programs like eViews, Stata and SPSS. I am currently doing internship at Fortune 200 company as Data Analyst where I will craft my Data Modelling, Analysis and Visualization skills using ( Power) Excel, PowerBI, SQL, Python Spark, matplotlib, pandas etc.
Thank you for your video always !! But I want Korean subtitle !! :)
Arrrrrgggghhhhhh.......... the  audio!!
it isn't relevant to data science but successfully you catch attention!
really catch the trend
xqcL
Just saw your comment on another video. It reminds me that I was an audience of u in 2019. Long time no see, Ken !! Glad to see u have almost 200k followers right now~~  Congrats!
Hey Ken, can you make a video for highschool students who want to learn more about data science..?
Audio‚Äôs a bit off ü§®
As a data scientist, that sounds really interesting. Could you expand on it more in future videos?
KEN! When are you dropping the Papaya NFT collection?!?!
#TheNFTsWeNeed üçàüöÄ #PapayasIncToTheMoon
If you enjoy work with data cryptography, niche databases (a lot of projects have their own way of QB and , graph data ... then web3 data science could be interesting for you.
I am excited PERIOD
Great video. Interesting that we sort of agree on the whole thing. Ive been stressing this for a while. The true way to make money in AI (especially in the Web 3 context) is through Data. People often think of big models and fancy architectures in Machine Learning, but that's not the major component
So its already Jan 17. Am I too late to start my #66DaysofData?
Loved your analysis of web 3, Ken! I've also recently researched a bit about blockchain for my CS study. Totally agreed, a lot of loose ends on the web 3 discussion that still needs to be solved before it can become mainstream.
Nice perspective. As a computational chemist applying ML methods I'm always highly suspicious about people being too excited about any new methodology. And even though I am a retail investor in crypto projects I just can't imagine most narratives to come true.
Awesome explanation Ken!!
All Ken's videos during the past year had perfect audio quality .. I think this is just some kind of bug or unexpected thing during editing or upload .. The video is very interesting though so I hope everyone can overlook this one time issue and focus on the topic üåª
As a data librarian web 3 will be instrumental in making data resources more accessible.
Perfect timing with this video!  I've had some articles about web3 on my reading list, so really glad you've nicely introduced us to this topic :)
So should I expect a ken and Avery colab? üëÄüëÄ
What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads? 
Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business? 
I don't think the recommendation system would be like throwing anything to the public what they want people to see (not what people want to see.). Facebook and Youtube are not hurt.
Bad audio quality
I think video has a audio issue. 
But I watched completely. 
Looking forward to read more about web3
Bro your voice has a problem
Secret web 3 project with?!? What!!!!! That sounds exciting. But seriously, every transaction being publicly available is a pretty cool idea, but also kinda scary. Think about your credit card bill being public. üò©
Can you please share how to get started a career in web3 ?
Click "had issues". The echo was awful.
Hey, as long as they pay me in experience üí™
Why aren't u posting broüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è
I'll take it
Tell me this position is bad while repeatedly beating it into my soul this position is bad.
Hey Can you suggest me some beginner python ml ds related projects for college project for college..
And also if you suggest any specific course or video on guide of how should i approach learning ds
Bro you recently suggest me a NLP(beginner) related video. And it was great I got lot from it... Would u plzz suggest me some more but must have a professional level NLP (project type or tutorial will also do the job) video. 
Thanks again ‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüòÉüòòüôÇ
No
Even with all these "strange" job aspects, I still decided to take the job because of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with Ken!! üôåüèº 
#PapayasIncToTheMoon üçàüöÄ #WeAreGonnaBuildSoManyPapayaDashboardsKen
I've had this many times in my field as well. Sad, they think they're doing you a favor
Ah, I see you've met my former employer
I mean if ken's offering it, he should take it blindly, I mean he gets ken as his coworker what else can anyone ask for? üò≥
this aint even a joke lol
Love your videos ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know below if you would be interested in a similar video to this for Deep Learning or Model Evaluation!  üëá
ken. You are awesome totally! Thank you very much
I have watched at least 5 to 6:00 training videos on the subject of ml and deep learning etc. And I will tell you that it has taken me four times as much effort to understand that s*** sorry to use a four letter words then to the value that I got out of it. Whereas your of comments and explanations and conceptual arm waving has given me so much so many answers that I wish I hadn't wasted so much time on the four or five of the training videos. I think you should be creating at least another 5 or 10 videos, similar videos and different topics or concepts of the whole machine learning and and and and and and related topics. I am so happy that I found you your presence and I'm so very grateful for the effort to putting in and I would be even more grateful to see more videos from you. Thank you so very much. Enjoy your day!
Very clear thx
Honestly i did not understand what a data scientist actually does
Hi! Love your videos, embarking on studies this year. Are the shelved books at 1:34 on your Amazon list or could you provide a list? Suffering from some shelf envy and keen to know more ü§î
Hats-off to you Mr Ken. Such an informative video üëåüëå
Hats-off to you Mr Ken. Such an informative video üëåüëå
@11:50 "there's just shades of certainty and uncertainty." i don't think i've heard that before and i'm definitely going to be using that!
Your sweet parents üòπ
Hi there. I hope you are having a good day. I just wanted to ask if it is a good option for me to switch my career from finance to data science? 
P.S: I like to do Math and statistics but not that much interested in accounting/finance.
I'm dipping my toes into the world of programming and com-sci and I was so confused on what a data scientist actually is but this really helped
what an elite explanation! helped alot
I've never seen a video so effectively inform an audience of everything a complete outsider to the topic would need to know without BS and droning on. You made my career path easier and I aspire to be as fluid and effective as you are as a speaker. Thank you!
Great video. I have a question. How possible is it for someone who is in their 40s and never did anything with programming to start this new career? Is it only a young person choice? Thank you.
love you bro
What are the requirements on getting a degree on data science
My god you are the only person in this internet who actually explained what data science is.
Inspirational
ƒ∞ have been watching your videos now for hours and really helped me so much and ƒ∞ just want to ask you one question i hope you can answer me now I'm starting course on DataCamp is it good enough ?
Thanks for this video, man. So useful. I'll meet you when I'm a Senior Lead Data Scientist at the Company I work for
Hi Ken, as always, your videos are insightful and easy to follow. Would you say that  one of the main distinctions between a data analyst and a data scientist is that the analyst focuses on what happened? While the scientist is looking for future possible outcomes? Thanks so much again for your hard work in helping us!
Great! Now I can just shove this video in my parents' face next time they ask me what I plan on doing later on in life LMAO
Wow, this video is brilliant. My only problem is that the title looks like a clickbait when it actually delivers what it promises haha.
So much chatter around data science these days but very few voices really know the field and of those even fewer have the clarity and generosity to share it in approachable/useful videos like this. Congratulations for the quality of your work and a big thank you.
I noticed in this video you mention the tools used for a Data Scientist but don't say too much about the math that's used regularly. This seems to be a common trend on "How to Become a Data Scientist" videos. They almost exclusively talk about learning Python, R, SQL etc. but rarely go into any detail on the math involved in the field. I'm in a masters program for Data Science and it's pretty heavily math focused to begin. Just an idea for a future video. 

Anyway, thanks for consistently putting content out, you're videos have really helped me in understanding the direction I want to go!
Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you.

I think same is happening these days,

Just because you do not take an interest in data science doesn't mean Data Science won't take an interest in you.
This video will be definitely useful  üíØ for some of my friends or data science aspirants but I think it requires little base to understand some terms as some are completely unaware about itüôÉ
Both ad campaign are good üôåüòÇ like In 1st case ppl will impacted by doctors advice and in 2nd case 25% offüôÉ
Data Science:

1.excell 
2.SQL 
3.python 
4.tableue 
5.Statistics SPSS 
6.tensorflow 
7.pandas/numby  
8.IDE Jupyter
ORAGANIZING? I have so many questions.
Thanks for this straightforward and in-depth explanation! I'm a beginner in DS, and I'm looking forward to applying it in my practice as a biomedical scientist, especially with a focus on infectious diseases.
I think it's interesting that you differntiate Data Science from Statistics. I guess it's a matter of semantics but I've never heard someone else say that
You give us a clear introduction for data scientist, thanks.
great stuff! I am in the process of hopefully moving into the Data Science world for my career and your videos are huge helps in my research to learn and understand in order to make the correct decisions for myself and career. Keep them coming.
Man your voice is so so good...I mean full of confidence and energetic...I really love your voice and your valuable tips too üíØü§©
Awesome! I love its simplicity. Well done, Ken!
I am just here for the Z shirt.
Love the explanation of what DS is currently.  It feels to me like the most interesting work is where the limits of our understanding math and the limits of computing power meet, forcing innovations.

Great vid as always!
Just sent this to my brother and parents. Thanks ken :D
Thank you üôèüèΩ so helpful!
6:32 or if it was smashed or not
Really helpful even to data science aspirants. üòáüôè
great video I will kindly request to make a video of deep learning
Great vid√©o man!
Clear and i think it's a good definition :)
i want to know what are the tools they use means  did they work in jupyter notebooks or google collab in which software do they do the whole process pls reply
Hi Ken, in 4:15  of your video,  you mentioned Geography. I have basic to intermediate experience in GIS (spatial) data and geostatistics and working on improving my data wrangling, programming and ML skills in order to land a role as a geospatial data analyst/scientist. 
Thanks for this short and insightful video, I was watching your content since 2020 when started my journey in learning data analytics.
Very Well Explained, thanks Ken
Hi Ken! Great video. Can you also explain the role and responsibilites of a full stack data scientist too in one of your videos please ?
2:56 theres a typo and my dyslexic brain told me to read it as 'orgasming' data dont ask how, great video btw
Great video Ken. You got any tips on how to get on the path of learning data science?
Allow me to comment on how much I admire your relationship with your parents ‚ù§üåª ! I hope to see them reacting to one of your videos sometime Haha.
Awesome video Ken ! When my family asks what I do I'll just send them this lol .. They probably won't ask tho :3
THE EXPLANATION WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!! üôåüèº
...also... I hope it's okay... but now I'm going to drop a video next week titled: "The Only DATA ANALYTICS Explanation You Need" ü§£jk
overfitting underfitting and bias invariance tradeoff please
Great explanation!
Yes please! Explain all those topics. I‚Äôm a new to this.
Great review. I forgot a lot of these topics since it's been a while since I've been introduced to these concepts.
Would LOVE to hear the application of deep learning in DS. Right now I only hear about deep learning when it comes to voice recognition / natural language processing type of things
Ken, are you wearing a smart ring?
Monday's are always much better with a Ken Jee video!

Perfect way to start the week and great video Ken!
Papaya Easter eggs inside another great, informative video = pure genius  

Fantastic job as always.
I agree, this is the only explanatory video about data science that one needs, and yet simple and concise :)
Amazing video, very informative and well structured as always
Are data science and pizza related?
Hey Ken! I am a final year computer science student, I have started following Data science just 2-3 months back and I am intending to do a final year project on the same. The issue is that I have to learn data science from the basics, by myself, from the internet. I have only 3 and half months. Can you recommend any good course of Machine Learning with Data Science? Pretty much stressed I am!
This is an Amazing 
Data science explained so well üíØ
Really like the example used and how everything is simplified .
7:57 yes, want a video like this on deep learning. + Do you need a pretty powerful PC for deep learning?
Great message Ken! Clear and concise!
great video!
Great video, Ken! 
One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snow‚Äôs famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Before germ theory was known, it was thought that Cholera was simply in the environment and that it spread at random. John Snow conducted interviews, mapped data points and graphed the results, leading to a single water pump being identified as the culprit. This was founding moment in Epidemiology and Public Health.

Just sharing my learnings as well. Cheers :D
Oooo a lot of editing in this video üëÄ you're really making your editor work hard üòÇüòÇ, anyway great video really informative, ty for the content once again. 
Papaya bomb at 6:31
As always Ken, superbly done. Concise and brief without getting into too much jargon and getting to the pith of it.
Would love to see video on Deep Learning
This is the real truth.
Informative as usual! Really nicely explained Ken. Now I will just send this video if someone asked me to explain about Data Science
Ken this was informative, thank you. Also, I love to see the other video about regression, classification etc.
Great video as usual Ken, super well explained! happy new year üòä
Super
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know how you feel about this assessment below? Was I overly critical?
I'm addicted to this channel... Hello from Brazil
My only complaint might be that they made it too easy and the value of the cert might not be that high.
I think with ML I've had to deal with writing testing protocols for evaluating multiple kinds of protocols. That seems to be something that a lot of online courses miss
I agree with everything said in this video! Nice to see new content from you in the new year.
Great Video
My immediate reaction was "how do I know 90% of people aren't cheating on this" and that discouraged me from taking it.
One friend who‚Äôs a principal ML engineer at Kopernikus automotive told me that the best way to show your skills in ML is to have projects, products or contributing to open source.

No badges or certificates will replace that.
I was initially excited by the ML assessment, doubly so when I scored in the top 5%,  but the second that excitement wore off I realized that the assessment was too weak to mean anything. Almost as confirmation of this, a friend of mine who doesn't do Data Science or ML passed it on a whim (he then proceeded to score in the top 5% of 4 or 5 other CS related assessments). Certifications need to be *hard* in order to carry any weight, a lesson many people seem extremely reluctant to learn.
LinkedIn clout chaser badges
Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the assessment.
I give you FIVE STAR for this video . I agree with what you have said. For Corp HR who put such  rocky assessment management to do such idea in the first place. Then the question why we say degree in college or certification in boot camp created by pro in the field and not HR clerks in a corporate. Thanks.
Yea. I agree about your thoughts on the credibility of this assessment. But even as a business leader, I cannot imagine this helps either. Business leaders should understand how Machine Learning can affect their products, services, and branding. I cannot imagine that knowing what the nearest point in a K-nearest neighbor algorithm matters at all to them.
I like LinkedIn but had no idea they had an ML assessment. Thanks for sharing!
True, I have one and you're right.
Ken, Thank you for the video. I believe LinkedIn's Job Search algorithm is more optimized if one has the preferred skill badge. It helps the user find relevant companies rather than help companies find skilled applicants. Let me know if you agree. Thank you again for your videos. I really enjoy them.
Completely agree, I took this assessment applying for jobs this year, but it doesn't provide any value for people taking it or people hiring!
I did not use Google for the this assessment and got top 15%, which is great IMO.

But I do agree that terminology-based quick test is not really proof of any real-world DS/ML skill.
Assessments don't matter if no one else cares
WOWZER!
From my perspective these assessments are more for candidates than for employers. You can take test and compare your result with others. 
The questions are interesting and not trivial, about algorithms, theory, different methods. Why not. I think that coding skill is secondary.
Thanks. Your video will save many people's time. 
I wonder what will happen if your video is shared on LinkedIn lol
So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, "hey, we noticed this on your profile." They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience. 

On my main burner account, I took it to see if it's possible to cheat all the answers and it's super easy. I could give this to my sister who hates anything related to math/stats/programming, and if she googled all the questions she'd pass and get it on her profile. Definitely useless as an assessment. Nice video homie.
Hi Ken, have taken the Machine Learning assessment and passed but I never saw true value in the assessment.
I've always regarded LinkedIn assessments as "fluff."
Good points.  I do think maybe this cert could show that a manager knows what various ML terms mean, but that's about it.
Ken, hear me out on this one... The people NEED a "Ken Jee Approved for Data Science Assessment" on LinkedIn!

Now that's an assessment I (and others... I think...) would take!!!
Hey Ken! Great video! I haven‚Äôt taken the ML assessment, but did take Python and SQL quizzes. Passed both, but I believe companies shouldn‚Äôt put significant weight on LinkedIn badges. Specifically, Python and SQL assessments tested very specific knowledge that aren‚Äôt necessarily useful to me in my projects. My criticism is based on the assumption that these assessments are designed for testing someone if they are qualified to worked at LinkedIn. With that, it is a great idea if LinkedIn can add a feature for one to display their projects. After all, experience comes from practice, no :)
I completely agree. I was nervous to take the ML assessment and assumed that, if anything, my first try would just help prepare me for what specifically to study more before retaking (because with only 15 questions, how would ML "in general" be covered?) Needless to say I was shocked at how basic the assessment was (and also how poorly it represented ML concepts). The vast majority of the questions I got addressed the bias-variance tradeoff... and there were a couple of terminology questions if I remember correctly. I don't think you were overly critical at all. I think you gave some great suggestions on alternative approaches that would help tech people better showcase their skills and I'd love to see LinkedIn implement some of your ideas!
Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies. (A third might be whether a particular assessment is relevant to a particular job. Evaluating someone for a starting position versus a senior position are two slightly different things.)

Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company?

Assessments, certifications, diplomas, work experience, etc all have as much or as little weight on a resume as a particular recruiter / hiring manager applies to them.
Ken, if you've got to kiss Linkedin's ass on their crappier aspects to be a Top Voice, then we're both screwed... ü§£
LinedIn will never hire anyone based on such assessments. I guarantee if you create a fake name, resume, take the assessment and then apply to LinkedIn for a machine learning engineer position with the company. Report on the outcome, Ken.
Happy New Years Ken, first I had not heard of it, maybe I am reading this wrong, I have put considerable time into learning Data Science, which takes years not a few questions. I still  am not where I want to be, but at least I know where I am going.  You want to people to know your stuff then participate in Kaggle. Like you I like LinkedIn, but they really can do better.
I think overall, the assessments may not necessarily be a solid indicator because I could just have a second screen to google ASAP. Haha I did that for a few. Also true it would be great if you can endorse AND comment to showcase why or how someone has used a given skill.
I haven‚Äôt taken any Linkedin assessments exactly because of this reason
You are 100% correct Ken. From a this kind of assessment taking there is no value for a data science learner to improve his/her skills and no value for recruiters as well. As a learner I tried that test and only had a small enjoyment for publishing and completing some task related to data science. For true skills development or recruiting processes it doesn't give any value. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Yes, I was initially impacted by these free certification... It's a bad trap in these days... We must instantly get out of it and must empower ourselves with recognising the resources which are really valuable to learn.
I don't think I like *any* of the LinkedIn badges... I agree fully
Appreciate the honest feedback Ken!
You might have lost your chance to be selected as Top LinkedIn Voice for 2021, but you have something infinitesimally better and more important, integrity. 
#theworldneedslesssellouts.
I am commenting again because idk where my comment went
so when I first gave the ML test I passed it with flying colors but then my friend told me about this github repo that has all the answers to different linkedin assessments which made me kind of sad because that meant the assessment isn't worth much lol
Thanks. I'm not even going to try LinkedIn learning
I agree with you Ken. I haven't heard about it before and surely wasn't expecting this from LinkedIn. They should be checking practical knowledge of people considering the type of platform it is. Really poor from their side.
I love LinkedIn also and really enjoyed your constructive feedbacks. I agree that the ML assessment is really superficial and does not critically assess one's ML skill sets.
Do employers even care about these "assessments"? They don't even care about MOOC's which take up a lot more time and effort. A lot of the places I applied to made me do shitty assessments like these. One tested me on super niche Python features like wtf.
I did the R assessment a while back. The questions were not very relevant to my experience. It might be better now.
Took it and got the badge
LinkedIn has been game changer for many people and also me but I agree that linkedin has pros and cons and i think there assesment is not something we should relive on üíØ.

And I totally agree with Ken that badges and Certificate won't get you job üôå
Ken sensei restoring my self-esteem after closing the R assessment halfway Haha .. If it wasn't titled R assessment I wouldn't have known it was for R lol
It's just not data science assessment, all other assessments are same.
Spot on !
I took it. I passed it. I passed a bunch of other assessments. The Python one for example and they're all pretty bad.
Terminology is pretty silly I feel like. Business Value > Everything
LinkedIn is so great at some things and so bad at other things.
First like ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
(Reminder that all resources I mentioned are linked in the description!)
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know what your goals for this year are below! Mine Are:
- Do a project with a  Generative Adversarial Neural Net
- Enter at least 1 Kaggle Competition 
- Do at least 4 projects and share them on YouTube
thaks
Hey! Thanks for explaining everything so much in detail, just the video I was looking for. 
How much is leetcode & DSA required for a junior Data Scientist position? Thanks.
I have a question what can i get a job withou DS diploma since i am self taught?
Enrolled into data science program from recommendation. Trying to understand but impossible to do so. Wish i an go back time and start from data analytic first
I just finished and submitted my first submission to a Kaggle competition and am learning python on Kaggle. My goals are to create a more optimized algorithm and learn python and basics of data science
Thanks Ken. This was very helpful.
I'm currently learning Data Analytics to transition into ML engineering within 2 years according to my plan because I heard that ML engineering is not an entry level job and I need to be either in software development, mathematics, or data related fields to get in. I'm wondering if I can accomplish that while having no degrees in CS or Mathematics whatsoever and with just online cources and project creation. Please, give me your insight.
Is it only me or who smoothly finished math n stats for ds and is haunted by python
Great video. Picked up some tips even as a masters graduate still refining my craft.
https://youtu.be/OZ3RVtH-iU8
https://youtu.be/OZ3RVtH-iU8
Looked at several analyst roles in business such as those related to sales in Insurance companies and retail, they dont seem to require python at all or that much.  Whats used is Excel, Tableau / Power BI and if more advanced SQL. Why the focus on Python and R when these roles are likely to be those used extensively not by analysts but senior level Data Scientists? Is this the standard in Tech or Big Tech FAANG roles? It appears for a lot of companies these higher skill roles are not used in their daily usage of data for analyst positions in their actual work. Maybe its an HR thing requiring higher skill levels on paper like requiring an MS for junior data analyst roles, tsk...
does the 365 course focus on parallel project making too? I must say it looks very appealing if it does, pls let me know! 
‚ô•
Great content!! Thanks a lot !!!
Everytime I watch your videos I feel a little gentle push telling me I can do this and equipping me with all the tools mentally and physically. Thank you Ken. I always have new found confidence and a new way of thinking of things after watching your videos.  üòä
Hey Guys I am new

What is the difference between a Data Scientist and a Data Engineer
Great Video! Thanks Ken!
Hey!!! Sir ken  i am 27 years old can i kknow learn  data science
I am currently a Firefighter/Paramedic and am completely over the job. It‚Äôs time for a switch to better provide for my family and live a better life. Does anyone have an opinion on Practicum‚Äôs boot camps?
Thank you very much Ken. You are the man! Dude. I have a quick question about my situation. I am an Economist and I want to learn Data Science to excel in the Economic research or Market research and related data analysis. I have learnt Statistics in depth and Maths in not a barrier as well. Would you suggest me a roadmap that I can work on. Right now I am not doing career job but I want to switch asap.
Thanks again
Aggghh! I miss Oahu
Great Video! I stumbled upon your profile through Stefanovic > Luke Barousse to you. I have done a bachelor's in mining engineering and have been working as project manager for various IT relevant projects of mining provincial sector of Pakistan for more than 7 years now. Now I have picked up DS as my major for masters as I have been linked with IT and data for quite some time now. I have started learning Python and have gotten admitted in a master's program in DS starting Feb 2023. I am planning to follow your 66DaysofData challenge too to start my new journey. DS is quite overwhelming, but your videos make it sound intriguing and adventurous. 
I am switching my field from mining engineer to project manager to a data scientist now. Please share your insights on switching careers to DS and having any age limitations (if any) when it comes to getting rewarding projects and jobs relevant to DS.
Want to learn
1. intro to programming
2. python
3. Projects
üòÖüòä
thank you  for  Realistic words about  learning process Data science.I immense me  to  follow you day by  day  for  self  growth  towards Data Science
Thank you!  Great place for me to get started!!!
inspirational framework
my main issue is: I work on making reports on excel. Right now i am embarking on a big one-man project to make more reports on excel. Completely on my own, I am the only report making guy on my team.
I keep thinking "I bet I could do this better if i was a programmer", but I just... keep finding solutions to my problems in excel. And just keep default-ing to excel time and time again. My motivation to wanna learn to program is this blurry idea of "I bet a programmer could do this better", but my concrete idas of what i wanna do I always find a way to make it work on excel, I am very create on my problem solving in excel.
But I don't wanna stay in excel. I know progress will crush me, I will become obsolete, any minute now. I need to move forward and learn proper data science. I just struggle to get motivated cuz all my projects end up working just in excel.
Brilliant video, very clear and concise Thank you üôåüèΩ Sub!
Is it advisable to learn data engineering for data science?
Good video
Sir can we become a data scientist or analyst with majors in mathematics or statistics, or do we need a computer science degree?
How or where does a career like this tie into healthcare?  Specifically,  surgery?  Surgery of any specialty?  Or the functioning patterns of operating rooms?  I have worked in surgery for 26yrs. I want a career change. And I think my past experiences and knowledge can help some where.
I'm pivoting to data analysis/ science and my passion is Supply Chain & Logistics (and more broadly Industrial Systems). This road map was super helpful. Thank you!
365 data science or datacamp?
The hardest thing for me is knowing when I've learned enough to actually get a decent job where I'm not starting back from the bottom. I started my career as engineer doing predictive health monitoring for aircraft components and picked up some basic machine learning regressions with matlab's toolboxes. Then I got really heavy into statistics and got my six sigma black belt to help with R&D and process monitoring of additive manufacturing. On the side, I started using Python to build a few different helpful models, but the main one has been a motocross/supercross race result predictor that uses xgboost and the bradley-terry model; I post the results as a way to bring people to my side hustle's site to buy other products; the model does really well. With all that, I still find myself uncertain when looking around at jobs
I‚Äôm pretty much a blank canvas at this point and feel like I am on something of a time crunch. I‚Äôve been able to learn pretty quickly with what I have researched, but I feel like I‚Äôm learning any other language in the wrong way. It‚Äôs one thing to know how to say ‚Äúthe dog walked to the park‚Äù in a random language. It‚Äôs another thing entirely to express my own thoughts in said language. I could learn the grammar and the words by reading, but I would only become able to read it at best. I need hands on projects to work on. Not only to help me learn but to create a portfolio.
my Roadmap:
python
Kaggle project learning by imitation
learning math concepts while doing projects
Learning algorithms after learning probablity
start doing my own kaggle projects based on random datas i get 
practice projects untill excellent progression nearing perfection
take up either sql or image processing or probably cryptography??
quite easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer randomly spread out topics choosing what to learn very superficial and what to master
As someone with an artistic background and amateur interest in many scientific fields, am I totally off-piste with looking into Data Science if I'm interested in moving towards a path of focusing on the visualization of different data sets? Is what I envision even a thing? lol. Any advice appreciated
Totally new to data science, have not even started learning anything as yet- reason why I watched your video. Ps very enjoyable. Hereafter, I'll remember what you said: write down my goals, but keep evolving them as I learn
What an amazing and helpful video!!! Thanks a lot dear Ken
Thank you, Ken! Very helpful)
Hi Ken, kudos for you clearness about how to get started with data science! 
How about the age to start with? 
Do you think that middle age people (40's) who come frome a very different environment (let's say life sciences for example, with 0 maths or statistics) are capable of begining the journey and landing a data science job without spending many years to be ready to apply for one?
really great video. Im now addicted to his sexy voice
really great video. Im now addicted to his sexy voice
Ken, I keep coming back to this video, not only for the excellent advice on both the learning path and the learning mindset to have, but to the beautiful scenic drone and Go Pro-type footage. It's such a beautiful tropical place. Where is it?
I am just researching this subject and trying to understand.... What I learned is Data Analytics gradually merges into Data Science the more you incorporate probablity/statistics and math algorithms....   Does that sound accurate?   So get a solid foundation in Data Analytics first . It will be your strong foundational base.
Data science is a practice, but there are some concepts you need to learn to just get started. Reminds me of that famous saying " How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice practice Practice."
appreciate it :)
actually, it mitigate a little bit my anxiety in terms of "OMG I need to learn ML within very close future, but I'm under ground zero level"
yeah, so first goal is the ground zero, next 1st flor but in the middle aprox 20 smaller stair steps
but most important is to DO it in endless itterations :D
how much do you earn per project on average ? and how much time does one spend on a project?
Does Data science includes machine learning??
Thank you Ken. Great advice!
Love these videos. You can make new version of these info videos every year and always be relevant. üëèüëèüëè
Hii! I'm looking for a little guidance
I took a bachelor's degree in mathematics and my current goal is to become a data scientist
In my 1st semester I learnt the python basics
A few months ago I had an internship as a data scientist where I did a classification project (in Python) and I just loved it. However, my coworkers knew little to no Python and only worked in SAS or R
Now, in my 6th semester, I learnt C (for an algorithms and data structures class), SQL (for a databases class) and some R (for applied statistics)
I love to programme and therefore I'm thinking of, in the future, going more into the computer science field but for now I would like to progress as a data scientist. Any advice you (Ken or anyone) have on what steps I can take next? I know Ken has a ton of advice videos but I feel like I have a very particular case and would love to hear some opinions and other's experiences
Reeatching 5 months later. I failed to learn python/pandas. Can I change for R? I try to start a few days ago, looks good to me.
Ken, to be honest, I prefer Java for programming. I am a computer science student. I use Linux and just open source software, I recuse pirate software.
Thank you for sharing your precious experience with us. I wanted to ask if there is any age barrier for working in the field of data science, is there any limitation for getting recruited as a data scientist ?!
My four years old boy made me write this :  why you have that dinosaure lamp on your desk?!
Thank you for this video, Ken. New Sub, aspiring Data Analyst. Will binge watch your vids. üòÄ
Thank you for sharing your experience! I just got an internship to be trained as a data analyst and learning Data Science basics. I felt so lost as a person in their mid-thirties feeling like my previous Psychology BS degree with English/Math minor was worthless. Your video has given me hope that I can obtain this knowledge with a bit of planning and goals.
thank you multiverse Ken...
I don‚Äôt know why you put turquoise water clips in between your sentences but for some reason I like it so much!ü§©
currently 16 and will be breaking into this field with 0 knowledge of it all. all i have is my computer, a pencil, a notebook, and the internet to help me get started. love that people offer these services for free.
Thanks a lot. I decided to go with the Google Data Analytics
I'm currently on week two of the Google Data Analytics course
Your donation towards my certification is highly appreciated here>>https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DZ7W3VEXS3L98
thanks for the valuable wisdom
Brilliant! I wish I had seen this when you posted this. So many great resources! Thank you for sharing. Definitely subscribed!
Path‚Ä¶
1. Coding (Python)/ SQL
2. Do projects on Kaggle 
3. Learn Statistics  
4. Learn algorithms (classification, regression)
5. Do projects again‚Ä¶ (start from interesting projects and goes towards complicated projects )
6. Deep learning (computer vision) >> depends on interest
7. Projects projects projects
Very informative indeed.thank you so much
"We also get mentally tired" > so true
Hi Ken jee    . 
 if i want to switch into Data science then should i keep fake experience or can i go like  fresher ? coz currently iam working as software tester.
Hey Ken, Thanks a lot for the video.
Of all the confusion which now seems to be a bit clear of what I need to learn, the challenge now is to manage time along with work & prioritize the learnings as couple of things are needed parallelly. Example: Planned on learning Advanced SQL | Python for DS & if I want to build projects it's a bit of challenge when working a full time job. 

I kind of know the answer that It's my life & I am the one to sort it but, just sharing as I am going off the track sometime by doing nothing.
Can I learn python on a iPad or do I need a actual Microsoft laptop
I'm learning Python 3 and i've reached a peak on the OOP part. Someone told me that i shouldn't wait to learn all of it, but to stop where i am and yo start learning sql now. How do i know the point where is enough to go to the next thing?
Thank you so much specially for putting this video out.
Look to use data science for privet equity. Has anyone have advice
Thank you for your kind words for how to start on the path of data science. Glad to say I had already a list of short course and webinars I have completed and a list of one's I wish to advance up too. I to completely agree on what I call ' cut and paste and make it my own' version of projects in python. After doing a very poor course in  python I stumbled my way through to taught myself by doing just as you said in your video, that opening a screen and just typing it out and running it. I am visual person so makeing it my own by styling was how I learnt the best. Loving the colour or direction of xlable I could control, my understanding and interest peaked. This then grew into wanting to graph better results, more complicated, while, ifs, else all started to become tools. Now seeing the hurdles at the start to the hurdles I over came I'm so proud to complete my course as I know I can build from this, I never know it but I know I can do it... Reminds me of cooking when I first left home, you just keep getting better the more you try and read up on it.  If your at the start of your data career good luck.
‚ÄúLearning Data Science is a lifelong journey.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄîWhat a great quote I've heard for today
I have serious issues with self-learning new stuff from scratch (org skills, procrastination, concentration, motivation etc.). Would you then rather recommend doing a 2-year long MSc. in Data Science (part-time, with intro semester with all basic stuff, such as Python, statistics, math etc.), or attending a part-time bootcamp for 9-12 months (I have a BSc. in Urban Planning, so not really someone from the field...)? The MSc. would be a couple of K Euros cheaper than the boot camps (I'm in Europe). Thx!!
like your voice
I watched the video so many times to stay motivated.
2 months since I started, hope I can jump into doing my own projects soon.
As a non-science background how can I start? I am overwhelmed by lots of resources.
Very informative! Thank you
Hi! I just got accepted to ucla for data theory major(transfer). I leaned c++ in community college and have little bit of computer science background. Do you think it is better to go to grad school to become data scietist? I‚Äôll self-teach python before I attend ucla.
7:13¬†u made a mistake the probability theory lol
Thank you Ken!
Hi Ken Jee,

Hope you're doing well! Would appreciate your thoughts when you have a free moment.

I am in the US, NYC area, looking to dabble in Data Analysis specifically for applying to Financial Planning 
Specifically for visualizing data and using Data, Factor Analysis similar to PortfolioVisualizer when looking at stock market return data series, with the longer-term goal of eventually simulating systematic stock market factor-investing strategies. 

I already have a strong understanding of the Finance Theory behind these quant strategies, however, I don't have knowledge of the Ddta side. I'd like to acquire that knowledge in order to apply it in my own projects and in mimicking others'.

Can you provide some direction?
My current assumption is that R would possibly be more suited and in demand than Python for my specific industry. Unfortunately I'm not sure what specific topics I would want to investigate in order to gradually expand what I can analyze within stock market data.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance!
This is how all videos should be, helpful and wholesome. Thank you.
Hello Ken, thanks for your video! It‚Äôs really informative. I have some questions though. Will you consider R as a coding skill? I started learning coding through R, I learnt a bit of Python but I use it when necessary. So R becomes my ‚Äòfirst language‚Äô when comes to writing scripts. Would this drive me far if I continue doing data science-related work? Or should I start transitioning into using Python?
one thing I love about computer science in general is that you don‚Äôt stop learning but advancing your skills and knowledge
Great video. Thank you.
Hey Ken, thanks for this video! I have a question though: how do I learn the math part? Are there any courses for that? I already have a background in coding
I always had that one question in my mind,  i have so many sources to learn data science from YouTube, websites , apps further more.... I stuck in this infinity loop .. Do i need to select one particular source ?? Or learn flexibly??
Hey Ken i am engineering college student just asking if 1.5 hours daily is ok or should I have to spend time daily? BTW your video was very helpfull for me who is just starting to learn data science.
Nice video!
Pretty sure the lots focus at 4:35 is intended :p
This has helped me tremendously! I'm a database coordinator and I feel so clueless at times because I don't know enough about this subject. I will definitely take your advice about setting smaller goals. At first, my goal was to take all of these courses, get certified and that would be it. But, now I know that this is a process and learning data science is continuous. I now have a more clearer picture of what my path should look like. Thank you so much! You just gained a sub!
Agree on Pandas. To be effective at getting value out of data, it seems (to me anyway) that learning what Pandas can do is more beneficial than learning to create your own (likely worse) implementation. 

I spent a summer internship doing poorly what I could have done much more easily and robustly if I looked into what I could do with pandas. 

But I came from a background of c++ courses in college, and was not used to the approach of learning to effectively use tools that were out there for the public like pandas.
Is Datacamp OK to learn also?
I've already subscribed to their courses
This is such solid advice for a complete newbie like me. I‚Äôll start looking at the resources you‚Äôve provided. Thank you!
Sir can you tell me how can i find any website data
I want to become a data scientist working in the finance domain (I am not sure which division specifically for now, but I am sure its in the finance space). I know the basics of python for data science (pandas, numpy, etc) and I have done a few projects on kaggle. However, I am going to soon pursue a masters in data science and I am worried about the math. How much math is really required for data science? Intuitively, I understand why statistics plays a big role, but what about linear algebra and calculus? Like, how much of those do you need and what specific topics / learning objectives should you know before you can confidently say they are sufficient? (Sufficient to be a data scientist)

Also - I understand that data science is a huge field and different parts of data science requires different skillsets, but I am looking to be right in between data analysis and machine learning. I am very much interested in machine learning, but then again, i don't want to go too deep into it considering my calculus isn't as strong. 

Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you for your time in advance!
First suggestion was spot on!!!!
Sound is not working
Everyone: SQL is easy
Job: "A thousand subqueries descend upon you..."
Very informative and clear video..thanks Ken Jee..
What would be your advice to someone who has no tech experience at all but who want to get into data science/data analyst?
I would be interested in what can I do to continue learning Data Science. Because I am not beginner by any measure; I've finished BS in General Math (and tried to focus on stats and data science at the time), I've had job directly connected to data science and am doing data science in my current job. But it makes it harder to progress, because now, while you do know something (basic math, basics of Python, scikit, numpy, pandas, basic ML knowledge...) there is so much more you don't know, and it's not at all clear where to go from now...
I like this years ken! ;)
Hey ken
I was wondering what you thought about data science being more automated in recent times with data iku and if you think it is still a career worth pursuing.
I've been learning ML every day for 10 hours. Everythink will be ok
Hi Ken, I have been lost not knowing what to do with my life. I have always be leaning towards coding and business but had difficulty combining both. Imagine the relieve I felt when I learnt about data science. I am just beginning my journey and am grand I have somewhere to seek guidance. Thank you
Great video! Seems like a very sensible roadmap for becoming a good data scientist. I'm here to comment because you said 6+ months to learn and I came to this video because I've only got a few days. I've got part-way through a recruitment process to be a data scientist and have a background only in maths and economics. I'm teaching myself python and SQL in about 4 days! Kaggle seems like an excellent resource to use on the fourth day, didn't know about it until watching this video. I hope this comment gives people a small chuckle at the task I've found myself with!
Nice vid, bro 
Thanks
Is it ok to start with R?
The picketry of Facebook has been making us all worried all the time. Maybe Mark E Zuckerberg wants falafel, maybe he wants hummus, and maybe he wants it home made and not gigged up by a chef who he takes on rent in his house to cook. We want our worries that we are constantly being pick pocketed within our pocket to stop.
Thanks for that push Ken
What else should you be doing while learning on 365 Datascience?Once you finish on 365 Datascience what should you be doing to strengthen your skills or build your portfolio for companies you‚Äôre applying to.
I don't mind it, and I know you're not gonna change the whole vid- but theres a small typo @7:16 where you type out "probalitiy theory"  and i thought it was funny. Some data might show you get more comment engagement on videos with obvious typos üìä
I started to read the book "Introduction to Data Science", from Spring. 
And, also, the pandas documentation. Besides, i think pandas documentation a little confuse.
I struggled to learn python and now I learning pandas
I strongly recommend Think Big: Take Small Steps and Build The Future You Want by Dr Grace Lordan. A great book to chart your own successful career, be it a data science career or any other career. It gives you a wider perspective on the activities you want to do in your life and career.
Hii i have a doubt i want to learn ML so that i can use it in robotics so should I start with learning linear regression or I can start from learning computer vision and deep learning
My goal is money ... and I think Data Science will give me a decent pathway to that. I'm about more than halfway done with Machine Learning algorithms (Decision trees ,random Forest and Reinforcement algorithms left ). I looked into overview of deep learning neural networks and luckily they don't require trigonometry which just makes it a bit less than hard for me to complete it. Now I need to put those daily hours before I earn those bug bucks.
This may be an interesting question. For elder professionals who know they are good in learning skills, the question is:-  Is being a data scientist, may not be in sync of growing from a management role perspective or even becoming an entrepreneur? Thanks
Is it a good idea to pursue masters degree in data science course?
Great so you have a degree in mathmatics in order to learn data science.
Thanks a lot for a fantastic video.
I am looking forward to beginning this journey.
Hi Ken, thank you for great video. I'd like to ask question about people who are more analytical than others. i do believe that there are 10% people out there that have better understanding of let's say statistics or probability and related stuff. I have experienced it by myself too that some of my groupmates are more robust in these areas and can get problem solved more easily. Do not really know whether it is related to background or innate skills, always feel like they must be guys for data science not me). I'd like to know your approach as expert in this field.
So I have decided that 2022 will be the best year of my life. I've started learning Python on 1st day of the year and up till now I have covered most of the basics and made some simple programs as well in last 20 days. So far it's going good. Thank you for this video. I wanted to ask, when should I start practicing on Kaggle now? I Study around 1-2 hours daily after my job and 3-4 hours on weekends...
Thanks for this video Ken.

I decided to go into Tech in 2018 by learning web development. Learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goals has since evolved through this period as I got interested in python programming and Data science.

My current interest now tends towards deep learning and AI

Interesting my knowledge of front end web development will be very helpful in web scraping.
Hello ken jee!!! I'm doing a graduation on Computer Science and i really keen to learn Data Science. From where should i start? learning Python basics? If you have any resources of learning Python, could you help me providing the link? To be honest my excitement to learning data science get on the top notch after watching your this video. üòÑ
Great video!!! I started learning Python 8 months ago and quickly became interested in DS, I have a background in Finace/Econ but never worked in finance (I have a construction business), my goal is to learn DS and work with investments. Having said all that im considering a boot camp and even a masters in DS, I would love to get your opinion on that. Thanks
Watching this for a second time while working out because, well, I'm a huge geek and a fanboi.
thank you for the high quality videos
Is it realisable to apply deep learning on a real project after four months starting from scratch in this field ?
great video, thanks for advice!
How about don't learn data science lol. I'm sorry but the only benefit is that it pays REALLY well. It lacks creativity, is stressful because of the pressure that corporations put on your utilitarian "skills" you bring to the table to asses and translate data. Its a hard job. I'd pass.
What about PySpark? Does it also make sense to pay attention to it? And what could be a possible private project example?
I like how he says algorithm and techniques in 6:50 and show us the descending  slope. As if  he were referring to gradient descent. ?üòÑ
Yes, I agree I will watch you üòé again!
its all about Doing projects, projects and Projects..........
Hi Sir , currently i am pursuing my 3rd years of bachelor's degree in cse. Due to covid and many other reasons , it will take more time than expected to complete my bachelor's degree. 
So is it possible that if I  start learning data science from scratch (which i am doing right now) and then get a job in data science field before completing my bachelor's degree in cse?
second question is can I apply for a master's degree on data science or related field while doing my bachelor's degree?
Thanks in advance
First time to your channel Great advice thank you. I am going to start with all the points you said..  Right video at the right time :)
Thank you for all the information that you share. I've spent several months considering the proper career switch after deciding not to return to medical school. At this point, I'm confident that data science is the proper career path. My overarching goal is to use data science in healthcare, but I am open to other fields. I found your channel today, and I want to say I am already grateful for your content and the resources you share. In addition to this video, I watched a video this evening in which you mentioned that Jan 4 is your bday. Happy Belated Birthday. May you continue to experience joy and success.
Watching it again and starting to think if my struggling to learn python and pandas as well itnis not impatiance? Yes, at little.
This video is extremely accurate. I have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist. I am in a MS in Data Analytics program and feel that doesn't really provide any real direction. I don't know what I don't know and that keeps me from learning what I need to know. Seeing the path helps, thank you. I would like to say I have struggled to learn R and I seem to be getting SQL quickly and I think this will help my confidence. Getting one language down can help to learn another, just from a confidence standpoint.
Hi Ken, thank you for your videos. I have a question, I am software developer with 8 years experience. Mostly Web, PHP, SQL, GO, I decided to start learning machine learning, here is a lot of Python and so on, what do you think if person like me, firstly, will change position to data analyst and continue to learn ML ? Is it right decision ? Thank you.
Very helpful‚Ä¶ Been thinking a career move to Data Science and your video is all I needed.
Thank you so much
What are your thoughts on Datacamp?
I am learning how to build predictive models by watching videos and working alongside on another screen.  It's really satisfying to see your code work.  Especially when you start to experiment with your own parameters.  Why do you think Python is more important to learn than R?  Is it more versatile? I'm learning both, I'm just curious what you think.
Hey, I have started my journey on learning data science. And, the math is what I find the most overwhelming, so much that I almost dropped the idea but curiosity gets the better of me and keeps on track. Being from non CS background, I feel really lost and tired when it comes to mathematics involved. 

Could you please share the maths topics and their sub topics that I should focus on and get as proefficient in it. I will be absolutely grateful if you get a chance to share the same and if any resources that I should refer to.
Hi Ken, how are you? Hope fine.
So, I am returning to college this year. I am going back to computer science. I am studying Java because of that.
And because I was struggling to learn python, my godness! I try every possible way, then I turn out to python official documentation. I achieve a more cleary glimpse of what is python, but nothing too much practical. I found a guy, corey schaffer, he is really didatic. 
My goal, for this month, is start a small data science project for a local market here where I live. I already have SQL, MySQL, AWS basics and a solid background in maths and stathistics. I think i can do it. If don't, the lesson will be learned. You know.
So, thank you for your advice.
You earned new subscriber. Love your encouragement for people like me. I did installed Python last year but stuck on where to start cuz I dunno what specific purpose. Since I wanna do my PhD related to AI (predictive model), should I learn the whole coding of python or only focus related to AI coding?
As I learnt python. I was working on projects from kaggle with a  problem Statement. I was searching different data exploration techniques.
You explained it clearly I love the way you teach.
I am following you learning strategie.
Thank you
Good video.
Thanks Ken, I took off with python basis last two years, within the space of 2 months, I was already in Pandas, and doing the Jupyter thing. Anyways everything poured on my face, and I just gave up. With this video I saw my mistakes. Roadmap. Starting with the basis and mastering them. Then you proceed. Spend as much time as you want to learn the basis. When your is strong, your building will last forever. Thanks again Ken.

üá≥üá¨
Hi, your paid link does not work!
Hi Ken,

For the 365 Data science website you recommend, is there any certification given after completion of the course?

Also is the certificate recognized?
I really appreciate the advices! ;-]
Hi Ken! This is AWESOME - I've been a Data Scientist for a few years now and completely agree about constantly needing to learn and refresh the data science toolkit. I didn't start out working on ML models but my work led there over time and had to learn on the job. Just joined the #66DaysOfData challenge and discord for Day 1, really excited to dedicate time to explore the field more. Thanks so much!
Eligible for entry level job
Hi, What about SQL before Python?
Hey Ken! Thanks for the vid, man! Looking forward to beginning my Data Science Journey in 2022! You'll be seeing me throughout the year.
Lovely learning map, Ken ! 
And yes 4:30 math is very important ^^
Love your channel and your content, keep it up.
Hey everyone, I just uploaded my first ever video, which is a Day in the Life of a Computer Science student. Please check it out when you get a chance. I'll be posting content regularly going forward. Hopefully it's beneficial to anyone who is currently a CS student, a prospective CS student who is looking for insight, or others who just want to see some more CS content. Learn from my mistakes and let's learn together along the way 
https://youtu.be/izKFglRZKYE

Ken, your video is super informative! Thanks for the pointers. I'm think I'm headed towards the data science route, so this was very helpful and I look forward to watching your other vids and future content. :)
Boss Ken..
6months on the go...
I consider I'm a good learning path.
I'm starting with statistics (19hrs tutorial video), then I will take up math to Excel/python...

Thank you for this
Hi, I'm a uni student majoring in business analytics. Because my school doesn't have a program that is "data analytic". If I only have two years left of college life. Is it possible to enter the data field? Btw, I like this video.
This is a great video. Thank you. I needed it.
How long will the 365 discount last? IS it only for the holiday or is it like a affiliate/code thing?
Been waiting for this video!!!!

To anyone reading this, if you're looking to break into Data Science in 2022 I 100% recommend subscribing to Ken's channel and following his advice!!

Back when COVID-19 started in 2020, I was looking to break into the field and I had no experience, no projects, and I didn't know where to start.

6 MONTHS after subscribing to Ken's channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos, I got a job as a Data analyst.

I'm living proof that this channel is 100% all that you need to get started. Thank you Ken and & I can't thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me.
The only question I got is do we need a traditional degree to get in that domain? I'm a finance grad. Idk if I'd be eligible for a masters program in data science so how do I do it? Cause I don't think employers recognise anything other than degrees.
Do you need a masters degree?? Cos it seems a lot of people are running to data science and AI masters programs
Congrats Ken!!! I loved this video! Especially the roadmap on how to learn Data Science üìç
It's that time of year again...."If I had to start over"  videos are coming
Ken,i really lack from the maths side of things,what books/ressources do you recommand ?
when you realize 2022 is pronounced as "2020 too"
Thanks, Ken. I have started learning myself Data Science, fortunately, I have a programming/math background. and so far I have found the going reasonable all though it is an effort in time. My question is this is there a place for a part-time / freelance Data Scientist? I find the field extremely interesting but I doubt if that is all I want to do. Also, do you know if c++ is still used in Data Science? Kind regards
Watched just right now, but worth it.
I want to entry in data science because I like to solve problems driven by data. I like to see the variables of a problem in the reality and reach a solution; solve real-world problems. This is something that I couldn't do with enginnering; college was a really frustation. But there I heard of 'data science' for the very first time and learn stathistics.
I trying to enter in this field in a self paced manner. Already study python documentation, trying pandas documentation. Anyway... I hope the year ahead will be better.
Great video Ken!  I will be sharing with my incoming students this semester!
hey tech algorithm
I used your project-based learning approach from last year's video to learn data science. After 15 months and 700 hours of learning (no online courses, just individual studying), I landed as job as a mid-level data scientist in financial fraud detection. Thank you! This video is spot-on. Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills.
How hard is it to get job without master's degree??
I had one question in regards with DS that is, is 2022  the best time to move into it especially since its been a "hyped" job for about past 3-4 years won't there be a high barrier to entry ?
What are your thoughts about the IBM and Google Data Science Certificates - good if you can afford it?
Thanks for the recommendations Ken! I am always updating my learning path to include new things or based in things I enjoyed the most, for example making a deeper dive in data visualization.
What happened with the editing? There is a frame mirrowed in minute 5:52. Your desk is in the other side of the room.
Thanks again for the amazing content!
can you make a video about new techniques you learned this year? there arent really resources on i guess "advanced" data science
by the way, most data science college courses are fucking awful. take them for the credibility, but use Kaggle Learn and personal projects to actually learn things
Excellent Vid! Im gona follow this . Be back in 2022
I‚Äôve been waiting all year for this! üôåüèº Solid advice Ken!
hey ken! i'm a freshman double majoring in cs and stats - also pursuing a data science-related career. just thought you should know that i as a college student find your channel extremely insightful and valuable. wishing the best for you and your content coming into 2022 :>
My goals this year is to complete the 365 data science course, I have been doing it since past couple of weeks, so I have gained the momentum, now just need to be consistent. Apart from that, I will try to do as many projects as I can and start freelancing in late 2022
I'm ready for the ultra sequel "How I would learn data science if I had to start over (if I died and re-spawned in my next life as an alien)"
rip physical muscles I guess
What is a good DS project involving a clothing boutique store. I live in a small town and been trying to think of good projects. It seems for a boutique regression and clustering comes to my mind.
"Stay True to the process" .. You told me this last year which really stuck to my head and helped me get my recent job üåª Excited to be doing more projects and learn from/with u
I wonder if ken changed his mic recently, his voice is.. how do I describe it?.. more satisfying? Ken ASMR when?
All of them are such great advice. Thanks for the inspiring ideas. üòä Furthermore, I completely agree with you about data science is a journey.üöÄ
Hey Ken why don't you join youtube as developer and do coding. Make that link box appear on left side so you don't have to mirror your video.XD
Thank you so much!
Hey Ken.
What do you think about the Open Source Society University's self taught data science curriculum?
I'm just starting my Junior year in college and wanted to start learning data science.
Very Super Nice video .. Big thanks Champ üí™üîù
Speaking of goals, it would be cool to see a TOP Goals video, etc.
Congrats and thanks Ken! Happy new year to you, as much like you made my last year.
You are helping people man, keep the vibe! Respect from Brazil! :D
If I were relearn data science in 2022, I'd start by subscribing to your channel haha but in practicality it is:
1. Coursework 
2. Projects 
3. Teach

Also great motivational video for simple content creation during break!
Really love how it will add up to previous video on this topic üíØ
Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.
Thanks for the insights ken, do you think cloud computing skills (AWS, azure etc..) is necessary for the data science journey.
Excelente video Ken. Yo llevo 9 meses aprendiendo ciencia de datos y es una profesi√≥n incre√≠ble. Me siento muy feliz de haber aprendido sobre esto. El pr√≥ximo a√±o mi meta es tener un nivel B1 de ingles y usare tus videos para lograrlo. ¬°Muchas gracias!
Ken, what I have found is all these online projects / learnings mostly gives 10 variables and ask to predict a 11th one. But in the real world it‚Äôs very difficult to goto that level of identifying a problem and later identifying a approach to solver a problem . Until now I have not seen any course teaching that. Your advice on this ?
Do you have a Udemy course?
Thanks a lot, some of us have only just started using python properly the last few months and videos like this are very useful
"When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can  experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go."

This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on.

thanks Ken Jee, it really helps me out.
Awesome!! This is really helpful. Thanks
Let's accept KEN is the BEST ü•≥
This updated video is epic. Your pioneering "If I had to start over" video had inspired so many similarly named videos in the tech youtube space. Certainly agree with you on the importance of coding and how that opened up several doors of opportunities in accessing "power tools" for the data science learning journey. 
8:01 Also thanks for the mention üòÜ
Excellent video to watch at 5am!
I agree it takes up to a year to get the fundamentals. Then you basically never stop learning.
Happy new year! Thanks for all the videos and the community you have created!
Hi sir
(Reminder that all resources I mentioned are linked in the description!)
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know what your goals for this year are below! Mine Are:
- Do a project with a  Generative Adversarial Neural Net
- Enter at least 1 Kaggle Competition 
- Do at least 4 projects and share them on YouTube
Thanks for watching everyone! I'd love to hear about your experience with WSL 2 or how you would use it in your workflow! 
If you want to check it out yourself, you can do so here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
Wsl2 is garbage for every day use as is wsl1 from a software engineering standpoint
Hey, nice content, thanks a lot. By the way, which monitor are you using, if I may ask ? :)
I remember in 2018, i was working on one my project and i need GPUss for that. My Prof. bought me HASEE Kingbook laptop (So very nice of him) but the problem was that, despite my earnest effort i couldnt install Ubuntu on it because of hardware incompatibility. It tried many means to overcome that like using VM etc. but i couldnt, as they dont support GPUs. If they had released WSL2 at that time, a lot of my problems would have been solved. ALASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS..........

Still KUDOS to Microsoft to be lenient about their UNIX systems policy and start developing such amazing tools.
does it work via Windows VPN? is it fast accessing Windows files?
My general setup is to run Linux on bare metal and windows in a VM. One thing WSL 2 offers is the ability to share the gpu. that's a pretty big win. I wish there was a way to do the same with Linux as the host OS
Love the way! You will also love if you know how wsl2 works behind the hood.
Do we need qualys in WSL2 application in Windows Laptop?
Nice in the future support for Mac os will be added
Why don't you just use linux as your OS?
Have been using it a bit and so far everything works perfectly!
Hi, Ken. How would you set up the environment in WSL? would you recommend installing Anaconda in WSL?
Is WSL 2, or just linux in general, something I should be familiar with before getting my first job as a data scientist?  What resources should I use to learn?
Literally hit it on the nail for me. Combining BI tools on Windows and my Data Science work on Linux will be huge for me!
I started using WSL since the last 5 months, it's really handy!
Booting process is sometimes very boring... This is a best way üôå
I am a huge fan of WSL2. It make it easier to have one machine to do everything locally.
WSL 2 on my Dell Laptop with a Ryzen 5 chip was a huge headache. 
Constant Blue Screens of Death. 
Total waste of time.
Nice
I don't know what magic WSL2 uses, but it can consume up to 5.5 gigs of RAM of my 7 avaliable (1 gig is allocated to intergated GPU as VRAM). Can you even imagine launching virtual machine which can consume 80% with 1.5 gigs remained for host system?
Wsl consumes so much ram, just open a  very small react app with vs-code running with wsl-remote-extension and it  
uses 1.7 GB of ram. I have 8Gigs on my laptops and with running wsl it literally uses 85% of ram, and also got the BSOD multiple times. So Disappointed !
Would love to know the specs of a machine that can handle these!
Hey Ken? Just a heads up, I will be using your LinkedIn profile in a motivational YouTube video w/ basketball theme to motivate LinkedIn professionals optimize their LinkedIn profile. :)
D-did Ken cheat on Papayas with Persimmon ? I guess there's room for both of them now with WSL 2 :3
Is it possible to have GUI with wsl2?
Oh I thought it would be a cat pot which I must say has changed my life. BUT DIS RLY COOL TOO :D
While WSL2 is certainly a great addition, but working with GPU model training and Docker Desktop on WSL is... well quite a task for me
1:38 I feel attacked, Ken!!! üò°ü§¨We need Power BI on Linux (and Mac)!! 
Moving past this, I will say that I love me some WSL2!!  I think it's great for learning and practicing Linux commands in the terminal, which IMO is a core skill to have for data science.
This was my first time knowing about this but it really sounds interesting and something worth look intoüíØ‚ú®
NEVER liked or could use VM
Hi Ken, was wondering if you can do a video on how you have used Linux for data science and what are the advantages of using it over windows? Thanks and great content as always!
Great explanation! I absolutely hated using a VM (crappy performance) so I went with a dual boot setup. I will definitely have to give this a try, thanks!
Had never heard of this before!!!! But that‚Äôs really useful! Thank you for sharing. I have a Mac laptop, PC with windows and Linux. Lot of working switching back and forth
Give your glowing T-rex a good pat on the head for me. What a lovely companion.
idk for me there aren‚Äôt enough tools that aren‚Äôt on windows
Thanks for the clear explanation! Now I  surely know what it is xD
The story is told by the winners - His Story
I read this in ‚ÄúHow not to Be Wrong, the Power of Mathematical Thinking‚Äù- 
So far it‚Äôs been a good book
Great facts! Keep up the fantastic work Ken!
General Ken Jee for the win!
Sample selection bias
Will really love to see more of this story telling content ...so educative and interesting
I feel like these are military secrets and shouldn't be shared üò¨
Hi, new subscriber here!. Im from latam. And i decided to learn data science through coursera platform. But i have a doubt, do i need a college degree to get a job as a data scientist? or is enough to have this certifications? (ibm, google, stanford, etc)
Loving these knowedge "bombs" of how data science is used in real life scenarios!
Great üíØ
Turn up your MIC!!
The main difference between now and the America back in the 1940s is that  right now Americas leaders are more resistant to receive empiracal data and evidence, especially if it goes against the current political narrative.
This case also put in persceptive what it is called "the survivor bias", in this case taking surviving plane first as the basis for reinforcement. And as said in that video, looking at downed planes was better to look where to make them better. 

The survivor bias is unfortunately a wrong argument used to defend wrong positions all the times, especially by guru wanting to sell "miraculous cure" and taking their only survivor as an example of why their "therapy" "works".

It's the same when using super succesfull billionaires as a path to success ... while ignoring the many upon many who fail while using the exact same techniques. ( People rarely want to recognize external influences as a factor in their success especially chance !)
As expected of the man who came up with the Wald test .. It's so interesting to learn more about him outside my econometrics class Haha .. Survivorship Bias does make a lot of sense, Thanks for the short Ken !!
I didn't receive a notification for it .. maybe that's how shorts work üôÅ
What do you think, will Zillow be able to turn it around? Let me know in the comment section below! Thanks for watching everyone!
We can sue the AI and Zillow for 1 billion dollars!!!!!!!! There Data from Zillow is InAccurate!!!
Absolutely great video and a very clear explanation of what happened.  Reminds me of some of those movies that came out after the 2008 crisis that (admittedly) dramatized the situation, but gave a pretty clear explanation of what happened.  Maybe this video can be optioned for a movie??  I'd love to see you make a cameo in it.  Just tell us when it's gonna hit theaters!!
Simply put, it turns out people only sold to Zillow when they were offered more than what they could get in the open market‚Ä¶
It a starting ground for other organizations adopting ML, there should be a check in reality, inflation and others affecting factors could cause a change in actually results even when the ML says otherwise.
For such complex estimates, with many shifting variables that an automated model can't so reliably account for, there is going to be some error.  That's fine, and Zillow knew this, but I believe the main issue here is that it wasn't a completely closed system.  So, even if on average their estimate was correct, the seller still had to agree to sell the house.  So, on average, when Zillow made a judgment that someone was underestimating the value of their house, I'd say it was more likely that these were the bad houses with unaccounted for problems and the model was overestimating the value.  These people were much more likely to agree for Zillow to buy their house, while in the case where Zillow's model was underestimating a house's value, the seller would almost always turn down the offer.
It seems like this operates on rather poor assumption. However they tuned their model you can guarantee people who sell their houses to Zillow are not going to be representative to the market.

Also what's mind blowing is they bought a bunch of homes in Texas, which is a non disclosure state meaning no one knows what a house actually sold for. The error bars on that model would be huge.
Great case study, would love to hear more of these videos talking about real life scenarios involving models and stuff.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like much of a flop.. they get to write off a 500 million dollar loss and now hold tons of investment properties.
Wow this is so interesting! How crazy the consequences of unsupervised machine learning that went wrong. Great video, Ken! Very well done! I really enjoyed this kind of analysis of real life problems we're facing.
Can we say it as a biggest machine learning model failure ? Idea is definitely good. I also think that whenever a big company buy something people expect good amount which may sometimes overestimated... Also fixing old house is more trouble than building new one...
Lol. Flop hahahaha!
i like your take Ken; you should definitely check out vin vashista's thoughts on this if you havent already. he wrote a really fleshed out piece that i found very insightful from both a machine learning and stakeholder perspective.
By building an instant offer system, they provided a great incentive for people who knew that their properties were not worth the offer to exploit the system. If they didn't give themselves an out via a contingency on appraisal, then they were just plain stupid. An appraisal costs a couple of hundred dollars. If they were losing 80K per flip, then they earned every penny of loss that they took.
More of these kind of contents please!
Just a case of using ML for the wrong reasons to reach the wrong goals. How do you take this big of a risk when the entire country is basically in an economic bubble? smh CEO was over his head.
More of these types of videos por favor
Finally, rich person/company gets screwed by (data) spreadsheet. Couldn't have happen to nicer bunch of idiots.
Scenario 1: Zillow's offer is 10% BELOW true market value.
Scenario 2: Zillow's offer is 10% ABOVE true market value.

90% of people in scenario 1 are going to reject Zillow's offer, while 90% of people in Scenario 2 will accept. The problem doesn't lie in the ML model, the problem lies in the strategy. The further out of Zillows favor the estimate is, the more likely the seller is to accept and vice versa.  I'd wager that if they monitored flips from sellers that rejected their offer,  they would have profited (had their offer been accepted).
There wasn't a real state expert to evaluate the model?

And I do like this type of content, can you make a video about containers prices, and it's reasons?
Carmax transformed car buying and selling with their automated models for evaluation. But houses aren't as homogenous as cars even 2 houses identical on paper and less than 50 feet away from each other can have $100,000 differences in price.
Isn't it also the case that if they get it wrong to the seller's benefit, the transaction will happen, but not the other way around?
This is CRAZY!!! When I sold my house earlier this year, all the home buying estimates (Zillow, Opendoor, ect) were all SOOOO low. But like you said, better to underestimate than overestimate.
My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here.  My 2ct.
Great storytelling and expert analysis.  Would definitely enjoy seeing these data story type videos more
Great analysis, thank you. Do more case studies!
What came to mind was an asymmetric information model from game theory. Perhaps the seller knows more than the buyer about it's flipping potential?
I work in real estate and was wondering why Zillow wasn‚Äôt auditing their deals. Valuing properties that need renovations is tough to automate.
It's like blaming your calculator
Extortion/property taxes and public pensions will be in the toilet and those are excellent things!
This is such an excellent analysis. I checked a few entries in some neighborhoods I know and they were often way above the market value.
Hi Ken - can you clarify why you said that an optimal algorithm should always underestimate the price? Shouldn‚Äôt the residuals of your model be normally distributed - i.e., 50-50 underestimate-overestimate? I‚Äôm struggling to figure out how a model could always underestimate prices, since that would mean always negative residuals.
Great job, Ken. I think mistakes we're made, also one other thing to consider. There was a social media campaign against Zillow's flipping business on Tik Tok and Twitter. Do you think this could have contributed to a change in consumer behavior?
Thanks for teaching us that machine learning is evil and should never be used : )
Never heard of zillow before but this was insightful ‚ù§
Thanks for an explanation from a data science perspective
Ken, hear me out.... instead of going into the Papaya business, let's go into the housing industry ...looks like there is an opening... I think we could build a helluva algorithm üòú
Really interesting video !
Great work. I would to watch more such videos.  Could you talk about Spotify recommendation system and it‚Äôs success?
title should've been "How Zillow Lost $500 ZILLION with Machine Learning Zestimate"
great video though honestly, thanks ken
Hope Richard Barton might be looking at this video during weekend, realising his mistake blaming on ML models
Isn't the biggest issue that the transaction dynamic here is set up in a way to maximize the impact of any mistakes in the buyers favor and minimize the impacts of mistakes in Zillows favor?  In other words, even if the Zestimate was 99% accurate in its offer prices, the incentive for a buyer to accept an "accurate" offer is much less than their incentive to accept an overpriced offer, so the impact of the 1% inaccuracy is destined to be magnified.
Did you know about the Family Guy clip before you put it in or did you find it while making this video? Either way, perfect!
This also shows that something is wrong with this company‚Äôs culture. People directly involved in the housing transactions, if they have some general sense of the local housing market, should know that the price is wrong and be concerned, but there does not seem to be a channel for that concern to be seriously heard by the upper management.
I love this style of video
Thank you for this great video. This should be a case study to understand what machine learning does and what type of risky models need to be run with human intervention.  üëç
Great video, Ken! As someone in the business, how did Zillow's mistake affect companies look to data science?
Very informative Ken,  and a great video. Thank you
That a great case study regarding the concept of Antifragility!
Awesome content Ken! Inspiring for data content creators man, great editing.
Great job, Ken. I would love more of these kinds of videos where you analyze real life applications of Machine learning models and the results from them
Very informative video Ken ! Would definitely watch it again and take notes .. I appreciate the amount of work and research you have put into making it üåªüåª
We sold our house to Zillow right before they stopped purchasing homes a few months ago. When they made their offer I knew something was very wrong, but I wasn't about to tell them that :)
This doesn't surprise me. Real estate investing in my opinion is an art. It takes a vision that can't be broken down into an algorithm.
Thank you for video! It's really useful. Using ML algorithms has a lot of underwater stones.
Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem.

But just to emphasis, flipping a property  to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a "good" choice, as
current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house.

You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE !

but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble.
So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply.

"Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. "

As you said in the section "What is the zestimate really ?"  they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the "negotiation" is downed.

Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight...

How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills.  Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro.

Cheers
Hey Ken, I love this kind of video, very rarely you see ML applications in industry and their results so you can learn from it.
Very interesting video. Lots of takeaways here!
It‚Äôs amazing how you‚Äôve found all relevant B-roll videos and cartoons that matches the content. Flip flop, great joke :)
This is a very interesting subject to cover! Can you make more videos on ML in business and what made the models successful or unsuccessful?
If I have $500M to lose I would be so happy
Would you consider a career in data engineering? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks for watching everyone!

For anyone wondering... Yes, I did make this entire video just so I could use the zoolander clip at the beginning.
1:54-
5:30-
I feel like ordering pizaa, after watching this video but anyway this has a good information why the DE is gaining so much popularity
Is this pizza making tutorial or data engineering video? :D
Thanks for sharing
I wonder what will be the future, will data engineering fade away or boom ?
As a data engineer at the largest shipping company in the world, I can tell you this: a data scientist is nothing without a data engineer and a data engineer is nothing without a software engineer. You need the three of them working together.
I'd stick to Data Scientist role coz I love to analyze better but I work closely with my Data Engineers to get the right data source for me to analyze further.
Thanks Ken.  As a Data Scientist AND Engineer I agree with your video 100%.  Most of my colleagues and myself wear both hats.
Any courses u suggest in data engineering?
Great content, thanks. i just join a company as a data analyst and going through their general data bootcamp. halfway thru, there is a project and i needed to learn cloud and docker etc. i believe ML-Ops and Dev-Ops are also belonging to data engineering. Could you share more on them? Thanks
What programs would you use to be an engineer? I am currently a data analytics grad student using tableau, python, SQL and R.
Now I want a pizza
What college education would you need for these roles? Like maths?
Love your video. Now I'm hungry!
Solid video Ken! 

Should we expect more videos regarding Data Engineering?  üëÄ
Solid job, Ken! As a Data Scientist myself, I definitely agree with all the points you have mentioned in this video!
Don't know too much about the the market for these roles, but a little bit more tomato sauce on that pizza I had my eyes on from the start, would have been great üëç.
Thanks
Thanks for featuring my article Ken Jee!
Expectation : SELECT * FROM perfectly_curated_database

Reality : Nobody knows where the data is, locked access, zero documentation, inconsistent metrics, garbage in-garbage out.
Yes, I would definitely go for a career in Data engineering. You get to see how pipelines are build, you get to understand the flow of data through those pipelines.
Hey! I'm considering data science as a career, and I was curious on your input as to what the best course of action would be, specifically regarding college. Should I consider majoring in a more general field like computer science, or would it be more beneficial to major in data science?
Why do I suddenly have a craving for burnt pizza?
Great! Now I want a pizza ü§ß
Excellent video, cannot agree more. I think experience in a DE role will help you become more effective as a DS later on - you'll gain more knowledge about data infra and tooling that many DS lack.
YES most companies think they need data scientists but what they actually need are data engineers. Awesome video!
I studied data science to become a data scientist and I ended up becoming a data engineer, but I see a great long term future in it üëç
Idk, I'm super optimistic about data science in general. This is one job that has the potential to change the world for the better in ways we've never seen before.
I worked in the oil and gas industry and what you said is very true. It is only realized after big AI/ML teams are built that: we don‚Äôt really have a big data to work with, or our data are not structured/ready, or our problems are not suitable to be solved by ML.
Ken, that's a solid point. I agree that companies are finally realizing that they have to hire data engineer before investing in a data scientist. Also, thanks for the shoutout. That was a nice surprise. I appreciate it!
coming for my interest in data science and curiosity about data engineering and recognising that ooni oven from a joshua weissman video in a tech channel makes me realise i watch too much youtube for which i am really proud of myself
Yes, I am considering data engineering as a carrer as it involves lots of learning about data handling which leads to get into other data science role as well... Chronology
Also Ken, I was wondering your thoughts on algorithm questions for Data Engineers vs. Data Scientists. Maybe a cool idea is to go over different interview questions for the different roles?
I like the analogy that the book Practical MLOps uses. If your home has no access to clean water, then even doing the most basic tasks becomes much more difficult and highly inefficient.
Why there is irrelevant food prep episodes? ü§£ü§£ü§£

Ps: actually, video and its point is to the point
When I look at a lot of analysts jobs, there's a huge skills gap in what companies want now. They're either looking for an old school Excel guy w/ 10 years experience or an entry level Hadoop/Spark genius with some Tableau.
I'd be interested in learning what they do and do some introductory course, but for the most part you've made pursuing Data Science a priority for me.
What's with the pizza?
Data science will always be more popular than data engineering because ‚Äúscience‚Äù is sexy and ‚Äúengineering‚Äù is not.
Moral of the story: you gotta harvest wheat, mill it and turn it into flour and make dough before and so that you can make pizzas. No wheat, no flour, no dough, no pizza.
I dunno if I tried to read too much into it or not but I think each Pizza shot was an analogy lol .. I absolutely love that ! Loved the video and the Pizza making skills üåª My long term dream is to open a restaurant after becoming a very successful professional üçΩüçï
Last year I did a Data Analyst programme and during last winter I started looking for Data Analyst/Data Scientist roles. I ended up getting a Data Engineer role with a local company and for a few months I thought I settled for less. But now, a year into the job, I realise how much better a Data Scientist I can be because of the Data Engineering skills that I have acquired here. 

I was myself blinded by the hype around Data Science, not knowing that without serious Data Engineering skills (to extract, transform/clean, load and most importantly, to understand the journey of data), all the effort of fine tuning ML models could be nullified by the poor quality of data.
so true
Just realized why you chose to include baking pizza to compare how HOT Data Engineering is.
dbt ftw
if i become data scientisit i become hot like you
Hi Ken are you saying you recommend Data engineering than data science ?
I was just enjoying the domain pun and then I heard a shoutout for my channel! Thank you so much for linking me! And great video as always.
2:26 TFW Ken Jee calls out the type of company you work for that has failed to invest in data engineering üòîüò∞üò≠... thanks ken....thanks

Based on the pains I've seen, I'm SUPER optimistic about Data Engineering and think it's going to go "TO THE MOON" these next few years!!
Based on my experience on the job market, Data Engineering is competitive right now, but it's easier to find a place that is willing to train you on it compared to Data Science. I was an analyst for almost 3 years doing a lot of programming and just got a job as a Data Engineer. I was upfront about my relative lack of experience but showed them all the ways I have worked on bridging that gap, and they are willing to train me. I don't think I could find a company willing to do the same for Data Scientist, those usually ask for Masters or PhD at this point.
Nice pizza b-roll, yummy üçï. I also think that existing data scientists will significantly benefit from a little data engineering skills, perhaps the field may eventually move towards becoming a full stack data scientist?
Hi Ken, Thank you for making great content on Data science and engineering in general. Do you have recommendation for Stocks or Options related Data science material?
What is the future of data engineering?
This video is just making hungry üòÖwatching that pizza üçï
If we think of Data Science as a field of study rather than a role, then Data Engineers are technically data scientists.
The pizza b-roll is too funny for no reason
Those pizza making b-roll cracked me tf up xD
Hey Ken Jee, thanks for the great insights! Right now I'm working on a project that involves integrating data from multiple sources for other people to use, which is very similar to data engineering,  but my goal is to be on the data analysis side and I'm hoping that in the future projects around that will arise. With that being said do you thing that doing this kind of work will pay off in the future, or should I be doing data analysis and data science instead? P.S. I have less than 6 months experience in the field so far.
Thanks!
I‚Äôm fairly new to data engineering, but I‚Äôm beginning to notice that there are some segments in Data Engineering approaches to solutions - custom code, implementation of tools, and a hybrid approach each with their own pros and cons.  Custom code can be a good solution when there isn‚Äôt an out-of-the-box solution, the job is small, but this can take time.  Prebuilt tools can get problems solved quickly, but may lack some functionality/features and can be expensive.  The hybrid approach seems to be the most useful, but it takes a lot of knowledge to know how, where, and when to make these decisions for a business solution.
A career as a data engineer likely appeals to people, like myself, who enjoy building stuff that endures over time.
This video definitely triggered my jealousy by looking at your pizza making flex ü§°ü§°

Well as they say, many people just go on for the sophisticated stuff without even clearing the base. I think same is the scenario with data. Many companies joined the data science hype but didn't pay attention to their data or it's architecture. So now as a damage control move, they're back to sorting out their basics and now we need data engineers.

I was waiting for this topic to be touched and finally you did!! ü§†ü§†üê¢üê¢üê¢
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below!
Data science is going to be the most expensive and important job in the future. It's just ahead of its time, companies don't have as much data to work with yet, and don't know what they want to do with it exactly.
It is actually in its infancy and most people including 'experts' dont really know what they are talking about.

The hype is definitely dying down because every monkey that wanted to be data scientist found out that it is not child's play!
what your view on the data janitor youtube channel?
5:38
Thanks for talking about accounting as well
In my job as a statistician in the healthcare field we build counterfactual models.

There's no way this can be completely automated, at least not now. 

Constructing a causal diagram (or DAG) to investigate the relationships between variables requires subject area expertise and intuition of cause & effect. 

This is currently  beyond AI's capabilities. Computers can measure correlation between three variables but don't know which variable is causing the other.
This video gives me motivation on the journey of data science... Thanks a lot
I see where you are coming from. The definition of what a Data Scientist isn't clearly defined. Just the other day I saw a job posting on indeed for a data scientist and the requirements were very similar to a Bi Analyst role. I love learning new things about IT. My focus being a backend developer. I am still trying to understand what role Data Scientist play since it isn't clearly defined. I am assuming Data Scientist key skill is SQL? Data Science technically is a data role?
I think there's at least two possibilities: 
1. The sentiment is coming from the fact that the rigor and knowledge required for data science/analysis is becoming better understood, and thus the lack of real expertise from most applicants is becoming apparent.
2. The real growth in the data science job opportunities requires experience that a lot of applicants don't have, yet. 

How many startups want a Sr. engineer to get things started? How many companies first getting into DS would want senior data scientists/engineers before investing in juniors?
What are your thoughts now with the recent layoffs? LinkedIn has 300+ applicants on every job post I see for data analyst.
It will always rise since the volume of data continues with an upward spiral so data scientists will always be in demand to understand those data and not all tasks can be automatised
thanks for this informative video!
Data science jobs hv already declined
Bro even if you want to become a Baker!!
Is Baking business dying???
Hahahaha lads come on, we got brain. Use it
what about data analytics? is it also gonna die if data science "dies"?
I‚Äôm a Chemical Engineer and I‚Äôm going to do a Masters in Data Science next year and I can tell you thanks so much for this info!! The future is moving towards computers and technology!! All my engineering friends who went and got data science degrees are making more money now than they was as an engineer!
glorified excel , data analyst with PHDs
They said the world end in 30 years too, 30 years ago.
What about the data engineering roles? Will automation take over that?
My concern here is the fact that other countries are offering data scientists for less than half the price... since the job can be done from anywhere, many people could literally die to have a salary of 1k a month and do the same we are doing and still live a comfortable life style.
Data science is a tool not a field
Data Science is oversaturated and it will be harder and harder to get a job.  
Because many more poeple come into the field.. 
On top of that there is outsourcing.. 
And the field itself is changing which means you run agains time, and if you don't learn the new trendy technology you will be absolite.  
It is a forever climb without a break, probably you will burn out in a couple of years.. 
And be replaced by a hungry young fool who wants to be a Data Scientist.. 
And the cirlce repeats.
Computer Science never dies. Computer engineering neither.
What's up with the fruit cuts?  Good informative video. Thank you.
Thank you for putting up all the analysis together to conclude straightforward why Data science isn't going to fade away for sometime in the industry. Being into the Banking operations where I specifically work for the Fund accounting dept, I can easily vouch that Data science is completely taking control in so many parts of day-to-day activities. Eventually in a few years, it will get boom more than how it is now and it's a fact.
I just got a new job as a data scientist, so I don't know if there is no future.
Great thanks
Data science is ever evolving and like he said, data driven decision making is here to stay. It's not a new concept to begin with. Some of the big changes that will happen in the field are ethics. The ethics of data collection, storage and analysis is under intense scrutiny. The laws will change and the tools we use will do too. Our tools will evolve and become more efficient. Even if there is automation,there will be need for people to manage automation. Like any another tech field, we will have to keep updating our skillset to stay relevant.
Yes, I totally agree.. for me it comes from the lack of understanding of what the roles are and the importance we as "data people" play. There is a broad overview, but not in-depth know how.

 Automation is the dream people are buying into but like you showed earlier 57% of companies use data. Alot of companies who claim to be AI or data science driven dont even have a data governance or strategy in place. 

Data Jobs are here to stay; they are the backbone of the digital world.
Cool video. Just looking to switch my profession from accountancy to data science. I hope it will work for me in the future.
Mathematics, Mathematics and Mathematics. If you are good at it. It's not going anywhere. Learn Python along the way and 5 important data structure  - Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Linked List and Hash Tables. You will be happy for next 50 years and oh...learn to communicate...written and verbal irrespective of who you want to become. :)
Is Data Science Dying?

No only we are while tryna learn it.
Is Data Science still not dying as of today? (7 months after this video was posted) ;)
Hi Ken jee .Currently i am working as a software tester .and i want to know that wil software testing has future ? which one is better data science or software testing ? .if data science has more future  and package then i will shift my career into Data science .need suggestion form U
In my country, every time there is an entry level data science role, there is a crazy amount of applicants. It feels like it's too much competition for this position. is it the same in your country?
I don't care if the field dies or not.  I enjoy the process.
It‚Äôs just gonna be rebranded as a new name. It used to be called Decision Support Systems then Business Intelligence and now Data Science‚Ä¶ eventually a new name will come to the same set of work.
It will not only exist, it will be more advanced than ever.
Hello Ken Jee. How can I do contact with you??
The future is about data.
Haven‚Äôt seen the clip, still can say 10000% data science will be one of the most important jobs for companies. Like, everything is data right now. It‚Äôs only getting bigger ‚Ä¶
Your click, likes, purchase, trends in every sing thing 
And the one who can analyze those stuff,  they will be gods
Boy, no way this field is dying, the reason it might seem like this is because Data Science/Business IT degrees are being introduced at what feels like every University right now. There's the sentiment that IT degrees, especially in Business IT, are sort of the new MBA programmes, in that people who want to "get rich quickly" do them and flood the job market with what are considered short term CS skills that could end up being automated in the next 10-15 years.
Now, I don't believe this to be true. I estimate Data Science is about to establish itself as its own proper (academic) field right now, which is why, suddenly, there's specific degress for it. Most people who work in DS jobs now did their degrees in math or CS, whereas the new generation will have proper DS degrees to go off. Kind of like how early programmers had math degrees, simply because Computer Science hadn't established itself as its own field yet.
Once data science is automated, the next big thing will be to automate automation.
Hi Ken, I'm 37 years old and from Banking industry. Studied accountancy and economics. I have been contemplating about doing data science for past a couple of years as i have never felt too confident about it.

Data is definitely important but people doing masters/major in statistics will have upper hand to people who are doing data science course with no prior engineering background.
Also, people who know various coding languages might again have upper hand.
Rest you have in the job training.

Please share your response. I want to learn data science but I'm not feeling too confident about it's future for someone with my background.
Another great example outside of data science is medical laboratory science. Over the years it has become more and more automated with more machines doing lab tests.. but all that has created is the ability to do more volume. We need people to interpret the results and make sure they are okay. Machines break down all the time and the job is VERY much in demand.
People need it.  If they say they don't they are hiring the skills under multiple / different job titles.
As an accountant I can tell you the reason why you are not seeing any data scientists in small to midsize companies is because they cannot justify the head count.  Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company.  The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function.  But that will probably change as time goes on.

Also, as companies grow then the need for data scientists will grow as well.
In my surroundings I can tell that the reason why students aren't taking data science is because they find statistics too hard and also consider web development and devops as a likeable and easy field.
This seems to be a silly thing that I see all the time with anything connected to coding. I've been learning to code (and now getting into data science) for about a year and a half. I have seen so many comments like is JavaScript dying? Is web development dying? Is Deno dead already? Even when people ask "Is JQuery dead?'" then you realise how many sites still use JQuery. The answer to the "Is it dead/dying?" question is usually "no"
I feel it‚Äôs cuz YouTube data community is growing and every other day, it seem as thou there‚Äôs more new people then not. Feels like by the time I grad in 5years, not much of the pie would be left for newbies?
No-code really is just a new buzzword that means what "democratization" used to mean.

It lets unskilled people do what we do so we can learn the new hotness in our field. I used to be a web analyst. When Google Analytics started interpreting itself, I moved on to software skills and ML skills.

No-code is good. As soon as we get comfortable with techniques, they are no longer cutting edge. So they're boring. No-code offloads that shit to our stakeholders so we can move on to the new cool stuff.
AutoML pretty scary...
Today I just got into college for artificial intelligence and data science  BTEC and Google recommend your article
Hi Ken, thanks for your good sharing of data science! I've been working for a BI company for 5 months as a project manager. We set up data warehouses and develop Power BI dashboards for many customers in a big variety of industries (cosmetic, food, electronic, medicine, clinic, hotel, aquaculture., etc.) The business is pretty good. Some of them have started using machine learning for prediction. So I think that data science is trending upward.
Hello sir i really benefit from ur great videos and briefs ,, i just want to ask can i start my journey as a data scientist or i have to start as a data analytic ,, thanks alot for reply üòä
What technology/skill should I acquire which is at boom??
Is it Salesforce?
I guess this video is a good example on how to present your results for the end user xD
Hi there Thank you for your video first of all.I have Statistics bachelor degree I've never work as a statistician.Im really into jumping  UX/UI design career, but since my bachelor so relevant with data scientist I'm having a little bit hard time to decide. I'm thinking to have bootcamp and have zero coding experience. I like math but also I love searching, psychology and being creative . what your suggestion would be for me ? Ux designer or data scientist ? Ux designer excites me more, but I'm having fear how hard finding a job will be.Data scientist scares me to learn and personally have low interest but I wanna find job easily and kinda don't wanna feel my bachelor degree was a waste.
Good vid
Really enjoyed this video! I really don't understand why people would ask if data science is a dying trend/industry/discipline etc. With more data becoming available and languages/tools like Python and R getting regular updates, there will always be a need for those skills and I personally don't see any of this becoming obsolete. I can see why data science as a title might render it declining trend but I wouldn't focus so much on what constitutes data science. Also you need to keep making content so this discipline cannot die!!!
I am just starting to learn Data Science With python & Machine learning with python.
This type of articles just demotivated me Dear. I want to do Job in USA as a Data Scientist.
I am from India
Maths & Stats will live FOREVER. Data Science is a supportive tool to MATHS & STATS.
What everyone including companies themselves fail to understand is that when they are asking for data scientists, and ML engineers, they are really wanting to be disrupting their own business before someone else does it for them. AI and data science are just strongly associated with digital disruption. When viewed through this lens, data professionals will be needed but the work they do and technologies they use will evolve. The role of digital disruption by making use of data through whatever technology is available is what people should focus on to remain relevant.
Down
Is it true in India...... Vacancy very less for data science
Data science is statistics.... 
Its not a fashion trend.. 
Its like saying the laws of motion are out of fashion.... üòëüôÑ
that shirt is üî•üî•üî•
There will never be any decline in any of the IT field and its Skills ,be it Data Science or Development or Testing...!
What will decline is people's mindset to learn new things at any point and adapt through it.

Same is the scenario in any other field.... Demands increase doesn't mean it's value will decrease later !!!

People should stick to their individual Skill rather than hype of new trend !!!!
BS
I'm glad to have stumbled upon your account! I'm interested in learning more about the field and business world and am looking forward to listening to your insights across videos.
Peoples fear of A.I period.
Data analysis is a time consuming process and no miracle can take place if you create a data model and take a call based on the outcome. Data science mostly help companies in making marketing and sales decision - these final decision will always stay with the people who are marketing and sales veterans. In essence, companies will always look for data scientists but not to depend on them solely but rather to use them as a helping tool for core veterans of companies. Nobody in right mind will change a product price solely based on a data model. So yes, the demand for data scientists will eventually slow down.
Thank you for clarifying and busting the myths. You rock!! :)
üëçüèæ
One thing I can attest to is that it's getting far more stressful as the purview grows.
Omg you scared me with the title.
.l..I'm learning DS and wish to continue with this career path
What about machine learning ?
I use data science  for gambling
Non relevant comment: As the like #1234 i feel accomplished i life.
Respected Ken Sir,

Greetings, I hope you will be fine.

Ken this is Awais Ahmad, I just need your 5 min's.

Want to ask, I'm desperately looking for the Internship/Job to support my family related to Data Science, Data Analyst/Database developer/ETL,BI develoepr/ role. I hope you can help me.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Awais Ahmad
I am just about to graduate from my Data Science Masters.
Mathematics never dies. Programming Languages are rising and decline,  but calculus,  matrices and numerics will exists until the known universe ends
In Strategic Management of Technology, Data Science would be still in the early stage of the S-curve. We are far from maturity what else a decline.
As for AutoAI/AI GUI I been using one given by my company but the performance has only been surpar. I am using it more as a pipeline designer so less technical coworkers who are not comfortable with code can use it. On the other hand, fine tuning pretrained model has much better results and I think models trained by big tech companies will dominant in the next 5 years. 
I also agree with your point with data engineering as I have spent a lot of time in this area. 
So my 2 cents is Transfer learning tuning w/ preprocessing > AutoAI.

My data will eventually output to some low code/no code applications, but I don't see how those application will replace software engineers/developers. I hope this is the same situation for us data scientist.
I think part of it is the pressure for the next content piece. There are only so many ‚Äòdo data science‚Äô posts/videos you can do before saturation. Also, you‚Äôre right about the absorption of these roles by different businesses and sectors over time, each part has lead firms then a long tail who take time to adapt to these trends.
Data science is big but being able to interpret and provide insights from the data is where the money is. Lots of people can pull data and code using R, python etc..but if you can't explain how to use that results for predictive forecast or explaining how it either proves or disapproves your initial hypothesis then data analytics does not add any value.
a clickbait(maybe not) is worth watching. Thank you Ken
Hello Ken have to agree with you, and as trends or tools change, your already one step ahead in learning whatever comes along. Data Analyst is a good starting point but not end all. The more tools you have the better your chances of advancing. That is my two bits. Have a wonderful holiday
Hey Ken, your video is such a bliss as always. I am working as System Analyst aged 41 years. Can I learn Data Science at this age and start my career in it? 
What advice you have for me?
True data scientist would go and check statistics :d
i literally just got some clarity in this subject and people are saying its dying come on!!!
So becoming a data analyst or business analyst is definitely worth it. As well as learning python for various reasons
FYI in Israel there's a very very big demand for data scientists and a very short supply
Data science jobs are reaching the SWE jobs number. So I guess its nt going to die anytime soon
I see not much confidence on Ken's face though!
Whether  block chain technology kills data scientist role ?
It will merge with Data Engineer. ^Did not watched
I think entry level roles for data science are getting pretty saturated and competitive. This might create the impression of less demand for some people. However the value of a veteran data scientist is hard to overstate.
But is it too late to become a data science YouTube influencer???
I hope not, I just enrolled in a Masters in DS ha
Excellent analysis Ken. I admire your effort to reduce bias (and maybe increase variance).
Just recently started my first role as a data analyst/consultant for a property consultancy, people in other teams and companies have told me about the struggle they are having finding data analysts.  I'm from the UK so this may of course differ where you are living but its clear new companies are realising how imporant data is.
I always think that data science and analyst job will be replaced by AI. It is not that hard. The future is about human interactions. All human capabilities can be performed (even better) by computers. I also read many articles about this and, the truth is yes, the future jobs will be the ones which requires cognitive, psycology and sense of human beings.
Why the hell would it die
Do you think someone going through college whose interested in data science be better off majoring in computer science or data science?
No Data science is a teeneager... It will not die as early as some ppl are thinking... Live long data science...
As a student in Data Science, in order to automate those tasks, AI needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off.
Thanks, Ken, for the great insights. I don't see data science dying but just continuously evolving. It better not be too late to start your data science career because I'm probably going to set the age record for getting started! Thank you so much for the way you keep me challenged to continue growing. 

BTW, I took your recommendation to get Aurelien Geron's ML book because I needed another resource to bolster my green ML skills. Great find!
The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party.
Ken Jee hit the nail on the head perfectly. The general public, major business and especially the media have little to no understanding what data science and diversity of roles in this field. 

Since the field is much newer than others, how would anyone who communicates about value it or hold it in regard to any other white collar job? So when people want to move on to write about the next hot topic trend, or lack understanding of the subjects projected growth, its just easier to say it is dying.
Is death dying ?
I couldn't help but notice the b-roll of fruit, coconuts, woodroses, and banana trees, are you in Hawai'i?
I saw GPT3 and thought, welp, most software engineering jobs are going to get booted. 
Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong. And also if this could spillover to data science.
There is a problem with those statistics.
If data scientist jobs grow from 1000 to 10000 that's nothing really even if it has a huuuuuge percentage in increase.
Plus, you are almost DEAD if you look for an entry level position.
Very solid arguments. Even though the title might change, the skill sets will definitely always be in demand.
I also think causal inference will be more popular in the future of data science which is more difficult to automate than prediction as it requires more interpretability
Greetings Ken Jee!
What should we do when finding conflicts between packages version in anaconda-venv?

Thnx ..
I think companies are realizing they need data engineers more than data scientists. I see 4 data engineers for every 1 data scientists. I also see a lot of overlap between data scientists and analysts, yet one gets paid significantly more for having a fancy title, but can‚Äôt write basic sql lol. Why not just have ML Engineer, Software Engineer, and Analyst all under Data Operations or Data Analytics and Engineering? The need for all these titles are annoying and unnecessary.
Always a great video master master Ken! I think with Alteryx a lot of people feel a lot of these jobs are being automated and everyone can run a model.  But I found many of people who just run these workflows can't really explain the results when you ask detailed questions.  There's always going be work for some cookie cutter projects but there will always be room for when you need to innovate and a cookie cutter approach won't be the best solution.  Totally agree with your analysis! Keep up the great work! Happy early ThanksGiving!
The field will continue to rise but slow down! AND will morph!
1:05
To prove if DATA science is going up or down we see the DATA.....

Hence, proved that it isn't going down üòèüòè
Hello!

I have a question and it is In case we are new in data science and do not have work experience in data science, what is your recommendation to get into a data science job?
And I have another question and that is, what projects would you recommend us to do in order to we can know if we are prepared for a data science job or not. Thank you so much!
To me the new Google phone is proof that data science and ML are literally just getting started, I mean the phone has a "Tensor" processing unit, and it's most advertised features are Deep Learning enabled.
Agree, data science in not dying. It's for many reasons still in infancy stage, so a lot more to come.
I really like you Ken, but educational content that's I want... Instead of getting uncertain topics like thisss
I‚Äôm starting to learn data science with a mind towards still being employable in 2050. No matter whether the job of ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù is around then, the skills learned in the job will be invaluable. Analysis, data architecture, machine learning, data visualization, Python and R, all of these skills will allow data scientists to be on the cutting edge of any new tools developed between then and now. And big data is getting bigger by the second. Barring some kind of AGI singularity, data science should continue on an upward trend.

Thanks Ken for all the help in your videos so far, and for confirming my hunch that the field is going strong.
The Data Wiz has spoken ..Now that's clear " Data Science isn't Dying"  

Totally agree with your point ken where you mentioned that when companies and people would be able to understand the difference between different data roles , these questions wouldn't be coming again n again  ...

Also i feel you should title your videos as Data  Myth Buster by ken :)
to the moon, diamond hands
Great insights as always Ken! The data science umbrella is so large, that several "titles" will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems.
But in these days we have less job opportunities in this field donno about future
When I was 12 years old, I wanted to learn HTML and JavaScript to build my own website that had guitars and penguins on it.

All the so-called "smart" "adults" around me said that programming was a waste of time because all the programming jobs would get outsourced to other countries anyways and that programming was too hard for people who weren't good at math (like me). Not knowing anything, I decided to listen to them.

Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12. 

Don't listen to people who aren't experts in the field you are exploring.

Data science today is what HTML and web development was in 1997. It's not that new but it is still growing fast enough and there's plenty of room for more data scientists and computer programmers.
I think easy entry to data science is dying however skilled data science entry is increasing in demand.

The main barrier is how many are going to squeeze every neuron in their brain to truly work to their potential and capacity to be skilled and make value in this field.
@3:50, yes, Web Developers are still in high demand, but today their pay rate and demand isn't the same as it was back in the 90's and 00's

Wouldn't be surprised if the same happens with Data Analysts / Scientists
My assumption - no analysis - was that there is a glut of data science boot camp graduates - plus the disconnect I've seen mentioned between people who study things like NLP and image recognition, which are not in demand in the workforce.  Probably part of it for me is just that - i dont want to be a data scientist.  I'm more interested in data profiling and analysis and modeling.  I actually was turned down for a role I didnt realy want - because while the role said 'data analyst' they really wanted a junior data scientist - someone who WANTED to be a data scientist.  
I stumbled in to a great role, though, I think!
Great video Ken! Completely agree that data science is on the rise as companies are just realising the full potential üöÄ
On the rise. Data never dies. It will grow. How good ai is doing is also a data.
Hi ken ! I wanted to ask u this question last time when we discussed the video but I thought Youtube would be better. I am applying for a PhD in the states and considering specializing in NLP. I am also considering working on applied fields like climatology or environmental economics since I come from an econ background, but ofc the algorithms are the same ( no DL there ofc ) .. I just want to get your opinion on that if possible, but ofc don't worry I won't take it as Quran in my case lol ( It means a lot to me tho üåª )
Great insights. Thank you. 
I‚Äôm just a beginner in Data Science and headlines like this pop up every once in a while. üòÇ
The lack of focus on data leadership and waste from hype, we're just not seeing a lot of feasible products and services that companies know what to do with or want to pay for.

There's significant abrasion between the skills that are professed via Google and what companies actually need done.  With that being said, there are a lot of newbies unwilling to make a commitment to the career.  When they find out it's not just pushing buttons in Anaconda, they bail.

Will data science grow or will companies adapt to what's available in the software and labor market when the hype dies?  Or will they just keep throwing money into the unknown?
I agree!!
Thanks Ken ! I am finishing my last year in Industrial Engineering and your videos motivated me to try learning DS as a side hustle. To be honest with you, it seems really overwhelming at first because the field is gigantic and i am trying to keep the pace with my Uni studies and my part time job... all of this at the same time... Currently i am using Dataquest to learn the basics (Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, SQL, etc.). but sometimes the motivation hits all time low even though i am in love with this new domain. Do you have some quick and effectif tips with this issue ? Thanks Again.
Great video Mr.Jee thanks for your sharing your knowledge
Great video Ken! I definitely see the field trending up from an employer's perspective. Like you said, so many companies that aren't the FAANG companies are just starting to get to grips with the amount of data that they have available to them and will need to hire more and more data scientists as they seek to extract insights from their data.
As someone who's a relatively new data scientist, thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that I needed Ken üòâ
Top video, thanks for the quality insight
Data science is definitely not dying and for the fact it's only scaling much bigger. Companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts üíØ.
Definitely think it on the upwards trend
The Data Science King ü§¥ has spoken; Data Science is NOT DYING!!

Very much agree with this, Ken!  I also will add that I feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future.
Long live data scinceüòÇ
Yea I agree with you totally
Thanks for the awesome analysis. I think data science is still on the rise. I think because it's a bit hard to get into the industry especially for beginners makes it seem like it's on the decline.
That's really on point. People see advancements in tech and join the bandwagon of making predictions about the decline of human jobs. I think we have not yet realised that automated solutions would most probably be generic and not user specific. In this field of ever growing competition, users would be looking for more personalized solutions and for that, we would require people.
This video hit the net at a perfect time for me. Applying now and this gives me the confidence that there are junior DS roles to be filled and not the plethora of senior data science listings I've come across. Thanks Ken üôè
Hey Ken, love your stuff, what advice would you have for someone who‚Äôs soon to be graduated with a masters in data science who now only sees anxiety inducing videos like this? üò¨ what skills could someone like me look to add that are less likely to become automated or phased out?
Data scientists who have some knowledge of a non-tech domain will be in great demand too. In sports, its advantages are manifold and its usage is on a rise.
Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities.
I don't think it's gonna die anytime soon. Companies which uses data to grow their business have a significant upper hand on businesses who don't. So, even if the new entrepreneurs don't want to use data, they still will have to use it otherwise they are gonna get beaten easily by their competitor's who are using it. And the fact that people give away their data 24/7 , you need someone to analyse that, so data science is probably on the rise in my opinion, no doubt at all
Okay, BUT HOW DO YOU FIND PERFECT CLIPS FOR EVERYTHING!
Good to hear that :)
Hey Ken, thank you for your insights! Btw, I'm seeing Blockchain developer jobs are on the rise and Blockchain maybe the next big thing. Do you agree? Is there an intersection between the two kinds of jobs (BC and DS) or are they mutually exclusive?
Data Science is growing
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below!
borlest - secret strategy to get taller (thank me later)
Speaking of books that improve your health.......we want to live by aajonus vonderplanitz.
I have been reading a lot about investments and budgeting for the past couple years. A book that really made an impact on me is "The Millionaire Next Door" by Thomas Stanley. One of the most important concepts that stuck with me is understanding and balancing your offense and defense with money. "Offense" means controlling how much money you make - which you often have less control over. And "defense", which is how you spend money which is more controllable. It is pretty data heavy...which you might like as a data scientist.
Watching this in preparation for actually reading a book next year. Great video Ken!
Bro I can definitely recommend Leo and Longevity to you, he has a lot of videos about topics that surround health such as genetics, sleep, food, and especially longevity. Could be extra interesting to you as he studied statistics at the LSE
Hey Ken, thanks for the video!

One of the nonfiction books that has impacted me the most is "Factfulness" by Hans Rosling. It shows inherent biases in how we perceive that data is generated and get a misrepresentation of the world. Really worth it!
Atomic Habits: Just start with one push up a day...

David Goggins: Excuse me???
Hi Ken. Read "How not to die". That will really make an impact.
7. The personalised diet
6. Digital minimalism, Deep work
5. Can‚Äôt hurt me
4. Breath
3. Why we sleep
2. Lifespan
1. Atomic Habits
0. Huberman podcast
Thanks bro
Loved this video. Atomic Habits is my all time fav.Waiting for more book recomendations.
Hey Ken,
read "Thinking, Fast and Slow" if you haven't yet. It's about how we constantly make bad/wrong decisions without noticing it, and what psychological mechanisms are behind it. These mechanisms are so fundamental to our thinking that even if you are aware of them, you still are prone to making those thinking errors. It's basically more than half a century of Kahnemann's own research distilled into one concise and very densely written book and probably the best book of the 21st century to date.
Hey Ken... Great recommendations... These are covering almost every part of our life... I would like to recommend Rich dad Poor dad, I'm currently reading it now... It will help us to understand importance of financial literacy...
thanks for the recommendations... one thing i need to implement among the many  is cutting out social media time
7:35 to 8:09 this is such a good point everyone ignores the sleep like no 6 hours of sleep is enough for me no it's not same for everyone you don't need pills to be healthy you just need good and long sleep.
Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life.

You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone.

I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone.
I SAW GOGGINS WOOOAH.
Was just looking for new books to read. This perfect.
Atomic Habits has been wonderful read for me.
i improved my habits and also started making new habits and track there progress and who doesnt like the Reward part of it haha.
I have been more into data books now a days and trying to understand how data affects business.
Currectly reading "Data Means Business" and  "Stock market".
What all books are you guys reading currently?
Yoooo!! I have the same shirt! It's super comfy.  Always great stuff master master ken!
THE ICE BATHS RIGHT
I REALLY WANTED THIS VIDEO ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
interesting, you just spoilered book about food and atomic habits. I do not need to read them anymore ü§£
Thanks for the amazing book recommendations...I'm sure to read Why We Sleep after this...the way you described it will ensure that! Also would like to remain the same age watching your videos for 100 years more...the one on aging too...

I am not a fan of reading too...but I do prefer these type of books over any novels. Thanks for these suggestions! üòä
Hi Ken, are there any books on the topic that you found useless despite being often recommended?

Here's my small list:

1. How will you measure your life? By Clayton Christiansen

2. Never split the difference by Chris Voss who is the former FBI negotiator

3. You are a badass by Jen Sincero - a very powerful self-help book

4. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel - so far my favourite book about financial literacy
While in general on par with most, I always wonder why people are so sure about what a "good" habit is. So in general I think everyone should be make sure about that before jumping to conclusion on how to achieve these "good" habits as efficient and fast as possible. Just an example: is efficiency something that is always better than inefficiency.
That's why I highly recommend something like:
Henry Miller - Colossus of Maroussi
Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morality
Beauvoir - The Mandarins 
etc.
Made me wonder whether optimization is the holy grail :)
It's good to see you uploaded this video! I'm always looking for great book recommendations on the topic. I'm going to add Digital Minimalism, Breathing, and Why We Sleep to my next reads list! I've read Atomic habits and it's indeed a great book.

I've read a few personal development books, as I'm fascinated with the topic and always looking to increase my productivity and personal character. The first book I've read on the topic that got me started with everything else is "7 habits of highly effective people." That book did the same for me as Atomic habits did for you. I recommend it, it's a very interesting read.

Btw, I'm halfway of reading Getting Things Done. It's a great book, and it has added immediate value to my life already. I recommend it, too.
I am ashamed of not being able to recommend any book in this regard :3 I will definitely be reading more starting with this list ! ( I share Ecstacy's disappointment btw Haha ) 
I think I'll start with Atomic Habits ! Thank you Ken :)
üòÇ Move over firefighters!!! Here's comes the Data Scientists calendar!! ü§£
BAM! Love the shirt!! :)
Hey love book 3! I told my boss to talk about the importance of sleep because of this book
Great recommendations ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Love me some "Atomic Habits", I think it looks like a favorite here in the comment section as well!

Also was looking at your books on your bookshelf (#creeping) and saw you had "Storyworthy".  I just started this book!
I have also read the combo Cal Newport + James Clear + Matt Walker. The have radically reahaped me, and following their advices during the past year has generated some serious improvements in my life
Thank you for sharing! Dope list!!
Appreciate you coming out as Pro-Book in the last podcast. We should all protest now.
Hello sir, thank you for your recommendation. I just bought a book named Getting Things Done -- The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen, hopefully it is good. It was recommended by someone else. Also, recently read The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, it really helps to establish a healthy idea on wealth and wealth management. Best Regards.
Great list! Thanks for sharing :) I am afraid to read the one about sleep though.... üòÖ
Love the thumbnail... will take people's breathe away.
Atomic habits is my favorite definitely. I am currently reading " Crushing it" By Gary vee
I recommend "How Not to Die" by Michael Greger
I was expecting some thirsty people in the comment section but it's a little too clean kek
Great video Ken, Atomic Habits and Why We Sleep are definitely some of my favourites. 
I also particularly enjoyed The Courage to be Disliked / Happy üòä
Just Osho will change your life. No other book needed.
Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's "the bullet journal method"  by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter. 

Not having something beautiful or gating people out because "your stuff is no bullet journal".
Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me "this is not a bullet journal" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal.

Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit. And this book is about having habits that adapt to the circumstances of your life. How to maintain one when things are very hard and how to maximize the benefits of a good day.
Yoo Ken what a flex in the thumbnail!! ü§†ü§†üê¢üê¢

Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology: 

1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely
2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language
3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read)
4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics üê¢
5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world.
6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion*
7:  *As a man thinketh*  

Well the list does go on but I hope this will be of some value to you üê¢üê¢üê¢
You might also be interested in the practice of self hypnosis. It helps clear the mind, relax the body and increase mental focus for, say, doing machine learning ;)

The problem is my main source of information on the subject is from a french guy named Benjamin Lubszynski. He has a youtube channel unfortunately in french and two books, also in french.

That being said I'll look for english sources for this as I believe it is a lovely habit from which everyone can benefit and its benefits are many :) (greater than meditation as it takes its source from the subconscious which makes it both more accessible than meditation but also much more effective).
Wow was thinking to ask you about your book collection after seeing that data science course video.. and here we go..
Man's search for meaning and a monk who sold his Ferrari
Two of my favourite books that talk about life
Please leave some book recommendations below! Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope this video gets you as excited about podcasting as I am! 

If you are interested in my podcast (related to data science) you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast
üíØ... Podcasting can help us to improve communication.
You‚Äôre motivating me. Thanks Ken
how to start? where to start a podcast?
It's amazing to hear you say that you also struggled and stumbled over your words early on. I've wanted to start a podcast for months now but I'm fairly introverted so I've been putting it off. Your comment about controlling the environment instead of being controlled by it hit the nail on the head and I've never thought about it that way.

Thanks for sharing that Ken! That's something that I'll remember for a long time.
Hey I stumbled across your channel and been enjoying the content. I really want to do a intermediate data analytics project (ideally with SQL, Python tableau etc) but struggle for good ideas, I don‚Äôt want to just do a basic get csv data set and analysis but want to do bit more in depth and challenging, do you have any ideas? Thank you
Agreed 100%, I also feel that it helps me to understand myself better as well. Do you think it‚Äôs possible for the next guest on Ken‚Äôs Nearest Neighbors to be Ken Jee? Ken interviews Ken, would be an awesome episode :)
You know.... Thank you for this. I'll give it a shot.
Started a small YouTube channel and it helped me practice communication and storytelling skills to recently land a Data Engineer Consultant role. Definitely agree haha
What are your thoughts on live podcasting? I'm curious how much editing you're currently doing...
I really like your podcast ! I was wondering how much time does it take doing research on the guest ? Or maybe as time goes by you don't need to prepare as much as before ?
6:26 I made the cut!! I‚Äôm also a very animated talker‚Ä¶ my hands help tell the story üòÇ
KNN is really a great channel with great content, I love the style of "insert situation/problem" as the video/podcast topic, this makes it a lot better for someone to relate to.
üå∏üôèüèΩüåû
I'm thinking of starting sort of an anti-podcast and titling it something super awkward like, "Nobody Should Listen to This Podcast." I'd describe it as an arrogant jerk and his (formerly) inner monologue. 

That way, it's half satirical reverse psychology, half self-sabotage. Which is sort of my thing, really. üòÅ
I started a podcast mainly coz I just wanted to learn how to talk to people. To get out of my social awkwardness. And it worked!! Absolutely agree with all the points you have made and even though I have only done 2-3 episodes I can relate very much!! Am very much looking forward to resume my podcast work after my college applications and all thanks to you Ken!! üê¢üê¢üê¢

My podcast isn't that interesting, it's completely random hahaha(It did make Tina laugh tho ü§°). Let's see if my brain helps me to make interesting content ü§†ü§†üê¢üê¢

The most important part of this video is the explanation of how you figure out to replace the ().  I am going on 9 years as an analyst and still more days then not I am googling something I don't know how to do yet.  Keep up the good work Ken!
Hi

how can we deploy this as a webapp on heroku?
waiting for your reply please :(
imho nothing looks better than dash plotly
18:25 "I also want to do just a little bit more data manipulation" .... said no one ever üò≥jk
awesome tutorial!! Really craving a burrito now üåØ
Hey, Thank you Ken.  I liked the approch via atoti
Would be cool to do a comparison of this package, Streamlit, and Dash!
I love burritos and the fact you made a dashboard made me take interest in dashboards & incorporating some dashboard into my portfolio. Productive Saturday so far thanka to you! üôè
You finally created another project video!!!  Thank you Ken!!

Your last data science project series was the #1 reason I have my current data science role! 

Thank you for providing quality data science content and never stop. Can't thank you enough.
Dashboards are always beautiful... Great and helpful video... üôå
Ken do be looking buff in this t-shirt
It's always fun and informative to learn the thought process behind the analysis. Great video Ken! Burritos, yummy üåØ

Thanks for watching everyone! Be sure to follow along with the code here: https://github.com/atoti/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks/burritos
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope you found the video informative! If you're looking for more places to learn about data science, definitely give my podcast a look!

Of course it is.
I didn't get the papaya's stuff
I selfishly love only seeing 6k views on these videos because they are absolutely chock full of incredible info but it's clear that I'm still pretty early! Thanks Ken Jee
Bayesian Learning will be very important. The BBN ability to operate probabilistically and work with incomplete evidence is quite powerful. It can also allow for interesting dataset quality/Imputation checks. I don't know why more people don't talk about this
Found it. your great content on ML-Ops. Thanks
Hii Ken,

I am also trying to switch career to data science field. Just had one question. How much programming is required?? Are data structures like trees and their algorithms also important?
Thanks for sharing. It seems like one of those areas which you don't really get the hang of unless you're in the industry, simply because companies have that infrastructure built.
Great breakdown‚Ä¶ now I understand it better üë©‚Äçüéì
i hope i make it in life, thank you
Thank you for clarifying on ML Ops Ken!

Was fairly confused on it at first but this video definitely helped!
Hi Ken,
I am planning to change Career to be a Data Scientist 
Although I started the Google Analytics professional certification and I plan to then do a course in Python for Data science after. I am realising it may not be the right step to take and maybe a water of time 
Do you think it may be useful and I should complete the course or do I just dive into a Data science course instead.
Great and concise video Ken on MLop! Is that a Papaya T-shirt? At first thought the black circles were scattered data points but the hint at 5:36 suggested they‚Äôre black seeds of the Papaya?
That shirt though
Great video, Ken! Does only big companies have ML Ops department/team?
Loving the increased production quality in your videos lately! I've always been a bit unsure what ML Ops means but your explanation makes sense. Curious to know if you're trying to implement it yourself?
Hi uncle Ken, Great video, thanks for sharing this.... Can you do a video of you doing a full kaggle project ( if you want to XD ) it will be really cool 

Stay Hard
Papaya?
Go to Brazil for Papayas @Ken Jee üòäüòé
Thanks for the video ! 
I understand the importance of MLOps as a concept, but I don't understand why it has become a job.

I feel like MLOps principles should be carried out by data scientists that understand business and project managers that understand data science ; there is no need for a separate position.
Ml ops was something that I didn't  understand but now I do üíØ. I know what video to send someone if you want to know meaning of Mlops or devops.
Thank you Ken!!!!
Commenting for the algorithm. Keep it up!
I am scared of Docker :3 Should probably work more on it starting in this area. Also does this mean that pineapple is your second favourite fruit haha ? 
Oh and btw I graduated from my Master's today üòÅüòÄ
Thanks for a great video with a clear explanation :) 
btw nice dinosaur lamp :D
Thanks for the clear explanation, now I know what it isüòÄ
LETS GO!! PAPAYA TEAM :)
Absolutely, thank you so much for sharing with us. I have recently started the ML Engineering for Production in Coursera. I will love to see more videos on this topic, Ken.
Great video coving this. I would like to mention the book "Practical MLOps" has just released and it has been such a great read with wonderful exercises.
The game keeps changing
EARLY!
Thanks for watching everyone! Check out your free month at 365 Data Science Here! https://bit.ly/2YUxsAx
The ultimate Data Science goal is to solve business problems. So it goes without saying that business skills are so important!
Fully agree it's crucial to learn how the business makes money and learn how to clearly articulate how what you want to do will help the company make more of it. :D
KEN is the BEST üöÄ
Ken I have a really important question. Are Data Structures and Algorithms important for Machine Learning?
Really nicely explained! Thanks for the video. üôå
How to talk to different people? If someone is good in this skill things can get more easier. I think, Communication is an art as it's the first step... I myself find how can I make more improvements to my communication skills while working in industry.
Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about "understanding each other" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group. 

With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different "data" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that.

You are doing great work popularizing the field and making data science accessible to more people, Ken.

Thank you! =)
Great video Ken! Completely agree with the points you raised - these are so underrated!
Ask open-ended questions and follow-up with questions based on their responses.
Thanks for the awesome video! Please make a video on how to talk to different audiences! It will be helpful to us (and you will earn a lot of loyal subscribers ;) )
Thanks for your very informative video :) I'm very technical, so it was very helpful for me :) I would also be interested in a video about how to talk with different people :)
Excellent video of an often overlooked aspect of business.
This helps to mitigate the "we don't know how to measure what we care about, so we care about what we measure" issue.
Ehhh, we can always improve, but I wouldn't take that much blame.  If you are trying to help them and they'll only give you one word answers, they're just being jerks.
Yaaay Hermione‚Äôs time turner made it Haha ! Amazing video Ken thank you !!
I think business strategy is important for data scientists, and then learning to deal with ambiguity. Business majors are great at dealing with ambiguity where as technical people such as engineers, data scientists etc struggle with a lot. By ambiguity, I mean that in business, 1 + 1 does not equal 2... it could equal 3 or 5 or -2.
The business attire sets a different kind of vibe. I was looking forward to this video. Great content as always üòå
Fantastic video Ken. Excellent tips and ideas on business skills. Inspiration is key to learning and Youtube, blogs and books are a perfect way of getting you out the blocks fast. Thanks for the mention. All the best Mike
I love all these Points.
When i newly joined a company and i have to understand the working of sql structure if the company and find insights from report was hard becuase i was not aware of deep level of understanding of how exactly the company internally works and then my manager included me in his meetings and from there i started talking other department co worker about thier job and contribution which helped me a lot in my jobüíØ.and Looking Fancy Ken , we are rooting for ken with suit in further video hahaüòÜ.
This is one of the most underused skills to have.

You can't solve a business problem if you don't understand the business
talk to people- something the online class attending gen z and millennials are not so confident aboutüòîalso nice sound effect on that part  haha
Excellent insights!
I‚Äôm interested in data science but I work in healthcare currently, would I have to go back to school?
Man, I missed this, but how great it is to see Ken and Josh in the same video =) Also, Ken, is there a video about top data science events? As a newbie, I would like to attend some of those to improve my network.
Thanks for watching everyone! I would love to hear what projects you're working on in the comments section below! 
If you want some more project advice, check out my project beginners playlist! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASt4dLSAd2FMoY3Og3V0jZv
Thanks for this Ken. The key takeaway, " it's important to wrestle with your data and not give up"
Keep ‚Äòem coming Ken! Cheers from NZ
ah I thought you were gonna say you never did it :x
I'm not a data analyst or anything but just the idea of having an automated judge was enough to make me watch the whole thing haha
Hi Ken. I am a undergrad student and I am deeply interested in Data science. In final year, should I do thesis or do project on data science?
ThanksInAdvance
Such useful insights for beginners! 
Thanks, Kenüôå
Lol, for my research project in grad school I wrote some models based off of LSA, GloVe, and Word2Vec and the best accuracy I got was 16% from w2v. My LSA model was scoring at 4% lmao. it was hilariously bad. It really was humorous to me just how bad they were performing. I was able to (over some grueling months) get my W2V model up to 65% accuracy which for the task at hand, I still consider to be quite good honestly.
Thank you so much for your great content, Ken! I enjoy your channel so much. I'm kind of an outlier here. LOL I did a masters in statistics in the 80's and then was a statistical consultant for agricultural projects using SAS for several years. After a 35-year hiatus from formal data analysis (but not from thinking data and teaching math) I came back last year to complete a data science certification to try to get up to speed in the data world. Wow! What a challenge!

I did one big project for my certification, but I want to do several more for my own benefit and for my portfolio before I start looking for contracts. Your videos give me lots of possibilities. I just really enjoy how you present ideas. Thank you again.
Great video Ken! Can definitely relate to your thumbnail when I was working on my first project lol üòÇ
Hey Ken, I've been enjoying your videos! Great channel you have by the way. I'm currently a junior in college, pursuing a degree in mathematics and I have a interest in the data science field. I've taken a couple of programming classes like intro to computer science and predicative analytics and I still plan to learn more on my own free time. Will employers still prefer a computer science major over a math major? What are your thoughts?
Failures and bad experiences are what I need to hear as a junior. Because that's what happens to me mostly and everyone talks about good things happened to them which is unreal.
HE'S BACK!! Awesome vid Ken!
ü§î"If you knew then what you know now" (or even recreate the same project now) could you do a better job or is predicting the judging on a match just a 50% success? Also, did your model take into consideration the judges themselves as (in)consistent variables?

Everyone's first attempts at something don't look good as subsequent efforts, particularly after years of experience. Do you apply how you've "failed" (even today) to improving your skills or possibly utilize the failure data as part of your model(s)?
Is most code for almost all projects just copied from one source or another, and we just change the parameter values  ,like epochs, or batch_size? Or is there something else, regarding making projects?
He is back üî•üî•
Thanks Ken! I'm just starting my first data project for grad school and it's still in the data collection phase. I have a team of four undergrads working for me so right now I'm still trying to figure out what it is I'll want to analyze and present to the grant makers but we have some time to figure that part out.

Do you have any advice for the pre-planning phase of research? I feel more comfortable in my coding than I do in project management but in this case, it's all part of the same project.
But talkin ‚ú®g about something purely my idea .
I think I had problem with defining the problem statement and looking for right data . I just use to see the topic I want to work on and not on the problem statement. And secondly also I use to just take data if it's related to the topic and not to the problem statement biggest mistake . Took me a lot of time to get out of this mindset
Thank you so much for sharing, Ken.
I love the MMA data set. Also, MMA math never works.
Thanks for sharing your experience... 

Data science is all about keep going with lots variation until we get results which can make impact on our purpose.
I have really lost count of all the data science mini projects I've done, now I need to do a major one :life:
Hey welcome back... I must say... The quality of video improved alot... The editing and all other things are seems more better üôå
Gosh even though we have the podcast this type of videos hits differently. Glad to see u back here Ken ! Also 2:08 was hilarious haha .. I would love to work on a cooking project for my next one, I'll share it with the community when I'm done :)
That's exactly the thing i am facing right now, thanks.
Glad to see you Ken, thanks for sharing your learning experience of your first project. This video is so good, gotta take some notes:
1. Start that first project, rinse and repeat
2. Wrestle with your problem and don‚Äôt give up too early
3. Don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes, experiment and learn from it
4. Embrace failure and take it as a learning opportunity
5. Ken‚Äôs tips: project planning, problem definition, documentation, clear communication and sharing your work
Great video Ken, it's something I struggle with too having a specific goal in mind. Its the most important thing in any project. Also love the Ryder Cup shirt Europe will come back swinging next time lol!
Welcome Back! It's been a long timeüòÄ
Just what I needed to hear üòä
Yeeeaaa here again¬°¬°¬°
Thank you for watching and special thanks to atoti for supporting the channel! Install the module here for Free: https://docs.atoti.io/latest/installation.html
Hi Ken, I am new with data analytics and would like to know if there is a specific platform/brand that you can suggest that have a data warehouse, data gathering, forecasting, and visualization all in one? Thanks!
Hi ken jee, just a quick question‚Ä¶.what‚Äôs the best way to scrap data from more than 10000 urls in a short period of time‚Ä¶..i have a project where every url takes around 1 sec to extract data but the urls are sooo damn many that it takes ages‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is there any solution to this problem‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I like the visualization video i think i have already commented about it but i had a question what is most used s visual libraries  which has better visualization option? 
i have been using matplotlib and seaborn for a while but i know i have to go with trend of plotly so do you think plotly something worth learning when you already know matplotlib and seaborn?
Thank you!!
I love your channel, thanks very much
Bro which is good? bachelors in data science and analytics or bachelors in computer science or BTech computer science with data science
Could you please clarify  if It's required to study data science to become business analyst? Thx you for your help in advance.
@ken jee
I want to start on with data science,
I know only basics python,
Please give me your advice to step into data science and where to start please.
ggplot2 gang ASSEMBLE!
What i learn for data science Ai or machine learning??
Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA  in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python‚Ä¶) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on what‚Äôs best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks
Just started a Module in my Google Data Analytics Course where I get to learn about Data Visualisation. As a kid I was always into sketching, colouring or some form of Imagery. As I grew up I could identify and nurture my storytelling skills. So far, with whatever I have read and learnt about Data Visualisation it seems like a party for an art and design lover like me who also loves storytelling. And this video of yours nails it to the end. I just hope I do well and make the most of data visualisation Module now.
Just found this channel. Im an Applied Math major exploring my options. I gotta say, the formatting and filming are done very well! Seems like a trustworthy place that i'll be coming back to.
Thanks Ken!
My Data Visualization skills are what got me my data science job!
Hey everyone. Anyone know of any worthwhile data science/analytics certifications worth pursuing?
Hey Ken , I really like data science and SQL but unfortunately I am not super strong at math or coding, what would you suggest . Also python makes me cry , can I bevome an analyst without learning python
Sir my qestion is can i become data scientist without any degree?
can all of your data science vidoes and tips be applied to data analytics?
Great video!
While watching I came across one quote

Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories.
‚ÄïAl Shalloway üôå
I was very surprised and impressed when I saw the graphs and visualisation in trading apps... They are very helpful to understand many tiny aspects and indeed looks beautiful üòç
Great video Ken couldn't agree more man. Data visualisation is the key translation tool for data scientists -> business stakeholders. Keep it up dude
Hi ken
I had a question
how often  do data scientists use object oriented programming in their work?
"Data Vis" or "Data Viz"? I'd like to think the cool kids like to add a 'z' to the end üò≥ü§£üòâ
Solid. Ty
Fantastic video Ken. Really enjoyed watching this. Keep up the good work!
Data Visualization is an art and a science in itself! And well, who says no to looking at some beautiful drawings and pictures?
"A graph is worth a thousand tables" even if the tables are stored in a graph database? üòú
I see no lie
Dammit I was looking forward to what argument you would give if no üßêüòÖ
As a product person who loves data and data visualizations I love your video. Maybe one question, how do you work with your data scientist if repeatedly asking for easy to understand dashboards and typically we get dashboards that take minutes to interpret each graph and explain repeatedly? I know product people can be cryptic as well ü§£ love your vids Ken!
While "a picture is worth a thousand words", the RIGHT picture is far more meaningful as many artist / photographers might point out.


I recently did an assessment where lots of questions were about which visualization conveyed a particular point or what statement is represented.
Visuals makes everything understandable and presentable üíØ
Very informative ken loving this üéâ
3:38 The "papaya plot" is certainly a great alternative to the "pie chart" and "is extremely effective for conveying complicated info in a digestible way". üòÜ
Jokes aside, this is a nice and concise video on the importance of data viz. It is certainly one of the funnest part of a data science project, sometimes I would be lost in the zone of customizing plots for countless hours.
Would this be a correct analogy?
Data Analyst = Front-End
Data Engineer = Back-End
Data Scientist = Full Stack
I love to see Data visualizations in everything ! I remember as a child I used to play soccer on PlayStation 2 a lot, and they had plenty of charts like radar charts for players and teams to rank them by skill (attack, defense, speed, ... ), trees to rank players and clubs in different leagues, soccer fields with different sized circles to show ball possession ... It was awesome, we would literally spend 10 minutes before each match just looking at the graphs to choose the best Formation. I don't think we would've liked PS2 as much without those visualizations, even as kids they generated high value for us as consumers and for the company as a business.
I can't imagine data science without data viz o.o
Viz 5: 

"Data = yes, opinion = no"
So which papaya did you end up choosing at 01:48 haha
Hi ken.. I just wanna ask is it must to learn plotly dash dashboards.. Or I can skip.. Becz i dnt know y but i m not able to understand them.. üòï
Hey 
Ken jey 
I started with kaggle courses
Going great so far 
‚ù§
"One graph is worth a thousand tables". Couldn't agree more on this, great video Ken!
Glad you said yes. You were about to have a r/dataisbeautiful mutiny on your hands lol
Really useful üíØ
Yesterday I had a presentation in front of some managers where I showed what we did in our team in the last 12 weeks. I am the only data scientist who also does frontend engineering work and I can tell your guys that the difference between a "ah nice job" and "wow this is awesome" is when people are able to SEE the results. We are very visual creatures, never forget that :-)
Omg üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I am coming to just write that i just had meeting about my data science project with mt CEO and let me tell you they literally confused me by complicating it haha.
Do you think is possible to find a remote job as a data analyst if I am in another country (not USA)
So which is the actual default hair Luke üòÇ
His tie just said it allüòÇ
The model accuracy part was the most relatable XD
KEN JEE sir ! can you please do a sports analytics project video ! PLZZZZZZZZZ
@KenJee  just wants unlimited, free papaya and does not care how machine learning engineers' lives have to be sacrificed.  < /sarcasm >
When I first heard the inflation bit I was rofl :3
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Getting approval in first go is like miracle üòå
hi ken, can you give me a challenge for my "youtubers control my life for 24hrs video?" :D
I just reliased I have same spectacles as kenü§≠.
Funny afffü§£üíØ
That 3% is unrealistic imo
The end screen though hahaha
Loving these expectations vs reality videos
accurate
so what you are saying is freelance right away??
Yep. It's even worse when you are a consultant hahaha
Yeah, pretty much. üòÇ
How is great learning data science pg course for a guy from non technical background please guide sir üôè
Relatable üòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's why my company encourages async communication ü§£
Very relatable ü§£
hahaah great this is going on my memes playlist
happend to me so many times :D
Reality and not funny when you‚Äôre under the pump and you have to present the next day zzzz lol
Ken and Luke, This is hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ I can 100 % relate to the access issues...
*gets a text message from the manager at 11:00pm* "can you please check your email real quick?" Classic one lol
Why does this feel like deja vu ü§£ü§≠
I may have accidentally deleted that email Mr. Jee sent me. üò≥
Wait, what? No random CSV sent without column headers and no context?!

Excellent video. I talk about this all the time with my closest friends.
My problem with learning something is that i'm a student in an uni, but the subjects that i learn are not correlate with something i'm chasing. I'm strongly interested in data science, because my mind works in a way that i process and analyse information and i see everything in my life as an information that i need to analyse, process, and make my decisions based on conclusions that i come to after analysing. But. In the uni, although it's connected to programming, and now i'm quite capable of learning anything, no matter how complex subject is, but i get stuck on a wall of why's and not finding answers. So as a result, i'm a mediocre student, that passes tests just to pass them and not having any problems with my university. 

I now, that, if i'm interested, i get to be very submerged into what is interested to me. I was able to learn drawing, palying instrument, or learn to play sport games in quite a short time, but when it gets to learn something that i don't see as interesting to me, no matter how hard i would try, i understand that i will have to burn myself out in order to learn something that i just can't see useful for me anyhow in the future. And i try to find answers for how that would be useful for me, but i fail. 

And now that i gave up on trying to become a good student, that knows things that won't really be useful to me, i want to focus on something that no matter of if i have a degree or not, i know that i will be able to play on the skills that i learn myself. So for now the main question for me is in building that study path, where i can get the necessary things that will pay off in the future. Like, where can i find topics for my personal projects, where can i get experience for what i myself really want to learn. Will the courses that i have on the internet really be useful for me in the future. 

To conclude this, i found out that i'm not good at studying actively, but good at studying passively. Like, it's very easy for me to get burnout if my study is percieved for myself as something that i NEED to spend time, focus on that, isolate myself from other things for the particular amount of time. But. When i can ease myself from these walls that i build myself and if i can just implement Passive learning of something, for example, through simple videos like yours when i watch YouTube, just get to be on the flow with my pure curiosity of things, this exact interest, that gets me to deep no matter how down, is just building on itself and then i lose the track of time how many hours i spent just researching something that was just interesting for me, and i never got tired of that, and if not my biological needs, like, to eat, to sleep, i know that i could research something forever. So, that side of me i usually call a passive learning, where you don't get those walls in your mind, that you Have to focus, that you have to concentrate, that you have to put away all the distractions, and the interest of learning something is just comes to you on itself. And if i push myself to learn something, i WILL have to push myself against the immediate mind response, that this work will be monotonous and exhausting. It's a problem of learning for me, and as far as i understood through trying to fool myself, my mind, etc. is that everyone is finding it's own ways to learn things and builds it's own systems of how they can get to learn some sort of skills.
Yeah, the first thing to learn is "how to learn"
YEP ! This is my Path . Wow  fits perfect üëå üëå
Noiceee
I can relate to a lot of points that you said, esp going to the gym and having that "like" button clicked, thus improving efficiency even further. Amazing video and thank you for your insights!
OMG this video was so inspiring! I know that i'm intelligent but I was always an average student and convinced myself that school wasnt for me. Even though I really want to finish. Thank you for this! <3
Thanks for this video
This has been one of the most valuable videos of yours I have seen. A lot of us struggle with these things and the imposter syndrome is the hardest for me. It's nice to see someone in this field being realistic about life and themselves.
I can confirm that Ken was a standout student in my microeconomics class! üòÄ  I'm referring to minute 4:00 in the video. I love that the course stirred something in you and played a role, however small, in your life journey.  Your video is incredibly insightful and spot on. I plan to show this video to my micro classes since I think many students face many of the same roadblocks to their success that you overcame.  You have done so much since then. I am in awe!  Way to go, Ken!
How to go from meta-learning to landing jobs at  META. üòõüòÄ
When I first saw the hoop I was like "This fool is about to dunk" haha
Beautiful video! So many nuggets in one video.
Thanks Ken Jee, That was  insightful
If you really want to improve your sense of purpose in life, Read Qur'an.
You are so resilient and Unstoppable. Thank you for sharing your journey man. I am following your journey since long. All the best . Keep inspiring us. I am at a crucial stage of my early 30's where SELF learning is so inevitable for survival . *You and Tina are my favt people on YT* .
Do you cover how to read better in another video? I found the explanation in this video kinda confusing but would absolutely love to learn how you did it!
Not only does Ken produce a great video but he also puts a short summary in the description. A moment of appreciation for that
Nice video Ken Jee.
Gretteings to you from Lima /Per√∫!
Hi, Do I need to get BS if I want to work for data scientist?
Hey Ken Jeee! I just love your videos and it realy help me not to give up on learning Data science for good.
Ken, this was an absolutely exceptional video. So well done
I have recently come to the conclusion that data science is the best job fit for me and started watching educational materials about it, including yours. I am so happy that our stories are a bit alike. After graduating an elite high school some of my friends went to Oxford or big European capitals, while I went to a more peripheral university, where I briefly majored in I.T. and Psychology before finally switching to Business & Economics, but even that is (still) going very slowly because of struggles with motivation and lack of purpose. Statistics used to be black magic to me back when I took my first course. Then the second course likewise went easier, and I started to grow fond of the subject! I, too, have stopped thinking I am inherently bad at math. Thank you for giving me hope that I might yet make it!
This is fantastic man, I am in the same boat and looking to be a great learner and grow. Wonderful tips!
Hello Ken, I noticed you said in the comments section once that some consulting firms would sponsor master degree for data analyst to become date scientist. Would you please elaborate on that‚Äî what kind of firms would typically do that besides consulting firms? What are some firm names you know ? I googled but only found the big 4 sponsor mba and sometimes google partially sponsor master and Microsoft sponsor UW master, nothing data science related tho‚Ä¶. Thank you so much! I love your videos and gained so much information, much appreciated and hopefully I can hear back from you:)
Thank you so much for such great encouraging video, much needed!
One of my favourite videos of yours thus far.
I think everyone should talk about how they learn and everyone should aim to get better at learning. Very helpful thanks
thank you for sharing your journey. It's super helpful for a c straight student in statistics like me. I've given up several time yet run to it again and again  through my work
Cool ideas. thanks Ken.
That wink tho
14:03 "...and the confusing success I was having with my gym habits now all became CLEAR". Missed opportunity.
Thank you for taking the time to make this video and share it with us!
Thanks Ken! Lesson 7 on projects is probably the most valuable one. That article you displayed, "this will make you understand how hard data science really is", is trapped by that fallacy: you can only be really really good at something if you know all the stuff about it. That's a very academic mindset and I found that in the real world outside college, it's not what you know, it's how well you can solve problems (aka finish projects). You don't need to know things from the top of your head if you have learned how to find and process information fast. If I had known that in university I probably would've been a lot happier and relaxed about my future.
Awesome !
awesome video!! I'll definitely try the speed reader and read the book recommendations!
Yes, this is for sure one of the most helpful videos I've ever watched. Thank you, Ken!
I've developed a growth mindset in my early 30's. It's never too late! Thanks, Ken for the great video!
Wow the way you spent the first half of this video talking but saying nothing I started to think this was an advertisement for something.
Thanks for sharing your incredible journey with us on this platform. Very relatable..with every tiny step we make forward in the right directions, it gives us immense confidence to keep it going and change our belief about ourselves. Thanks once again. Yes, Learning is a Journey !!! Something I really needed to hear today.
ANYHING'S POSSIBLEEEEE
Thanks for the deep thoughtful information u shared with us
Amazing video @Ken Jee! I love it that I'm finding most of your story super relatable to mine! üòäAlso, my most favourite part of the video is 10:55 ü§£ü§£
I‚Äôve enjoyed watching this episode üôåüèΩ. I especially like the one for finding your flow to get maximum learning. Thank you for sharing the lessons
Hi! I'm looking for a course about basketball analytics, anyone knows one?
Do you think that being a Data Analyst is a good starting point to become a Data Scientist later? I'm asking because I'm able to get my very first IT job as a Data Analyst but I want to be a Data Scientist in the future.
Sir want your guidance. I just passed my high school. Can i apply for data scientist or data analytics through online courses or should I have degree.????????plz ans   what should i do next???
Impressive! Another awesome video Ken! Thanks for keeping it real and sharing your story.
üëçüëçüëç
As always Ken thank you for your insight. You have been a great inspiration to me.
I resonate so much from your journey.... I took statistics in my undergrad because I thought I would learn mean median mode but the new statistics turned my mind upside down ü§™.... But there's always something that I m still figuring out that make me love the subject despite not liking the high level maths plus variables. though not afraid of maths at all
Crazy journey! Thanks for the learnings!
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLLLLLLEEEEEEEE!!!!
I see job postings on linkedin for data scientist roles that find MA degrees in Economics acceptable, I'm currently an undergrad studying Honours Economics and minoring statistics, while taking some courses in SQL, Python, and R. I am very passionate about Economics and for sure want to do a Masters, but am unsure whether to get a masters in Econ or Data Science as I feel Econ may not prepare properly for DS, but that Data Science would limit career opportunities. Any feedback is appreciated.
Hi kenjee, what do think about writing white paper and how can the audience and author benefit from a white paper at this point of time.
What a journey ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Love the opener; I thought for sure you were going to make that shot! ha! STAY HARD!!
Are you David gogggins of data science?? stay hard!!!
I David gogggins my math degree
But how do I learn how to meta-learn?
It's like the story of my life :3 I am also an Econ graduate, I like soccer and cooking, At the moment I'm preparing for the TOEFL and GRE exams, and I'm a bit slow in reading :3 But all this doesn't matter anymore cuz you have been giving us shortcuts like this video so we can better understand ourselves :p Also loved the fun bits you put throughout the video. Finally, May your cousin rest in peace and find happiness in the afterlife :)
Battling impostor syndrome with positive self talk is a great tip. At times, I always get discouraged but speaking positively out loud and even writing positive remarks down about myself always helps.

I'm a huge believer of Growth Mindset as well! What you truly believe is what will most likely happen. It's always important to have confidence in yourself because only YOU 
can make the future you want for yourself a reality!
My uncle always tell me that learning is a one thing which you should never stop doing.

 Learning new things helps us to increase knowledge, improve personality and many things üôå
Great journey Ken... This video will spread positivity and inspiration among us. 

Sad to hear about your cousin... Sometimes keeping ourselves strong in those situations is really in hard but he will be definitely proud of you as you are inspiring, motivating and helping many learners around the world. 

Some incidents brings huge change in our life.

Thank you üôå‚ô•Ô∏è
"How this is possible that adding something to my schedule, actually created more time for me" <3
like it
Love this Ken ‚ù§Ô∏è
Such a great, motivational video!
I really liked when you mentioned that one of the most important aspects of meta-learning is to realize that we are capable of growth. Thanks for sharing your personal story and journey, Ken! It is indeed very inspirational.
"Don't compare your results to others if you can't study their process". Thanks Ken, Amazing video! Can you share your reading list about learning?
Great video as usual! It‚Äôs funny how we are almost always our own worst enemy.
I continue to avoid trying projects and at times lose all my motivation for learning. 

My job is comfortable right now, but I know things can change fast, and in the long run I need to skill up while also working towards a more fulfilling and rewarding career! I just need to get out of my own way. This video was a great reminder!
How does one become a quick learner or how do you know if you are?
I HAVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST IN A VIDEO‚Ä¶. THANK YOU
Kkkkkkkkkkkk
You really funny, I Love your videos.
I was in a hiring process and got reproved... but, then I realized that I want to work with data science for sustainable development, that is it. I am very environmenntalis.
Liked and saved in my advice list.

Omg! This is my story!!!
Thank you so much for making these videos for us!
I am impressed by this video, especially the parts about habits and "learning about learning."  As to sound during study, I don't do well with any music or speaking that I understand; random sounds (beaches, rain, wildlife, radio noise) is better.  LOL, if there's silence, my mind wanders into some distracting worries...
I was so happy to hear that someone also put just silent earphones to get some focusüòäüòäüòÄüòÄNice video ken jee and thank you for the booksüòâüòâ
You guys call squash racquetball??? üò≥
Amazing - super motivating as always!
"Learning will always be a journey. If you become a learner and you find a way to enjoy the process, you'll become successful in almost everything that you do." ‚ÄìKen Jee
Awesome video Ken! Really interesting to learn how adding a habit (going to the gym) helps to add structure and routine (pre- and post- workout) to your day. This habit stacking is a powerful thing indeed.
Duuuuuude I was rockin a 2.5 for three years of college now I am about to finish a mechanical engineering degree with a 3.45 GPA learning to learn is definitely a process. Now I am almost halfway done with the google analytics course and I‚Äôm doing ML in 30 days. Thanks for your videos, information and inspiration!
summary

1. growth mindset - belief you can improve. overcoming fixed mindset
2. his close friend passed away had him realize that life is short, and he should do something meaningful within short time given to him -> identify your purpose
3. overcoming "imposter syndrome" by self-talking with positive words.
4. decide your identity and you will behave according to your identity automatically.
5. just like a game, create proper environment for studying, set a clear goal, give immediate feedback to stay focused
6. practice how to read -> ended up enjoy reading -> helped studying
7. create a simple routine first -> add routines/habit gradually. busy you get, more efficiency in time consuming. 
8. there are vast areas you could study. your time & energy is limited. therefore, narrow it down to specific area you're really interested in, and dig into it.
Ken, thanks for producing such a valuable content! I came across your channel about a months ago while searching videos about data science. You inspired me to start a course on DS and finally start taking actions. Moreover, I greatly enjoy your approach to producing content not only about DS, but also about other relevant topics, such as learning and tracking personal productivity. Again, thank you for sharing your experience and running this channel!
Thanks Ken, a lot of great insights on meta-learning (which we should start applying) üôå üëäüíØ 
and now, ladies and gentlemen, this is how you directly apply learnings related to self-talk, cinematography and video-editing **Ken's wink** üòâ!
Great video, Ken! I can relate to the inability to listen to music with words while I study. There's too much conflict in my mind that I can't focus on the subject at hand.
Welcome to the video where Ken talks about meta learning and also flexes his golf skills ü§†ü§†ü§†

Ye I relate to that journey as I had kinda similar circumstances and it's important to have the push when you need the most.

That self talk tho!! Loved it XD **Ken's wink wink**
Some serious points which I need to note down and take action on it üíØ
Thank you Kenüôå
Amazing as always!!
Must have been really hard time for you when your cousin passed away but glad you fought through it. 
Anyone reading this, just remember hard times doesn't last forever, so don't give upüí™üèº
Last time I was this fast ~ 
Anyway the video gives very Tina vibes for some reason XD
My master playlist is over 1350 songs long. I keep repeatedly getting the songs I have recently added each time I shuffle play üòÇ I have heard the most recent one at least 10 times today alone üòÇüò≠
humans dont actually like randomness. at least for music
Nah i hate that cause i have 20 hours of music on my playlist and somehow always get the same damn songs
Is anything "randomly" generated by a computer really random
Zach star made a video in which he told about this , random dots created won't be random
Worked for roll20 (online site for playing DND) and the amount of people complaining their DND dice are cursed/blessed. üíØ Humans don't deal with randomness
No its because someones clearly hacking my account but nobody cares!
Now isn't that a nice example for the human concept of 'fate'
Short answer: You can‚Äôt code randomness, it doesn‚Äôt exist. You can only code things which feel like randomness to us, so basically how our brain understand it.

Long unclear answer: watch the video
came here from the newsletter :D
Hi, ken. do you recommend m1 MacBook for ml and deep learning?
Hi, can I use open source code (it doesn't have a license) in my app which I plan to make commercially available? Thanks
Something to think about ü§î
This video and a David Goggins video appeared side-by-side in my recommended videos.  It was a really hard decision but I obviously chose the more favorite one to watch! üòú Now I have to go run 100 miles to pay for this decision....
Would've never guessed that they implemented an algorithm that's actually less random, interesting.

I was just "randomly" thinking about this the other day too
I feel like my workout playlist always starts with the same 2 songs
Heres a pseudo code i developed in my stupid head for random songs.
import random
A=[0,1,2,...,N]# index of each song
#Or
for i in range(0,len(A)):
A={1:"Song 1",.....,N:"Song N"}
song_played=randrom.choice(A)
play(song_played)# plays the song
del A[song_played]

#Im not an expert ,so if there's anything #wrong please point out respectfully
So, Can we say that sometimes algorithms produce their own pattern or results which maybe be completely different from what we are expecting?
ü§î Yeah, have always wondered about that, thanks for demystifying this for us Ken! Thinking out loud, I can imagine that by chance a random selection may select songs by the same artist or from the same era and as you've mentioned Spotify probably imposes a filter for the aforementioned which makes it less random.
How interesting ! I can see how the algorithm would prevent a succession of songs by the same person. Although personally I have a personal playlist that I occasionally edit.
I think almost everyone who uses Spotify experienced this.
I spotted the random shuffle in 'Spoitfy'.
I have been questioning Spotify's shuffle algorithm for about two years now. I alway felt the shuffle algorithm on my IPod nano was better than Spotify's algo. I would hear repeated shuffled songs throughout a one to two hour time span on my Spotify playlist that has 1,500 songs. I wish they could fix that.
hey ken youve helped me get my life back on track. this whole 66 days of data has helped me form a schedule and study something that has some sort of value. your information has been very helpful. thanks man
Thanks for the live stream! The dinosaur shirt needs to be a sellable product on your website with your branding! It would sell!
Came for the papaya, stayed for the wisdom and wizardry! üî•üî• stream Ken, congrats to you and the community! If you haven‚Äôt already definitely read David Goggin‚Äôs book (Can‚Äôt Hurt Me) and Jesse Itzler‚Äôs book where Goggin‚Äôs lives with him for 30 days (Living with a Seal), I read them both and went a little H.A.M off the back of it and did an impromptu 65k ultra marathon last year. 

Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts:
1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24)
2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something you‚Äôre interested in and go for it (32:31)
3. Loved the fact that you both called out developing fundamental skills. Having a strong base allows you to move quickly and stay up to date with innovation in the field (51:50), I‚Äôm off to study LDA right now. 

N.b. Had a little freak out when you dropped the c word (c***right strike) üòÖ
Congrats once again on 150K subscribers Ken! I use your videos as a reference or to give me better general direction whenever I feel overwhelmed about the Data Science journey and I love how you:
- Talk about the more personal (softer) aspects of Data Science in the workplace or outside
- Live your personal life or measure up your daily routines/activities in a Data Science kind of way/approach!
which IDE did you used in the Data science project from scratch video?
Congratulations Ken! I really love your content, it's really helped me start learning data science, especially building the confidence to get over the sometimes intimidating parts of data science.  Doing the 66daysofdata challenge has been so helpful. You are incredibly inspiring!
Congrats on 150K!
Huge congrats for 150k!! Sorry I couldn‚Äôt make it ‚òπÔ∏è
Also, I would like to say thank you to you for your constant support and I'm really grateful for directing me towards a goal... One thing which I would like to highlight that you told in QnA that you like to apply your data science skills in your daily life which is really cool and useful to improving the thought process and maintaining a balance...
Congratulations Ken for 150 k üéâüéäüëè I was there in live stream initially... It was great üôåüòÅ
Congratulations 150k subcriber üéâ
You are doing amazing üíØ
36:25 is where ken eats the papaya I think xD
Congrats on 150k subs!! üéâ
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope it helps you to better understand how APIs work and why they are useful to us as data scientists. Definitely go check out the Tiff In Tech YouTube channel after finishing this video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4MZ7zUHb5eAxU75Dc_nqdQ
Great video explaining APIs and their importance, keep it up!
No thank you üòÅ
Thank you bro  about each word you talked it
Hey Ken! Any suggestions regarding a course related to API or data engineering stuff? Thank you!
Fire explanation!!
What should I choose between B.tech Cse with specialization in ai/ml engineering and B.tech Cse with specialization in data science?
If I had a dollar for every time I googled about API's... 








prolly just have like 50 dollars by now.
Your 5min videos are perfect for my pomodoro breaks.
They help me staying motivated on my journey to learn data science and become a data scientist ! üí™

Keep up the good work ! üëç
You mean that API does not stand for Automatic Pizza Ingredients? üòî
Great video! But completely unrelated, at my college I have a choice to get either a BA or BS in data science. Do you think employers care if I have one or the other? I‚Äôve been looking around online, but I feel like someone who is actually in the field would have the best idea.
Yess I always wanted to start with APIs uwu
WOAH no glasses!!

Haha but It's really amazing to see how much better your videos have gotten in the past year!  Loving the content Ken! 

#Roadto200K
@Ken, I would guess APIs will be needed for any software related profession going forward
That said, what's the deal with papayas üòè?
And could you consider a walkthrough of creating an API from a data science model as one of your future YouTube videos? Please consider adding it to your (probably already huge) backlog / list üòÖ
Your thumbnail is trash for a mobile viewers, which means not appealing to most of YouTube users. 

Note: Small font, and hard to understand thumbnail.
One thing I LOVE about your videos is you provide notes in the description so viewers don't have to scramble to copy down information spoken to quickly or flashed on the screen for a few seconds. (This of course is second to your sense of humor. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ @ 0:05 "Automatic Papaya Integration")

One suggestion / request: would it be possible to replace LONG URLs with tiny URLs? 
Cutting-n-pasting the description notes often leads to long URLs cut off with ". . ." at the end instead of the full URL text. The only choice is to manually go to each site and copy the full URL for later reference.
Some topics for video are,
1. How will Automation affect IT jobs?
2. Where do you see data science after next 10 years?
Very helpful, thanks!
Like FAST API, Ken may make PAPAYA API...
API is like ready to eat food...üòâ
Great video, Ken! Tiff has some great videos too, thanks for recommending her channel.
Crystal clear explanation from both you Ken and Tiff. Aside from being the best way to get access to data, API is also the best way to automatically acquire papayas ü§£
Hey, Nice explanation. 
Can you make a  video of #shorts about statistics concepts.
Notes from the video
‚Ä¢API : Application programming interface
‚Ä¢API is basically messenger between two applicants. It recieves a request from the user and we get the response
‚Ä¢It is important for data scientist's because of :-
a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API
b) reliable and consistent
c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API
d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models) 
‚Ä¢How to use an API? 
Find a documentation for an API of your interest and send a request to API
‚Ä¢How to make API? 
Create a basic web server that takes requests and returns responses
Hi Ken Jee
can you add subtitle for this video?
Maybe a dedicated video on freelancing as a data scientist?
It is very important but still a hard concept to grasp üíØüôå
Great video Ken ! API creation is an area that I should look into soon. Also you look great with or without glasses :)
Of course. API stands for AUTOMATIC PAPAYA INTEGRATION
Good one üëç.. thanks for sharing..
Such a timely video. 

Is there a tree of some sort that outlines the branches of learning you should take for a data science job?
I am literally seeing this video while using YouTube api to get my data lol
Thanks for watching everyone! If you enjoyed this one, you might also like my video on how the youtube algorithm works (from a data science perspective): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbTMIxjk4hI&ab_channel=KenJee
With the topic, of phones and devices listening and knowing Data Scientists use this information, is one issue I come into with family and friends. They think I'm going to work for Big Brother who is listening in all the time and crossing some acceptable boundary. It's a hard topic to argue with.
Didn't Samsung get caught doing this on smart TV's?
I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. 
However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. "Ok google", or "hey Siri" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in.
Lmao that thumbnail looked so funny with ears on a phone
B.tech in cse data science or btech in ai ml which has better scope and diversity?
What should I choose between B.tech Cse with specialization in ai/ml engineering and B.tech Cse with specialization in data science?
Where's the Jeff shirtless cameo?!
Watching this video for the 3rd time, this topic is just too much interesting
#1 it's illegal you're basically wiretapping unless the EULA lawyers get you to agree to be monitored all the time *cough *cough.
@Ken Jee, if this is really the case that companies (like Google, Facebook) are planning to limit the amount of tracking in one way, does it point to the fact that they are already using other means of tracking and who knows if that's more invasive
As people (aspiring and/or working) in the Data Profession, it's probably up to us to use the algorithm more efficiently üòè, but who can say the same for others?
Which curved monitor do you use?
It's also been suggested that phones and other devices aren't actually listening to US but high pitched tones in the audio of TV and radio programming and commercials. Just one more way to get insight into consumers' likes and dislikes. 

Personally, while I don't like the idea of eavesdropping and / or collecting my data (not that we probably haven't already given permission in the fine print of the voluminous service agreements), but I do wish if they ARE going to use the information they're gathering they would do a better job of suggesting things I'd actually want instead of things I DON'T want. Unfortunately we're years away (hopefully) from "Minority Report" where sensors identify us as we walk around and deliver targeted ads on the fly.
Man... now I wonder how they measure the level of friendship you have with someone and if they try to model the parts of your behavior that are unknown to them, through the behavior of the people you hang out with. Insanely cool and scary stuff, and ethically quite questionable.
What a naive view of the world... of course they are listening... that's not even a question anymore.
stop lying - you're clearly talking to Jeff (I'm pretty sure that's Jeff right?) about how you really wan to buy more papayas and Jeff telling you that you have a problem <3
I can‚Äôt believe you said ‚Äúdata‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdata‚Äù
I think you are a bit na√Øve - 90% of people who can do something profitable but naughty without reasonable fear of getting caught simply do it. Endless university social experiments have proven this. I think that when they do it, they make sure it is hidden behind layers of plausible deniability - so the component that listens is purchased from a third party and it was some 'bad man hacker from Russia' who broke into the server room through the roof and so on. They will make sure their reputation stays clean even if it means running a 'black ops' operations where the people who do the work have no idea who they are working for. Only an Edward Snowden type event will blow the lid off - and that will be very unprofitable for the individual concerned.
For a while less reputable apps were playing and listing for sounds above human hearing limits. They could tell who you were associating with outside of the digital world and then sell that info to whoever wanted it.
What about Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking?
Thank you so much for the awesome video. Now I have my thoughts neatly wrapped up and presented, so I can share this with my friends now
Why are there Papayas every where. I have never heard of Easter Papayas.
Yes Ken, It is true that if someone came across random ads then it's actually irritating so suggestions based upon our interest are sometimes valuable...

The only point is we need to use technology efficiently which will make the whole process intresting üòâ
Psh, I ain't worried about companies listening through the phone.... I'M WORRIED KEN JEE IS LISTENING THROUGH MY PHONE, AS I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS SAME VIDEO!!!!  üò≥üò≥üò≥
If I search something (for example chocolate), then soon after, my husband and my son will get ads for chocolate in their phones.
Haha hilarious 4:06 and 4:52. Great insights on this mysterious occurrence of this seemingly phone listening in to us. Love the new video format!
Insightful video. I've got smart ho e devices and I do believe Google assistant has the tech to listen in on my conversations, but if I'm getting value out of it, then I tend to just let it be. I'll use/allow certain platforms to have access and not others. We have somewhat of a control over how our info is shared, but it's not right in front of us. Hope Apple, Google, and others can make it more clear and simple how to control tracking. 

Excellent video to watch before bed. Have a good weekend. üôè
Great stuff üíØ
not just listening but spying with cameras too ü§≠, on a serious note ken that search history of papayas made me rethink my life choices
Great video, Have you seen the social dilemma documentary?
Utter bullshit. Speech recognition is computationally cheap, otherwise there wouldn't be such things as Siri. Companies don't pay for these computations, because your phone does them
All I can see and hear is papaya, papaya, and papaya
Great video ken always wondered about this.
Totally Agree with you!!! üôåüíØ
Man technology is scary, I can't even imagine where the technology will be in year 2050
Hey Ken, just want to say thanks for putting out so much good content. I‚Äôm currently working on my first real world project through school for a local company and having channels like yours to reference is a life saver.
Your explanation makes a lot of sense when you look at it from the outside. The bandwidth needed to listen and store all audio to target ads is beyond comprehension. 

Look, Google gets the lionsshare of their revenue from advertising. I believe it's in the 90% range. If they aren't helping business owners grow their businesses, they stop making that money,  so if they tell you they are going to use less tracking on you, it's not out of the goodness of their heart.....it's because they can accomplish the same goals with less resources.
Haha love your sense of humor Ken ! For me I don't really mind what they do, I mostly only use LinkedIn and YouTube anyway .. I'd rather watch anime than scroll on facebook.
Btw loved the new video style idea !
They are listening and i can prove it. I don‚Äôt use Siri or any voice search. My phone and chat programs and 100% of everything I do on it is in English.  I haven‚Äôt so much as typed a French translation into my phone.  However after a night at a friends with our kids I had been speaking a bit of French to him and the kids. The next two days several French ads started appearing when browsing and recommended videos on French started appearing on YouTube.

Now some of you might think, oh it's just that they used the "friend" algorithm and figured they would send you ads in french.  Except that I live in Thailand, and I don't get ads in Thai....why?  Because I don't speak any Thai and never have, despite obvious amounts of Thai being spoken around me, I never speak it so it has never picked up my voice speaking Thai.
does Siri still listen in constantly? but only for "hey Siri"?
Woah, love this. I had this question on my mind for quite sometime. You should debunk data related myths like these on your channel and probably call it data debunk something haha üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è
The ears in the thumbnail haha
Thanks for watching everyone! Would love to hear about the projects you're working on in your portfolios below!
Honestly, I prefer GitHub for documenting my Data Analysis project. But I'm having challenges uploading an image on my readme page. I have tried all the formats used by expert here on YouTube but none is working. I really need help üôè
Can we upload sql queries on kaggle?
Instructions unclear: I started making pizzas and left my Data Science career.
Add lights to your videos... The quality is bad
Keep messing with me talking about Data Science and showing pizza b-rolls. Hungry for knowledge and pizza‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I have a decent portfolio, a clean resume, and the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate with an MBA and 2 years as a financial analyst being advanced in Excel.

I also have some visuals on my Tableau public. Still getting rejections left and right. But I will make it as a data analyst/scientist.
5:45 what does she say here? I can't understand the accent
Great!!! Now I want pizza.  But . . . . . . which is best, pepperoni or Hawaiian?
Hey Ken
Im in a weird situation where the stuff im doing at uni is mainly in a team project or it can't be shown as it may be the answer to a potential future assignment (although I probably could just show it anyway). I dont have time between now and when I get an internship to do extra DS projects. How do I show off my skills if its part of a team project and some of the projects I've done at uni aren't very good? (We use bitbucket at university)
As always Great video ken.
Both Kaggle and GitHub are great, I agree with the complexity of GitHub for sure.
So you're not able to say which one is better for a portfolio, but which of Kaggle vs GitHub do you really use more on a day-to-day basis?
Had us at the pizza intro üçï
I have talked to quite a few employers that argued the same drawbacks for Kaggle. You do not get the data collection and production skills that really help your projects stand out as a true "end to end" project that shows off your problem-solving abilities. I personally love the resource as a place to practice and learn new skills while being able to collaborate and work together with others, however, GitHub has always been my go-to to highlight all the individual work I have done that I want to show off to employers!
You've done a great job in breaking down the details here, Ken! I agree though that Kaggle has a great community, better than Github. Nice video as always!
Can you send me over a pizza üôÇ
Ken, I took out the frustration on the like button. I have been Team GitHub for a while now. After seeing this and a few of your kaggle content, I am going to try Kaggle out. Also, your cooking and your new drone shots look good :)
Best advise from video - start with Kaggle and then turn to GitHub.
Here just to report this as my day thirty something for my #66daysofdata... Thank you very much Ken.
Fun fact: Hey Domino's, Can you sponsor this video?üòÅ
Hey, Ken... Thanks for the video üôå Best wishes to you üéâüéä 150 K soon ..

How many pizza have you baked for this video? üëÄüòÅ
Kaggle sometimes feels more interactive than GitHub no doubt GitHub is also very important and useful to showcase our work...
I am in love with GitHub
Hello ken jee I am your big fan and to learn data science from you .and want to start your #66daysofdata from you .
So I am requested to send me the link to get started with you.
Thanks üòä.
Peter Mckinnon makes coffee for his vids... Ken Jee makes pizza... I pick pizza over coffee... unless I can have both... cause then I'll take both
GitHub is my favourite social media
Thanks for the cool video)
I agree that the combination of these two platforms will give the best result, now I am creating a portfolio, I will upload better solutions from Kaggle to GitHub
Thank you for putting compared view for git & kaggle . It will help beginners to understand difference and importance
Hi completely agree with you.  Also thank you for video. 
I think creating kaggle profile is like "margherita pizza" without toppings, GitHub is messy similar to different types of topping & cheese,  & we have to properly add on pizza (similar documentation) but ,  it adds real taste in pizza.  
Finally Own portfolio is tells how well chef  you are in your cooking.
Reading some of our minds! I'm up at 2:00am pushing projects to Github and this video has assured me that Github is right for my projects and goals. You're awesome Ken! Bed time now.
Man I have to binge this videos to get my portfolio up to date
Nice breakdown of Kaggle vs GitHub, Ken!. In academia, it seems to be predominantly GitHub primarily for code/data sharing and version control. Really like your intro on the history of Kaggle and yes Kaggle does have some impressive free courses to learn about the data science stacks.
Working on a NLP project for my portfolio. I've started research on BERT. Kaggle has been a huge help since it has so many notebooks in one location
Thanks Ken!
Hey wait, sas that about Kaggle/Github or cooking? ;)
Hey Ken! 
Love all your content and completely agree üòä
I‚Äôm a fellow data scientist (and aspiring small YouTuber!) hoping to influence some more people out there in STEM üôÇ
ahahaha @tina huang ask Ken to do a full on cooking video, I still remember him eating the soup dumpling during your livestream and you appreciating his cooking skills
Thanks as a beginner I am struggling with how to make my portfolio not to mention kaggle is already confusing ,I have done 2-3 projects, like should I make my own website, or kaggle or GitHub or everything, it is so confusing and time consuming üò£ 
Also while I am making project I think of taking notes but that is so time consuming I am already dealing with bugs, at the end I am confused what all should I put in readme

I have done projects not made portfolio yet, mask detection, rasa chat bot and rl path finder
Great information!  I am on Kaggle but not GitHub yet.  Excellent point about it being a skill we need to know.  I will check it out.  It doesn't hurt to have two options!
Ken: Git can be messy; also perfectly spreads tomato sauce on the dough :3 .. Finally we got to see some of ur cooking :) Tina was right you can cook damn good üíô
As for the kaggle vs github debate, I put my projects on my portfolio website, and I chose github over kaggle because of the production part of projects
Jump to 5:09 if you are in a hurry
Ken flexing his cooking skills haha
Love from India‚ù§Ô∏è
Tldr; it doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî put either or both links on your CV ‚Äî focus on building great products üëç
I am hungry now after seeing the starting xD
First classüëç
What do you learn for 5minutes? Like 5minutes is too short to even read a page for some people, specially if its math.
I'm a Business Intelligence analyst working on Tableau. And would like to explore python for data science. Any inputs for getting started?
Such a simple, powerful concept! I‚Äôve always found that if you commit to do something daily for just a few minutes, you‚Äôll end up going over more often than not!
I just saw your other video and start doing the #66DaysOfData challenge today.
Yeah, the intro was awesome! Do you know how to juggle, juggling papayas would make a great intro as well üòÜ
If you don‚Äôt start every video like this from now on I‚Äôm unsubscribing üòÇü§£ (also great tips btw)
out of topic :3 .. I also love cooking and I'd wanna see what you make üëÄ Maybe share with us in Data Dribble if possible ? Thanks !
I can't wait for round 3 of #66DaysofData!!

The first two rounds I've been unable to make it past even 15 days straight due to my focus on school.

Now that I've graduated and don't have to worry about assignments, I'm 100% READY to tackle round 3 full force.

Can't wait for July 1st!
can't wait to start #66daysofdata
You will gain Consistency from #66daysofdata üôå
Tiktok vibes üòâ
Hi Guys , do not forget to use Ken Jee's Notion template for the #66daysofdata its really great tool to plan your day ahead.
Loved the starting:)
Can't continue it now. Doing something elseüòî
66 reasons to start #66DaysofData
I‚Äôm going to start this today. See you all on Twitter.
We are going to rock ken:)
Hey Ken, had an idea. For your next or future shorts, if possible could you go over the importance of baseline and/or possibly the different ways to do a baseline ie: dummy regressor, classifier, and how it applies to random forest?
Missed this challenge twice...but this time let's do it! üî•ü§ûü§ù
Last time I joined you and I really had fun and learned a lot .. I really hope I can join u this time
Yayyyy!!
So excited for this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can't do it nowüò¢
Entrance exam soon
I will definitely join you next time though:)
I'm on my 53rd day and I must say it's been a blissful experience, thank you ken for this initiative
Such an amazing initiative Ken! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
Where to enroll for this data science challenge.  I am beginner..  Can you please tell from where we can enroll in this and also I was not  a part of any previous round.
Awesome üí•
Ken, can you make a video on roadmap for a beginner to learn data science from scratch. it will be really helpful for freshers like me.
Yaaaay i can start with you this time!!
How do we sign up ?
I'm at middle of #66days is that necessary to  restart my count i'm almost done 24 days  for challenge
Great news. I am planning to do second round too. #66daysofdata rocks.
Thank you for doing this!  I find your videos and podcast incredibly helpful in helping me focus on learning data science.  The 66 days will be another way to reinforce the learning habit and to see what others in the community are learning.  Keep up with the outstanding content!
Guys, you must start this challenge as soon as possible because it will really worth. This is my personal experience and the community on LinkedIn is just amazing which have many people who are really helpful üôå
‚ù§Ô∏è
Let's goooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great initiative Ken, let's do this üòÜ
Ken! Just picked up Data Science and I‚Äôm super excited for the challenge! Look for me on Twitter for sure!
I dig it!
Exciting! Looking forward to see what you and the others get up to. Did you make the short using the new tools made available recently?
#66daysofdata Wait, whattt!!!! 
I will be able to finish this round and start with you again ü•≤üòÑ Could be the Kaggle round, finally!!!
Hey! This is so exciting and looking forward to joining the challenge. I am currently an Analyst at a FinTech company and have a solid Maths background but not so much in technical knowledge. I would love to get more experience in Data Science as this is actually one of my dreams but I find it really hard to find the time when you have a 9to5. What you do is really inspiring by the way, was wondering if you had any videos about your career? Do you have a full time job as well or doing youtube full time?
Just found your channel and I wanted to thank you for your great tips! Thanks and keep it up :)
PREACH HOMIE üôåüèΩ
One thing that got me interested in learning Data Science was the storytelling aspect!
do all  projects in data science need machine learning ? or just in some cases ?
Hi @Ken thanks for this video, I want to transition my career in Data engineering but don't know where to start, I'm experienced Python developer. can you please provide some reference point from where to start and prepare for data engineering role ?
Hey Ken, thank you for the awesome video as always. I have a quick question for you too. So lately I have been seeing that people have pretty split ideas on whether or not data science will be automated in the future. I am currently studying to be a data scientist, and honestly this really stresses me out. I would really like to hear how you feel about the subject. anyway thank you for your videos and ideas, they are excellent.
This is great, being curious is one of the first steps, but the meaning of why give clarity! I will never look that two datasets same again üö¢üå∏
indeed.üí™üèæüëç
that was so helpful i decided to watch it again!
Loved how you told us to watch it again and I immediately moved the seek bar to the startüòé. I'm using new datasets but  the emphasis on who really gave me an idea for what to say for my dataset on search word dataset. üôè Thank you for Saturday morning productivity ‚ù§Ô∏è
Amazing video man.
Yes amazing 
Knowing your audience and for whom we are doing something we should keep in mind and some Analysis is for us to see only and some are to present .üôå üíØ
Loving your short vidoe üëè
Very helpful !!
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Thank you for this insight! Even if it sounds simple, it‚Äôs not something that first springs to mind. Sharing information like this is what makes a community continuously grow and improve.
Interesting!  It does makes sense!
Words of an angel
Storytelling is such a VITAL skill in data science!  Loved your spin on it with the examples you gave!
Wow, it's mind-blowing how you're adding new light and value to example datasets with the stories component. Awesome tip Ken!
Everyone can report that comment regarding bitcoin it will be removed....
Great tip
Ahh truth!!
Ken, I'm not sure but is this any experiment... Every comment has a same and weird reply which is little confusingü§î
You dont have to tell me twice..Im watching it again!..thank you so much.
Very Helpful!!!
What is the topic of next video ken?
Definitely incredibly useful!
Very informative. Thanks üòä
Wow nice advice
Yep üíØ... Idea matters which leads to innovation üôå
On point üî•üéØ
Awesome advice!!
Knowing your audience is an awesome tip Ken! I watched it again a second time and it actually helped me out as I thought about my current side project!

Love these short quick tips to get my day started!
Your videos now hit differently after I started my internship .. I just realized the true importance of thinking outside of Anaconda ..Thank you Sensei :3
Yeap, I've too got good reviews from people if you present your project in a form of story!
Much lovee ken!
Hi Ken. Just in the nick of time that I've been contemplating on which datasets to use for my capstone project. Thanks for shedding some light! My takeaway from your brief is addressing gaps of information to my stakeholders what they should have known but never knew till I visualize it for them, helping them to be better informed before making decisions.
Thanks for watching everyone! Hopefully this video can help you find a breakthrough along your journey! 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY
Hey I'm 24 years old is it too late to become a data science? I'm currently enrolled in a new AI program located at a community College its going good so far but I feel so far behind in  the process.
Mario Paul sent me here
Many thanks for sharing your thoughts. Such videos are indeed helpful for freshman people like me.
Thanks Ken.  I have made it to the final round for 3 interviews and got rejected by all three.  Feeling like complete garbage.  Working on building up my portfolio so I can convert the next chance I get.
Love Cal Newport! I think a lot of what he discusses on how to work could potentially help with some of this! His book Deep Work is a great place to start, or his podcast Deep Questions. It‚Äôs helped me at times manage my learning with a full time job and a very busy family!
After completing my BSc Honours (biology) degree in January this year I started a self-study journey into data science. I went over various resources including Kens and Tinas YT channels which helped. In the past 5 months my main accomplishment was the IBM certificate in Data Science and I‚Äôm so happy to say I secured my first job as a Jnr Data Scientist starting last week!!! 

It‚Äôs possible guys, keep up the hard work!
Will a bachelor's degree in kinesiology and master's in public health be helpful in a field like data analytics? I've taken classes like bio stats. I enjoy fitness, sports performance etc. I consider myself a sports junkie. I hear in data science employers want a masters degree. But what if in another field that's not data science.
This was a much needed video. Some of your videos are really helpful in strengthening my resolve to persevere with data science. Thanks man. And thanks to Tina as well, for being a catalyst for this video.
Hey !
Can I know what is this balance board ?
Very informative üëçüèª
Thanks for your existense man,this channel has come for me like a blessing,waiting for more cool stuffs.Thank your so much.
All the motivation pills i needed before starting to work!  Thanks man you're the best and i can't say that enough. I'll watch your podcast and hopefully I'll be joining 60 days of datascience on Twitter too!
Ken, I like your videos very much! They are both informative and inspirational. You have a genuine understanding of what beginners encounter with data science. Thank you so much for dedicating your time to creating the videos!
Hey Ken! Recently many articles and news sites stated that data science is gonna extinct in the future. Is it really true? Could u share your opinion about this.
Thanks a lot for this video! I thought I was the only one having these negative feelings along my journey. This really gives me hope that I can someday be as good as you in data science. :D
hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering.
I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion.

After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python.
Since then I developed a true passion for programming.

I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these.
During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics.

I am really undecided on which career to pursue.

These are the things I like mostly:
- programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering)
- using Git and Github
- discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science)
- creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person.
- languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue)

I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely "make more sense" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day.

Thank to anyone who took the time to read, sorry for being too long :)
nice
The ‚ÄúImpostor Syndrome‚Äù usually refers to the nagging fear of being labeled a fraud for having a job we don‚Äôt feel we‚Äôre qualified for or receiving an award or recognition that we don‚Äôt feel we actually deserve.
A variation should be called the ‚ÄúAverage Person Syndrome‚Äù for the frustrating feeling of not being ‚Äúenough‚Äù. News and social media frequently show us things like grade school students developing apps or web sites to address some issue of the Covid pandemic, or podcasters, YouTubers and Twitter tech influencers with thousands of followers. This can leave ‚Äúaverage‚Äù people second guessing their ideas and projects as not being significant ‚Äúenough‚Äù when compared to others on display.
Heavily relate to feeling overwhelmed at times!

I've always felt overwhelmed when I think about how vast the field of data science is and all that there is to learn and keep up with.

What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:)

Taking small baby steps and learning through 1 project as a time has been a huge success for me & for those trying to learn, I highly recommend the "Data Science Project By Scratch" series on Ken's channel!
Thank you for the informative video üôå
This time i will try hard to stick  with my goal .Thank you sir for motivation
really nice to see im not the only one. thanks Ken
Human brain can predict well human thoughts & problems too than artificial intelligence so that u made this video for us!!!!
The best way to overcome discouragement i found is to accept failure. Accept that you are gonna fail but also have the confidence that you are gonna get through it if you work hard. Recently was given a task which I thought I could never do. Right now, i just finished the prototype for it and will be presenting it on Monday :)
Hi mate i Love Your video's so Much , i Come From a Background with me only graduate in My Community. Can I Get Your Mail? How do i contact you. I need some Career counselling. I would really appreciate it
You very nicely explained all the mental barriers and how to overcome them. Thanks for helping all of us Ken .
Great video as always Ken! For me, re-evaluating my Why helps to bring perspectives and motivation to get back up again. As you suggested, changing environments or taking a walk does really help to declog a stuck state. The realization that it‚Äôs okay not to know everything does give great comfort, great tips!
Hey ken just wanted to say I'm loving notion üíï
Ahhaha..this video is perfectly put on what I feel day to day in my job
Ken, i study Petroleum Engineering. Can i study Data Science for master degree? And what can i do to be accepted by university with high probability? I have 3 years left in my bachelor degree.
So close to 150k let‚Äôs gooo
Thank you so much for this
Absolutely, taking a break for a while while getting confusion and frustration has helped me as well. It's informative for lots of learners out there like me. Thank you so much for sharing, Ken.
My last project I decided to use sklearn and ended up with an overfitted and underfitted model. Definitely felt discouraged and realized taking a nap or tackling it after not thinking about it helped to feel more confident. Another is learning so much based on job postings. Have learned so much for Data Science and looking at SQL feels overwhelming. Thanks for this video and I'll probably watch it a few more times to help me.
Ken, I think that my therapist has helped me a lot in my journey as a Business Analyst. They have allowed me to get to the root of my problem, which is exactly what data science is about. I highly recommend pursuing EMDR with a trained therapist to tackle the core issues of one's character. This therapeutic journey has allowed me to get over myself and to just jump straight into my work problems.
Timed breaks + personal metrics + community --> Great for the mind.
I've always struggled with building up the courage to teach others (especially online) due to imposter syndrome. 

What I realised was that you don't need to know everything to teach others, you just need to be their guide. 
You're both on the same journey, but you're just sharing the things that seem obvious to you which might not be to them :)
THAT'S ME!!
Hey Ken jee
Can you make a video on top colleges for masters in data science in the world?
2:46 Ken very much resonate with this of taking the time to think and contemplate.  I do this with short bike breaks during the day and it's done wonders with helping me come up with solutions to complex problems!! Thanks for sharing your insights on this important topic!!
Wow awesome @Ken Jee! Just acknowledging that everyone has these feelings by itself makes it easier, especially coming from you! And like other comments here, sometimes switching the problem/changing the tool to solve the problem also seems to help, maybe that's a point to add
This was awesome! I've been feeling discouraged because I would do well in interviews, even receiving compliments for my growth and enthusiasm, but then I'd be rejected, only to be invited to compete again. After 6 months of this, I've got an internship! Thank you for teaching me how to stick it out and go on, Ken. God bless you!

If I could add one thing to the last part of the video; something that has helped me a lot is changing the tool you use if you're really stuck .. I got stuck so bad creating a Dashboard that gets updated daily in R Shiny and got so frustrated .. I completely switched the language and did it on streamlit, I finished it all in one day afterwards ! Just like Tina once told me that you shouldn't be married to one course, the same thing could be said for DS tools ! I think this is super important because many people spend days working on one thing until they quit completely ..
Really really really excellent video!  I needed to hear this.  I just need to concentrate on my classes and keep moving forward.  By any chance have you heard anything about the PG-AIML program at the University of Texas?
Thank you for this video. But the bird pooped at 9:34 lol.
You feel even more discouraged if you are from India. Here in India as a computer engineer or computer science student the 2 mainstream ways of getting an internship or a placement is to do Development or do Competitive Programming and get a SWE job. 
If you choose Data Science and if you manage to get a job you will be paid half the amount of a SWE as a fresher. 
It leads to doubt... Am I doing the right thing?
Great content as always. I have a question, maybe it will help others too. 

I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too:
One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^).

However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). Landing a job in a different company/industry is easy?

Your opinion is much appreciated!
Hey, Ken. I have small request for you.

Can you also pass my prize to the next winner. You already have given me many resources through this competition and those are really useful for me.

I'm really gratefulü§ó to you for your support and efforts for the community.
Great video, Ken. What I realized overtime is that you‚Äôll never be free of worry, anxiety or feelings of inadequacy. But what I‚Äôve learned to accept is that these feelings are your body and mind‚Äôs way of self-regulating to push you past your comfort zone. 

Life is a struggle, learning new fields of study is a struggle, but as long as you learn to accept the struggle and push forward regardless, when you zoom out you should get a better picture in how much you‚Äôve accomplished over a course of time. And you should be very proud about that.
Great stuff as always!
Refreshing ‚ú®
Feels less burdened nowüíØ.
These days when the notification for your video pops up and I am wasting my time, it feels so terrible (of course all because of my stupidity and procrastination). But it serves as a strong motivation for me to continue my project. But I need an independent drive and perhaps even a proper course to follow. The stuff on 365 Data Science seems good.
is your dad ever awake?  curious to see his "sleep ring" results vs yours lol
PS I love that there are always papayas hidden in your videos. It‚Äôs that same feeling of finding the pineapple in Psych.
I think importer syndrome seems to be what hits me hardest. After starting on a project it doesn‚Äôt feel so daunting, but up until I start, it feels way too out of reach.
I was feeling discouraged but I didn't gave up the idea of diving into the field. That speaks in itself  that I wanted to learn this . 
Great Video Ken!!! I needed  it.
Yes, It's is really important to control time which we are spending on using tech products. Having some physical exercise and mediation is essential. 

During these days mostly people are following WFH pattern and spending too much time on using laptops and mobile phones including me but I'm trying to set boundaries to it because it has bad impacts on our health. 

Thank you Ken for this video it is really helpful üôå
Being able to re-frame imposter syndrome into something that motivates you is game changing. Definitely not a master at it but I'm starting to get into that mindset. Also loving the podcast! Christian's journey from Photographer to Data Analyst was so amazing to listen to and highly inspiring.
You know what ken i needed this.... Ken i am so confused between using dash in python for making dashboard & using tableau for making dashboard... Can you distinguish between them... Both of them uses for visualization but which is better for quick visualization with less efforts
Hey Ken, what's better:
1. Computer science
2. Mathematics and computer science degree?
Appreciate your opinion very much
In the last two weeks we set up a model registry with mlflow which allows to write model artifacts to the hdfs. We had deploy that in our Kubernetes Cluster and make that work with the hdfs. Volumes, kerberos tickets, different nodes. I even had a feeling of quitting the job because I am too dumb to be honest. In the end, we made it. We have to love the struggle, we don¬¥t get paid well because it¬¥s easy, but because it¬¥s hard. 
Splitting it up really helps, taking a break helps. Good advice in the video :-). Pro tip: To make it really stick, teach a colleague about it or make a youtube video about it. Kinda selfish reasons for a YT channel, but in the end it¬¥s win-win ;-)
r u married
Podcasts are really helpful. Listening to people who have succeeded is really inspiring.
Right

i‚Äôm working on a NBA Player and Team-Comparison Dashboard using Python, pandas, plotly, dash, and the nba_api
Took part in your first 66 Days of Data and that led me to your discord where I got the help I needed to do some projects that landed me my first job working with sports data for the betting industry based on creating a predictive betting model for Darts. Currently starting another project in a different area which could one day form its own company.
Great video ken üëçüèª
Hi Ken, do you have any recommendations on projects related to NBA?
I am working in trying to improve the presicion of a non destructive test (Sclerometer) in concrete  structures by using other models than simple linear regression.
Men one Que. Would it be possible to create a small data science project for youtube let's say series of 5 -10 videos
Amazing üôè
I'm currently in high school and am looking into the field of data science. I am going to learn Python over the summer, but I was wondering if there was anything else I should do to give myself a head start in this career path?
You always seem to find interesting video ideasüëå
Papa Ken on the grind! 0:49
Great video as always! üôå
I love the thumbnail
I'm still a beginner but am currently trying to analyze COVID-19 notifications from Brazil's state of MInas Gerais. Guess I'll do some analysis to check this hypothesis: "are notifications made in capitals more data-rich than notifications made in peripheric cities?".

I am hosting this dataset on kaggle, here is a link (https://www.kaggle.com/victorfcastro/mg-brazil-covid19-reports-from-opendatasus). You can find more datasets from other states at a link in my data set description, we are gathering efforts in making public health data acessible.

if you're interested in working with the dataset, remember to set " encoding = 'ISO-8859-2' " in the pd.read_csv function to adequate to our latin encoding. that was a big obstacle I would have never come across if I didn't start on this project

currently struggling with making pandas function as I want it to
my first independen personal project (not briefed by course) is about demographic clustering, but it still draft because i don't know to define the name of each cluster, checkout in your discord about project sharing from my google colab
Dope Intro üòÖüî•
My  current project is working on building a Data Warehouse for a data analytics platform... I'm so lost RN... ü§£
Hoping it pays off so I can get a trip out to Hawaii enjoy some of those nice scenes you shard in this vid!
Do you recommend learning SAS for data science?
Hi. Your Content is amazing. Can you make a video on the best resources for learning the business side of a business data analyst? much love.
Great video! Personal projects are also great against impostor syndrome. 
It is easier to explain a solution to a project that stimulates your interest. It helps you focus on the value of your project rather than the algorithm used, which is secondary.
üëç
I am making a face mask detection project with pytorch CNN
I am working on record linkage of two databases - identify same record with spelling difference etc. I am now starting to exhaust my machines memory and want to start using distributed computing perhaps google colab might be the way. Initially will match manually. Next would be to apply machine learning to classify matches by training on manually matched data
Hey Ken, really appreciate the video! Is there a connection between data science and accounting? Specifically between audit or tax accounting?
by project, we really mean the final deliverable is the jupyter notebook thats uploaded to github, right?
Just Fabulous!!!
As always explained really great. I agree with you on  the fact of getting overwhelmed by sheer content to learn. I am new to this domain and I have been learning like crazy but still it feels like looking into the abyss. But yes, keep on pushing and staying positive is the best thing to do. Thank you for the quality content.

PS : Your dad gives Master Roshi vibes...
For my first project I'm presenting my own Netflix data. I'm really excited because it's personal and small enough for me to feel that I can make it into an interesting project.
you. are. the. BEST!!!! Period.
I am currently working on building a chatbot from scratch. I was always a theoretical based learning then the application. But while following your channel and implementing it to my journey I really loved the project based learning. In fact, I am exploring concepts like siamese networks, BERT, and transformers for the first time while building the chatbot.
Hi Ken, great video again. I‚Äôve been listening to KNN and I enjoy the podcast. In a future video on data science projects could you talk about the differences between using Kaggle and GitHub? If you already have I‚Äôd appreciate if you could point me to the video or episode.
This is a fantastic video, Ken!
Hello Everyone!
If you're new and looking for an online mentor, KENN is the best.  His channel is everything you need to get a data scientist perspective.  
I've learned so much from him and I feel so overwhelmed by the fact that he despite being so busy with his schedules, has done so much for the upcoming generations!
Love you ken. Just wanted to appreciate you!
I came to realise that it's important to do a project for learning and to implement some new concepts but at the same time we need to create value or purpose through it.
When I came across some technical interviews I realised that interviewer is more interested in-
My understanding and purpose of creating project...
I am working on using UC Berkley TIMs and Safetrec to map out collision accident data in my city andd present it to the mayor.  One city near me made a similar analysis and presented it to Berkely and secured a $11 million grant to improve the highways were collisions are most likely to occur.
Problem based learning is the best way of learning and retaining the knowledge you gained during the project. üí™üèª
You have been an absolute godsend for me and my career! I was feeling inadequate and had a strong case of imposter syndrome, but your channel and resources have absolutely transformed my perspective and mind. Throughout University, despite being taught the adequate math behind Statistics and Data-Science, we were never taught anything about Python or modern programming practices. With one more semester left of Uni, I finally feel confident going forward due to your work! Thank you so much Ken, love your channel and your podcast.
Ken please answer me, I'm learning data science but I don't know about how to search for a data science job and how could I get a job in our field , now a days everyone is learning data science so what would be the best reason that the hr may looking  in newly data science grads
I was just deciding what project should I do and there you are publishing a video about projects. Thanks a lot Mr. Ken for this valuable information.
Yess I keep doing volunteer for a real time projects so I can gain experience before starting a job and always write blogs or showcasing my projectsüíØüôå
Great video Ken! Totally agree with you on the importance of projects. In academia, doing projects and sharing its results is one of the major contributions we can give to the scientific community (publishing a paper, presenting at conferences, serve as use case examples when teaching a course, serve as research thesis for undergrad and grad degrees, etc.).
Sir can you give a perfect intermediate roadmap for data science pls?
Added the Project list to my watch list for June. This video is right on the time when I need it. Thanks for sharing Ken.
I have completed 4 different projects in ML and DL :) I think I will start working on kaggle competitions soon
I'm currently working on a small python project and then I'll move to a machine learning one, tysm for the vid ken, great shirt btw XD
Why is there just a random old guy sleeping at the end of the video???
Nice content
Can you please, give us projects we can practice with, real world projects
I haven't made a single project yet not even the Titanic one . I was bouncing between that project and learning what should be required üò≠üò≠üò≠
Actually what I wanted‚ù§
Sign up for Notion here: http://ntn.so/kenjeenotion ! I hope you enjoyed the video here. All the books and links are in the description above. I'm nowhere near perfect, but my data has really helped me to improve my quality of life. Let me know below how you are planning to use your data to do the same!
POST THE NOTION TEMPLATE.
I thought that was a wedding ring not a sleep tracker xD I am tracking my eating habits, meditation, sports/yoga, reading and productive work.
I am a medical student , i think your this knowledge helps me to make my life more reliable
Although I'm not a #Papayas&Ducks person (more like #Apricots&Cats person), the tips are very useful! (lol)
I'm considering starting using Notion app... I work adequately with to-do lists, but there is a lot of space for me to improve! Recently, I've been losing the pace of my lists
Very happy, that this ring is not fashion product haha. I noticed it very often and always thought that it is little bit strange to be only for fashion purpose:)
Wooow, thank you for these tips
I track callories and sport time
I track my daily habits through Notion 
such a great app üôå.
Thank you Ken Jee. This is really insightful :)
Great content as Usual üî• ! I love Notion and Cal Newport's books as well! Of course, Tracking Pappayas has to be in the Habit tracker üòÜüòÜ
I usually have a special project and blog trackers so I give myself usually a week to complete a data science or a video game and write my data science blog
I too eat whole papayas and claim they help my productivity c:
I am gonna try that for sure in future
Hi I am a Data Science student at university and love your videos. You should definitely create/release a template for notion. I use a variety of different software and platforms to capture and manage my data and am really interested in consolidating.
1:57 Poor email doggy ü•∫

2:55 I track how much money I spend building my boat, my overall video schedule, and what tasks I complete each day.
It would be great to see how you use notion! Good video :)
I had always been intrigued about data and how it impacts our life as a part of my job was a HR Professional. And during the lockdown I spent a good amount of time on reading and finding out more about Data. So much so that now I am taking up the Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. I have been tracking my daily habits, physical exercise patterns and writing schedules for almost 6 months now. And now I think I can use this data to build a personal project or projects for my Data Analytics course. Thank you for sharing your inputs about your daily habits and how you track them. I generally work with spreadsheets and Apple Calendar / Notes. Have not tried other apps as yet.
Hey ken I just stumbled on to the field of data analytics cause I hate too much coding üòÇ and came across your page and several others and this is literally calling out to me. I do have some thing I wana  ask you I‚Äôm currently taking google analytics professional certification course on coursera and they teach R instead of python. Is it absolutely necessary for me to learn python and what‚Äôs the diff between R and python? Could you give me a basic idea. Also is this google certificate worth it would it be easier landing a job with it. Sorry if I‚Äôve asked too much but you‚Äôre very responsive on here unlike others and I would like to hear your opinion.
You stop drinking coffee after 2pm? Nice job. Was it hard at first?
Ken you making learning fun!
Thanks, Ken! This is a helpful start to setting up a personal life optimization pipeline :)
You forgot to measure how much time you spend with your Papayas üçãüçãüçãüçã
Oh wow!!  I had always thought that ring was a fashion statement. 
And it looks pretty nice though.  
Even Before too I wanted to take a look at that.
But , now I know it's a real deal.
Btw great videos Ken on how to keep track of yourself. 
I always thought of doing something like that but haven't done it with Structured data on paper.
Hi Ken. Thank you for this great video and for sharing your experience. I'm tracking my data since 2012 and it has been very helpful for me. And I have many ideas of how I can use that data. So I will stay tuned of course.
This is awesome @Ken. Would love to see your notion templates for tracking your habits!
üò∂ My surprised face that Ken Jee uses dark mode for Notion ... 
Also, I just switched to Notion a few weeks ago and I LOVE IT.  It has revolutionized the way I track my daily tasks and notes. 10/10 would recommend!
hah - the main thing I track on myself is my menstrual cycle.  I took a break from it for a while when my husband got snipped, but i started up again when I started hoping my cycle would stop.  which has been 5 years already.  

When i first started tracking my cycle, though, I also tracked acne and moods - and i was taking my temp every day, as part of cycle tracking, which also helped me track illnesses.  That was actually pretty cool.  

My ob-gyn's nurse laughed at me when I brought in a chart of my cycle dates and lengths.
Hey ken, can you suggest me which linear regression project should I do for my resume/portofolio?
WILL THERE be upcoming videos on collecting, and more important extracting, time management data in Notion in order to analyze it? Dorie Clark has an interesting article in FastCompany ("I painstakingly tracked everything I did for a month. Here‚Äôs what I learned") but the "painstakingly" in the title IS an obvious hurdle. LOL It defeats the purpose when "time tracking" becomes a major task in an of itself.
Absolutely notion is really amazing. Though I don't have great template but I am keeping tracks of the books which I am reading and my college work using notion. Thank you so much for sharing, Ken. I will love to see your template in coming days!
Thanks Ken! I would love to see a notion template.
Nice video Ken! I like how you‚Äôre investigating your life‚Äôs metrics to better understand your productivity. Currently your equation is ‚ÄúTasks = f(Habits)‚Äù. What if the number of papayas eaten in a day increases? ‚Äú‚¨ÜÔ∏èTasks = f(Habits + nPapayas)‚Äù  ü§î
Woohooüôå Sponsored video... Grtü§ò

You told me Ken that you will share your Papaya üçã story üòÖ Any plans?
I am not consistent but used to track my food habits and fitness routine. I have done it very well during my graduation. Last year lockdown helped me badly to break my good habits ü§£üèÉ

But, now I'm getting back to track since last 3-4 months. #66daysofdata played huge role in improving my learning habitsüî•

You have armed us with many tricks, tools so that it's a fun process to do these things üòÅ 

Also, you are really working at ultra levelüôå I always love to being organised so that I can minimize the error and became more effective. 

Thanks for adding value to my life through your work. I will always be grateful for what I have learned from you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Reflecting on last year, quarantining and using my phone a lot, this year I've started recording start and end time I pick up and use my phone thats not related to work. Hopefully I can gather enough data by end of 2021 and go through and analyze it and maybe predict how it would be in 2022. Awesome video and valuable as always. Have a good weekend.
#66daysofdata
Ok, I have to skip all the videos that I am behind to watch this one. I'm telling you, each time I see a Papaya ... guess who comes to my mind üòÖ and the YouTube algorithm is telling me to buy an Oura ring, let me know when it's sponsoring you to buy it!
Thank you for sharing your wisdom!!
Life metrics & Deep Work -> Love both.

Questions:
1) How much time did it take for you to set up as well as how much time do you spend on Notion daily/weekly?
2) How would you compare Notion to simply dealing with the MacBook's "Notes" or any notepad, and even Google calendar?
I did it Ken, I graduated from my master's degree in stats today. Feels a bit weird to be done with school but now I'm starting a new chapter in life. While I'm starting out as a statistician at a biotech company, I hope to move into Data Science in the coming years. That said, I could get some papaya data analyzed for you so you know where to get the best papayas or the optimal growing conditions for them if you want your own supply ;)
Currently using a spreadsheet to collect data. At first it was very detailed lots of info, but now I have reduced it to just track whether I did something or not.
Very interesting material! Thank you for that! 

One thing that struggles me and I think might be the less comfortable one is that you have to introduce the the data, daily, by yourself (Notion scenario). Am i right?
Is there a manner through which you automate that? 

Thank you again!
Thumbnail looks epic
You reminded me of my first lesson in Microeconomics ! Optimizing the (leisure,work) couple .. You took this to another whole level üî• You're living in the 22nd Century Haha ! I wish you success and Happiness Ken :)
Hi Ken,   interesting topic - deep work hours are great to track and stay on focus. Noticed you mentioned you push off email reach out - I sent you one recently :)
I admire your ability to eat papayas... They're just not for me.
I can totally relate with this, I am also collecting data of my personal learning and habits which I want to change. I am using spreadsheet and Trello boards
You forgot how to analyze how many hours you spend snacking! :D
Notion template a big yes, please!
It will definitely help in getting started and at a later stage it can be modified according to one's priorities ‚ú®
Thanks for sharingü§ù
2:27 You eat papaya with the skin?
I loved this video!
So many things to learn from you. I am currently using Todoist to track my study , #66daysofdata challenge and my daily routings as well. I will try Notion as well.  I really want to get ride of my habit of checking cellphone, I don't have FB, Insta or any other social app still I check my phone often, then realize there is nothing except YT  so I watch YT shorts and lose my focus. I really liked your Hour timer in another video. I have started using Laptop countdown timer to stay focused and away from phone. I copy a lot of things from you . üòÖ
I started to record how much time I spent studying in a spreadsheet, that's help me keep on track.
Is it okay to leave out the "Pizza slices eaten today" field empty üòî ?
is that a papaya or a mango? üëÄat 2:25, also definitely going to try out Notion! tysm for recommending!
Interesting trying to find a correlation between sleep and mental health. Might have to give that a shot myself!
The Oura ring is basically a scam, it's too inaccurate. Google "dr Anthony Pearson oura ring"
That's an amazing observation Ken üíØ . I think we all should start Analysing our daily data and come out as a better version of ourselves. üôå. Can you share the #66daysofdata template and also your daily tracking table template ? Would love to use them üíØ
Notion is for sure my ho to app....the first thing I open in my PC is Notion . I manage , take notes, keep all my resources at one space and also share it üôå.
The topic itself looks so interesting ...now I am gonna go and watch the video
Mental clarity!??
Good explanation
You should do a part two xd since lambda has so many applications
maybe you could do a little more example for us? make a couple more minutes perhaps? but i like the idea about the short vids, thumbs up!!
Very cool.  I just went over lambda functions last night.
I love these shorts‚ô•Ô∏è. 
I also tried using lambda function but I get confused the very next time I want to apply it.
Fast and reliable ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Another great short. Thanks Ken!
Solid and simple explanation. Just like a lambda function.
Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for the video! I've been struggling getting into data analytics industry for the past 1 year. After watching your videos, I've tried doing projects from Kaggle, but my technical skills for completing projects on my own are quite not there to show off to hiring managers. I recently was contacted by a recruiting firm that provides SAS training and get assistance getting into a first SAS programmer role, it will take me 3 months to get a certificate and possibly get the role. I'm thinking maybe 1 year of experience as a SAS programmer can help me to get a feeling of data analytics field, and continue to learn Python on the side. Could you advise if this could be a helpful route for me?
Lambda function are Python's jam!
Other fun fact: Anonymous functions originate in the work of Alonzo Church in his invention of the lambda calculus, in which all functions are anonymous. BOOM ü§Ø
Perfectly balanced as all shorts should beüëç
I first learned about lambda functions and feature engineering from your Titanic Project tutorials months ago :) I've come so far since then thanks to u .. Btw love the music, I suggest it gets louder for like two seconds at the end.
This is so useful!!
I loveee these shortttt
papayasKenAte = 2
totalPapayas = lambda x: x - papayasKenAte
print(totalPapayas(5))
How much papayas is left üòÇüßê
Thanks, bro.
Shorts are great. We need more of these.
Short and on point üôå
Nicee, need more of this mini videos bro! Thank you do much
Yeah... I also came across lambda functions manier times while practicing some projects üôå 
Shorts are working better because it quickly helps to understand the concept ü§ò
Brilliant idea to make short vids like these. And yes I have come to rely on lambda functions more recently after watching your project on data science salary estimates. They keep the code compact and clean.
Honestly, they're black magic! #witchcraft I tell you
Cool
how to learn data science and make a transition towards data science, got no technical degree like CS or BTech. Kindly help. 
Working on MIS reporting
Hey Ken can we put kaggle project in the resume ?
For a beginner like myself, I found Kaggle really tough to understand. I quit using Kaggle because it doesn't teach from  the scratch.
Ifully agree ! 
Kaggle is awesome and free !!!!!
Who owns kaggle
Loved the fun fact :D
Hi Ken. Do you know a place to learn basketball analytics? Thanks!!
So I know now what kaggle actually is
I signed up for Kaggle last night, thanks to you.  You are the man.  Thanks Ken!
I can't live without kaggle
ü©≥
Ken I am planing to shift to Data science . My company is not having data science in my location. Could you suggest if I should kaggle datascience stream or edx Harvard prof certificate or Azure DP 100 exam? I m trying to follow #66 days data science from today. DataScience is in mind again after 2 years or probably I should look something else
Ken, you're always blowing my mind with how things are being named!!! ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Can all of your data science videos also relate to data analytics
Kaggle is a great place to learn. I love the free tutorials they create.
Hi Ken.
Can you please make a video on how to fine-tune GPT for language Modeling (i.e. for next word prediction) ?
Completely agree üôå Kaggle helped me alot through my learning of data science. It's very sorted and easy to understand...ü§ò
So, ken is getting better at shorts.
I love kaggle and frequently recommend it but i wish this video was easier to see.  The bits of you are super dark - and do people really use kaggle on a phone?
I first learnt about Kaggle when I did a course with JovianML. Just used the free GPU hours, but I will definitely get more involved with the communityüëåüèª
Yess kaggle is best place for resources but sometimes the data set way to pre made
Great #shorts video Ken! Would love to try out that algorithmic name generator, awesome! Perhaps a new Streamlit app? :)
Thanks for showing Kaggle to me, Ken! Just starting my journey and that site came handy and beautifully to me ‚ò∫Ô∏è Keep up the good work!
Thanks, Ken. Short and informative.
True Ken, No other place like Kaggle.
I got to know about Kaggle for the first time from your videos only üí´
Such a useful resource for data scientists üíØ

pandas tutorials
The panda pics were very satisfying
I have not used it yet, but I am getting there.  Maybe I will work on it tomorrow during my study time.
damn those pandas are so cuteüòç
Love that you have Josh‚Äôs merch on!!
He has a brilliant channel :)
Loved the pandas :p
Hey ken ,can you tell whether the interviewer  ask to implement (to code )any of the algorithm from scratch i?
Sir can you please help me to findout how i start my career in performance analytics or especially in cricket. Is there is requirement of any degree or i can learn from any source? At this time, i am doing btech in computer science.
Love this idea
Mini-pandamonium. üêº 
Way to "Spark" interest. ‚ú®
Nice one Ken!!
That shirt BAM!!!
Yessssss Ken!!!! 
The Pandas pictures are so fun!!! And the fun quick fact, please keep that on the next ones!!!
came to see what pandas stands for after using it a while ^^
üêºüêºüêº I had no idea this was named after "Panel Data".... I thought because dataframes were cute they wanted to name this library after a cute animal.... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
By the way, I do find pandas not only more beautiful but also, and more importantly, easier pets to live with than their numpy counterparts .... what? Pandas are not cute bamboo animals? WHAT?! It actually means PAnel  DAta ? Whhhhaaaaaaattttttttt????!! 

Oh wait ... watch the video till the end Daedalus and you would have realized that üòÖüòã
I enjoyed the extract of information I received in less than a minute. Keep up the great work!
Lol those pandas. They don't even know how much Data Scientist love them. üòâ
Thanks for breaking it down in an easy to digest way üôè
Im a data manipulating panda üí§
do a learning series on some important libraries :3 like pandas, numpy, scikitlearn :3
yeah but dplyr in R is better ;) 

Sorry I've been so absent. I am wrapping up grad school in a week and found a job as a statistician that I'll be starting in a little over a month from now!
Indeed the photos of ‚Äúpandas functions‚Äù are hilarious, gotta love em! Great #shorts video Ken!
Want more of such short 'shots'! üöÄ
Loving this üíØ
These shorts are Informative and works well for short attention span personüôåüëè
I am using Pandas very often these days... Not this one üêºüòÇ 
Data science is a zoo (Python üêç Hadoop üêò Panda  üêº ) and I'm enjoying my visit to the zooüòÇüèÉüôà
Love these shorts. So informative and easy to consume on a quick break!
Reminds me of Tropic Thunder. Lol.
Appreciate your search for panda pics relevant to the topic :3
I love the use of the panda pictures to describe the different functions of the module üí™üèª
Your data science project from scratch was really informative. Loved it. You should do more such playlists.  Thanks.

clean your lens bro
Thank you for the content!
I believe I need to apply the theory to projects more. I haven't yet worked on, let's say, real projects, except for some Kaggle practice and reading.
A few days ago, I set out to create a substantial project involving extracting valuable insights from the remote job market, and I'm finding it quite challenging to locate suitable data sources. I mean, I'm investing a lot of time exploring techniques to attempt scraping LinkedIn, for example, but it hasn't been yielding any results so far.
I would appreciate any suggestions :)
Hey one thing I missed: the right learning succession. You need to know your basics and that is calc 1-3 or in Europe mostly analysis 1 and 2. Linear algebra. And from there on stats 1 and 2. And than coding, machine learning and what not. Or regression. But the key is to know your basics. I so often encountered a problem where I missed math knowledge so, people. Learn math and Stats.
all is clear thanks but i have one doubt i completed python basics and thinking of data structures (dsa) is dsa needed or required skill for data science or not ? plz reply üê±
Hi Ken...thanks for your content. I do a lot of econometrics..learning modelling data (Logit, Ardl, VARs). I think this is a good thing but which skills do i urgently need to learn to call myself a data scientist in your view? Of course divibg deeper into programming etc?
Thanks for this video, Ken! I'm getting into the part where i am "appllying the theory" in projects and i feel like i've learned nothing at all hahaha
It's always good to hear some encouragement from others <3
It's a cruel experiment, but there was an experiment on rats in water. It showed that a rat will drown in 15 or so minutes if left unattended, but if you save the rat right as it submerges,, and put it back in the water, it'll keep swimming for another 60+ hours without drowning. It applies to your concept of us always having 100% more to give. In this case it was more than 100% more.
What's with the papaya??ü§î
Thank you for the motivation Kem. I am not the one who is good at maths and statistics . But I love to solve problems in real world . Also somewhere in my mind says data science is good career path for you . So doing it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Fantastically helpful video. Thanks for creating something so uplifting and straightforward! Really excellent reminders and motivation to keep going on my learning path.
Thank you!
Thank you Ken.
Very informative video. As a IT student myself, I don't know whether I should choose to study data science or network enginner in my next degree course. As I have no experience, idea, knowledge of data science. 
Do you think it's a great idea to move to data science career or to other IT career?

Would appreciate your thoughts on this. Thanks!
Sit thanks.......really from the bottom of  my heart thanks....
I almost cried when the video cut over to your introspection clipüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Good stuff Ken jee!
You always hear it from seasoned data scientists; just start. But where - right? My advice 1)do small projects. 2)complete a project. 3)literally, rewrite a project you find an example for on YouTube or a GitHub. Literally, type the solution out word for word. This will allow you to feel the data science flowing through your fingers. Then go back and modify the project you just built. Modify it just enough to change the results. Now you feel the data science even more. Your confidence just went through the roof. 

Like he said, learn just enough.  Cause the reality is that you‚Äôll only use 1/10th of what you learned. At least at the beginning. No one is going to make you a lead out the door. If they do, quit or turn down the job. 

Also and most important, realize a data scientist in IT is not the same data scientist in Finance. I‚Äôm a SQL SME in accounting and finance. but if I hang out with IT SQL SME‚Äôs, he‚Äôs from mars and I‚Äôm from Jupiter. We speak SQL but we use SQL for different goals. Data scientists are the same. 

Don‚Äôt get distracted. You‚Äôll find your place. Just keep DSing.
I failed my second course R  for the certification of Data Science. Your are right about giving up easily since I am a beginner. I will re-do and study harder. Thank you! Your channel helps me a lot!!
That video actually came in a good time cause I'm really burning out im my first solo project. Even though I'm not in such a bad position, made a lot of courses and I wrote my first "import pandas as pd" five weeks ago I always feel like I'm having a slower progress than I should. I'll take it easy with myself and start with smaller jobs
‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you very much.  I like your honesty.
Thanks Bro to make me so much clear and i will take care of it.
I have been working on data analytics projects for 2-3 months now and i have to agree, i am making so many mistakes and so many things are getting lost but the more i work, the more i am learning and the more im practicing and its been a great experience for me honestly. Data analyst/science is probably the most fun job out there and the most challenging one.
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This video is the best way for a well sleeping for me.
Random Q: isnt there a UI (end user stuff) for getting arranging statistics/data instead of doing the hard coding??? (Im guessing all data is in DB SQL like formats so you cant use end user style tools?).
eh every job is the same basically gets mundane or same same- unless your doing an extreme sport for job...
... ''sexy computer vision and deep learning projects '' )))) thanks dude
Agreed on knowledge of the topic as it helps you understand the data and you have an idea on what to look out for.
Thank you for the tips. I have resonated with the tip on getting involved in projects. I started working on projects recently and  there's been immense growth in my understanding of concepts.
papa jee!! i hope he had a lovely nap :)
hm, dont look for resources just dive into projects. Also, check out the 100 video playlist on my DS project . make sense guess i wont ever get out of this loop
Is keggle free?
I still consider myself a beginner after almost two years of learning. Listen to what he says. He is spot on! I would also add that if TOUS start a MOOC make sure you finish it unless the content seems to advanced for your current level
Bravo, Ken. You¬¥ve certainly figured out a lot of this right. Thanks for sharing!
Hands-on projects, especially small, focused projects, from the outset will accelerate learning of both the theoretical concepts and the practical skills. For example, learn Python while learning a data acquisition technique provides context and motivation. This approach applies to each stage of the data science workflow and to each of the technologies. Revisit earlier projects and add another stage of the workflow.
Great!
subscribed! for awesome videoss
thank you üòä just started this journey. It has been a month, and loving it already. I know it is going to be tough in upcoming days or months but I am up for it!
What's the song playing in background?
is there a age average or age gap to enter into the Data Science field?
WHO'S GONNA CARRY THE BOATS AND THE LOGS
Does 365 Data Science have project?
Thank you for this video. I'll will revisit this video again and again throughout my DS internship this Summer. I've already fell into some of these traps :O
Thank you for the video, Ken. I'm just starting to learn about this field and my interest is only increasing. My nowaday's goal is to learn to program in Python.
Probably most useful and honest videoüëç
Excellent suggestions!  All of these are very helpful.  I do think I am going to go through a project with you so I can start learning. I will let you know which one I start with and how it goes.
"Data science is a marathon and not a sprint"- Nice line ken! Keep going, very helpful video
I will make sure I don't make these mistakesü§û
Hii Ken, right now i am working in data driving company having 1.5 year experience which I have only worked on excel, does this experience will get added to data science and. Yeah is this a right time to take up the course in 365, coz I have been from long time to take up the course
I've been on my data science journey for a while now and the mistake of neglecting domain knowledge was a big one for me too. Great to see I wasn't the only one :)
It was overwhelmingly scary at the beginning, but now I think I know 'what not to do' if I am to make a path out of my passion for Data. Thank you for coming up with such videos. They are a great help.
hey ken jee, thanks for the info. i am  30 and  a total bum. so, i'd like to quit being a bum. this looks like a great career. what do you advise for someone who would like to get started even in something related and not necessarily in it, where from he/she could continue to learn while earning to then move up and /or into this field?
Wait what ? You reply to all of your YT comments ? ? Damnnnn.
Should I focus more on oop? To be a data scientist
getting to see this video at the start of my data science journey ...  this is certainly making a lot of sense now
100% agree on getting your hands dirty early with projects!

When I started, I tried various courses and MOOC's but nothing ever stuck. The moment I started attempting my own projects I started to see progress in my learning and I finally started to retain the information I was learning :)
Hey Ken just wanted to take the moment to congratulate you for how far you've come. I remember when you were a bit more underground which is just so crazy to think about. I'm super glad to have experienced your growth as your content continues to help me along my own journey, be it about data science/analytics or your philosophies. Anyways, looking forward to more awesome videos and can't wait to someday make it on your podcast!
You focus on about DS only u should say something about the person's environment about DS is also affect more than DS itself
Thank you Ken for sharing your genuine thoughts on this topic. Not gonna lie, I find myself doing some of them too
I think #3 is person dependent. If you become to reliant on a coach/mentor then your problem is your mentor not coaching you to become a more self-sustainable data scientist. I'd have killed for a bit more guidance in my formative career years rather than go and try lots of solutions. 

Maybe it's person dependent? Either way, great video. Liked and subscribed!
Thank you Ken ! The fire of obsession and stuck time are strongly correlated negatively for me, but as soon as I take a break and get my ... together I find success in the end. I used to wonder if I really love the field, but after listening to you in this video, I realized that feeling this way should be quite common. I would also add that a big mistake for DS beginners is not watching Ken and Tina's videos :) .. You guys give us all we need to stay on track
Unrelated question here!, So Im a junior physics student right now looking to become a data scientist in the future, what is the fastest route to become a data scientist ? Land a data scientist internship, get a data engineering/analyst job, software engineering job, etc? Also I live in San Diego and don't plan on moving is this going to cripple my chances to find work?
HI KEN!! Only two months ago, I started my journey by watching your video(beginner's guide) and today got my  first Internship ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for being my ultimate source of motivation!!!   Btw Happy Ramadan!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for shedding light on this amazing journey.
Why does Ken not apply for a Data Scientist job? The job would play much better, wouldn't it ?
How long did it take you to really feel comfortable applying much of the knowledge ken? As always thanks for the videos
do i have to learn deep learning after learning machine learning for data science career ?
Apologies for the unrelated comment but what is the brand-model of the chair that you're using at 4:40? Thank you and more power to you.
hey man, love your videos :). I know you are very experienced with video editing and data science (obviously), but I believe the audio mixing in your videos is not where it should be. I think you should take the time to learn basic sound and audio mixing (to make your voice more soothing etc.). A good example to learn from is the YT channel "3blue1brown", which has great audio mixing.
Good luck with it!
feeling good after watching this, thank you sir.
that 10 minute rule is smart gotta try that
Mahalo
waiting for the next 66 days Challenge üí™
Thank you Ken, this video certainly gives me direction and reminder. I love this saying so much, ‚Äú Data science isn‚Äôt a competition, it‚Äôs a long journey of slow and enjoyable progression.‚Äù It‚Äôs so true!!!
Hi Ken ! Codebasics channel brought me here. Starting from scratch. 1 month in to learning. Trying  to change career. Your channel is amazing. Thanks and please keep posting. Following your projects and works.
You forgot rule #1: You data results must reflect and support the prevailing political narrative irrespective of actual reality.
As someone who's just starting to learn and explore data science, this is really helpful. Thank you Ken!
"Give light and people will find the way" - Ella Baker. 

Txs Ken.
I hope I learned this early on my early years but I'm still 20 so I have more time to start. thanks for your video, it helped me  internalize what you said since Im always burn out before and tried so many stuffs on self dev but the truth is "I have to be honest with myself" and have my own system not copying others. I will become data scientist for next 2-3 years :)
Rip papaya you have , eat it first you must . hahaha. Nice video. I too believe self evaluation is very important before entering in any field. And the field like DS which requires lots and lots of time and learning efforts its crucial to know before you start. Thanks for making people aware of that Ken.
love ur content
Great video, ken.
I found this video very useful as a beginner to data science.
How I spend my first hour on Saturday mornings. Thanks for the continued motivation and i hope to take your support on here and use it to apply simple ML for my project. üôÇüôè
Nice! I feel better now knowing that I ONLY committed 6 out of these 7 mistakes when I first started! #winning
Mistake 2 and 4, hit me right in the feels. Definitely guilty of those when I started. Preach Professor Ken, preaaach!!
Learning data science is like an ML model ... The more you train it the better result you get... Thanks for the tips. 

At what point one can say or should consider that data science is not for them?
You are a very handsome data scientist man
Point #1 I agree 100%. I'm into sports so learnt quickly that even a bad tennis coach is better than no coach for novices! So I just googled data camp and went for it
You are a great mentor, Ken!
Thanks for sharing this content as well!

Great content as usual! Ken, we know your secret now: Your source of Data Science are Papayas 1:53 :D :D
Thanks, Ken. Great video.
I wish I saw this at the beginning of my data science journey - could have saved me a lot of headaches and time! Awesome video Ken!!
Hi Ken Thanx. me a hard core biologist- of late translational research- fascinated by data science n m encouraged by ur video. look forwrd to train myself. send ya happy thots frm Himalayan foothills India. Stay blessed. üå∏üôèüå∏
I‚Äôm a subscriber from South Korea. Your videos always help me to make my decisions when I have complicate thoughts. Thanks for your videos, and I‚Äôll keep enjoying your channel!üëç
best hair in the game.
üíü
1:53 Wow USB-powered Papayas? Great insights Ken! Yes totally agree with you on the importance of domain knowledge which also helps to differentiate us from others.
Hey ken please make a video on interview for data science....like what kind of python coding question will be asked, etc...
Thanks for sharing Ken üëç
So, I am not making most of the beginner mistakes.  
But I have one question Ken. I don't know enough. Should i see the projects on YouTube and try to implement them by copying and understanding them? And you told about plagiarism in DS.  Will it be like I plagiarized those projects ??
I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). 

As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. 

Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it... 

Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. 

Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress.

Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists. 

Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...) 

So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)
The most refreshing thing about your videos is the honesty.  Almost as much as the advise. 

That and seeing your dad make Cameos ü§£
Yeah, The community helped me to create the learning habit. Thank you so much, Ken.
Great video as always, Ken! & definitely the right choice :D @1:28
Hey Ken, have you ever thought on making a video on what is important when you are in a data science role already. Would be quite interesting for me to hear your opinion. I sometimes do not know if I should dive VERY deep into some specific topics or just use my freetime to learn something somewhat related. For example I love working with REST Apis and even some Vue Frontend stuff which will not make me a better data scientist, but are also fun... Since I am also a content creator I something think the same way about creating videos. What¬¥s your opinion?
Is a masters needed because I am very tired of school?üòÇ
Mistake nr 8 : data leakage between your training and testing sets. I saw that being made by an experienced data scientist in my first job. It was ignored and a 85% precision/recall score was announced to management.
Hi! I like watching your videos. Love and support from India ‚ô•Ô∏è There's some thing in particular that I'd like to ask. 
1) It's been some time since I completed MySQL course. However i have gone through the videos a few times but still I am not able to gain the confidence of saying that I know SQL.  What do you suggest here? 
2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course? 

Course I took: 365 Data Science.
Excellent Insights! I totally agree with the point of not applying your knowledge and focusing only on theory as being one of the biggest hurdle for someone new in the field.
Those are spot on .
These are few of the mistake I made when I was starting
Mistake I personally made,  I didn't learn enough math. And I thought that I could brute force my way through a data science course with some hodgepodge math. I think really getting that foundation is pretty important and it can be done in a singular course, it doesn't have to be a year of university math classes
GOGGINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GOGGINS IS THE MAN!!
great direction
Love your videos!! As I‚Äôm about to graduate with my Masters in a few months, they give me a confidence boost

Sends out Cold Email
     >Gets Blacklisted For Life
Hi there! I recalled you mentioning that you could become a data scientist in 6 months if you put your head to it. Does this include a certified degree which will allow you to be applicable for a job which a 3/4 year degree student would be applicable for?
Sir,please provide your advise on this:
 i'm a student aspiring to become a data scientist.But i only know python as much as till looping and conditional statements.I also know the basics of pandas like reading dataframes and assigning that to a variable.But another youtuber said that if we need to become a data scientist,we must start working on data science projects ASAP and that we must learn whatever skills we require for that project along the way.But i saw a kaggler's end to end project solution and nearly recieved a stroke as everything looked like Greek and Latin.Pls help as i dont know where to begin for solving data science projects.
(i)Please suggest the appraoch that i shd take towards solving data science projects as i still dont know a lot of the programming required though im eager to learn
(ii)Also,how can i increase my knowledge quickly in tensorflow,seaborn etc that are required to begin doing projects
Hey Ken,

What are the coding workshops (applications/softwares) you would recommend for someone with no technological background whatsoever who wants to pursue sports analytics.
133k subs lets go
I swear if someone with only a google cert gets a job before me
Focus on income, not outcome. Got it. Thanks!
I had probably missed this channel for months. Hooked to learning some other staffs outside Data Analytics. But...It's nice to be back, haha.
hi sir. Is it possible to get a freelance data science job even tough I only have a bootcamp and no experience at all. I'm planning to shift to data science career but as of now I can't risk to resign on my current job so I'm planning to have a frealance/work from home job before becoming fulltime on DS. Any suggestions on how to get a freelance job or On the Job Training? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!
Always interesting to see numbers and get a better understanding of the magnitude of differences. In hindsight, it makes sense but the cold emailing thing was a surprise to me. Thanks for sharing this, Ken.
I am working as a mobile developer and i am really thinking about shifting to data science field, may you advice me if it's good choice to make + is it going to affect the salary !?
Hey Ken :) Thank you for all the amazing content. I've been binging this past week, since finding your channel.

I have some constructive criticism. I've noticed that the mixing is frequently "off" when you're interviewing someone. Your volume is typically leveled higher than the guest's, which makes it difficult to consume, without having the volume dial at the ready, to live mix.

Regardless, I appreciate you and the work you've done for this community!
I enjoy LinkedIn. I now need to keep "Cold Emailer" in my job search skill set. ‚ùÑüìß

I did initially try the "Spray and Pray" method (failed w/ lots of applications). So, the other two is definitely the "Go-To."
I finished interview for a computer vision engineer.  It's been 7 days and I'm just waiting for an email or call telling me if I got it or not.

Previously  I spoke to a recruiter at Facebook and AWS They never got back to me. It can be discouraging to apply and just get ghosted.
Do you think that MS graduates from ‚Äútop schools‚Äù (and who‚Äôve done well academically and with projects, etc) have a better shot at getting interviews through their schools and through their alumni networks?
Thanks Ken!
I've been hunting for ds internships for several months now and this is relly helpful!
Super useful information for people applying right now! Maybe that‚Äôs why I had to apply to over a thousand jobs to actually get an offer lol
Interesting data :)
I love to use cold emails/messages to network.  When i first started doing this it was so weird.  What I found was offering some type of value to the person was best to gain traction and also have a better feeling myself knowing that I wasn't just using this new person as a resource only.  New relationships can be mutually benefiical for both parties and it shouldn't just be one-way!  Great content as always Ken!
Really helpful üôå
This is really very eye opening! üëÄ Thanks for doing this video!
what's your beef with @alextheanalyst
when will it stop
or is this a PR stunt??
If I understood the article correctly this is only for US and Canada. As a European I think the data may differ drastically due to the job market culture. In my opinion here Universities are the most popular and even maybe the only way to get into the field if you want companies to look at you seriously. It's just my opinion, bit I am pointing this out for your international viewers just in case.
I've been watching you since last year, and the production quality has improved drastically! I'm happy to see this channel grow :D
I think if you want to go the cold-call email route, a nice python automation script might cut down a lot of time.  You should be able to scrape a lot of companies' email addresses and then send out emails to them with your CV. This can be repeated or done once-off? Or would it be better to cater each email to the comany that you send it to?
From opinion likedin would be better option because normal job application goes through resume software which get rejected mostly so  networking with people on LinkedIn engaging and making connections and talking to potential recruiter will be best choice but bad side of cold email  is  getting those mail people sometimes spam those which is totally not cool ....these are my opinion of course other people can have there own as wellüôåüíØ
So insightful üôè
Wow... Right video at right time üòÉ
This will help me while apply for data science jobsü§û

Great article Jeremie Harrisüôå Thanks...
Well this is eye opening. 

I guess I need to take a deep breath,  put on my big boy pants, push anxiety aside and start cold e-mailing
Your videos are always insightful and helpful :)
Dear sir, can u please tell the syllabus learn data science and free resources?
If any job
Thanks for watching everyone! It is an uphill battle, but I still believe that it is possible to make it as a new entrant into this profession!

Very disappointed
The thing is many countries like USA and Australia, don‚Äôt have protected titles for ex. Everyone calls themselves software engineer for just doing ‚Äú web development ‚Äú work‚Äù. Which is absolutely BS. Same with data scientist, many of them are actually data analyst but call themselves data scientists they are two completely different things.
Thanks for the tips. I am interested in data analysis for public health care. I am a public health physician currently working in the field of HIV/AIDS. I would be delighted to get ideas on how to start a career in data analysis. I am presently learning excel but don't know the areas to focus on.  I also need to join online communities of public health data analysts.
I agree. I just graduated with a BS in Data Analytics- I came from the background of zero programming knowledge. The beginning part of understanding the concept, syntax of these programs were extremely difficult and questioned myself a few times. But through many hours of study and self motivation, I began getting a comfortable understanding to the logic and usage of these different tools. I now feel confident using and explaining data science, and now thinking of pursuing my graduate degree in DS. I want to tell anyone reading this. Keep pushing and pushing, you to can learn data analytics, but like  ken said, you have to have the grit and willingness to push through adversity and ambiguity. 

I hope I am able to land a job soon as a data analyst. Good luck to all!
Am I the only one who didn't know it was the sexiest job I was just curious
Life is difficult these new trend videos are dumb
I was gonna dislike this and leave but then I saw that clip of you crying and liked and subscribe... IDK what's wrong with me but I'm a fan now lol
0:40-Education Barrier
2:16-
I was getting my Azure Certifications and ran across the data related certifications. It just sort of made sense and next thing I knew I was taking a Data Science class with Johns Hopkins and tearing through it. I had already taken a class on RStudio so a good bit of it transferred over nicely. Data Science and Data Analyst were both fascinating fields.
I think cleaning data is the fun part‚Ä¶ lol.
False I just landed a data scientist job in the biotech industry
Best mentor award: Ken Jee.
Been watching hours of your material (and Tina) because while I do know that it is not an easy field, I‚Äôve been fascinated by it ever since I first found out about it. Data Analysis is my passion and the one thing I feel I came to the world for, and this role I feel like it‚Äôs the pinnacle of it. I will not give up.
Sir thank you so much for sharing knowledge and awareness üòÅ
But I AM NOT GONNA QUIT 
Even if it's difficult I will make it
I got a data scientist job right out of college. To be far I graduated with a computer science degree with a minior in mathematics.
Cannot find the discord channel as i've heard in 2 different videos about it kindly share it.
This video is old but Ill put my two cents, I have almost 3 years experience as a Data Scientist and even now my resume can match up perfectly to a job I know all the skills except maybe 2 or 3 because I've never done it before in my experience and I still get denied ALOT
Link to the discord?
You just jealous we be taking your job. Just say it as it is. üòè
I am 35 years old am I too late then?
‚ÄúIt takes years‚Ä¶‚Äù no $h!t Sherlock. How many years? Dudes just do videos to act cute.
Why you talk about only negative things please upload positive side of data sceientist
When did you find out you really like data science? I assume you took some general CS classes and they teach you about technicality of what you do as a data scientist? But correct me if I am wrong. I want to know if I would like data science or not but I am not sure how I can do that. I would really appreciate it a lot if you could help me.
I‚Äôm a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so that‚Äôs data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. It‚Äôs all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, don‚Äôt go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But that‚Äôs boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but it‚Äôs the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say. 

So this sums it up. Good luck üëçüèª
Hi Ken, is data science suitable for introverts?
Thanks Ken! 
I'm a college student in my freshman year and wanted to be a data scientist too. 
Everyday I spend hours of learning code and math. Like what you've told us, it really consuming my energy and time at the point where I don't spend a lot of time with people around me. Kinda hard to find balance but I really enjoy what I'm doing and preparation for coming years. 
It also hard to find balance between data science or my college, before I came into this, I was straight A students but this semester I'm not sure because I spend too much time for learn data science. 
Btw thanks for the insights!
Thank you so much for your content, it is super helpful! Would you say the educational barrier in this field is something that matters long-term? I completed an MA program in Social Sciences and I am continuing to improve my technical skills but I'm scared of not being taken seriously because I don't have a STEM degree.
I suppose the first challenge is the most obvious especially in a bank I work for. All dudes are at least holders of Masters in Maths or CS etc. In my current position I work within members of this team and they're all very good in DS.
Yes. I shall
Yes, I whole heartily agree with you that education is a important requirement. I would be careful in  putting "Barrier to Entry" and "Education" in the same sentence. A lack of education is a barrier to achieve one's potential. Also you need to apply what you learn and not let it perish or atrophy over time. I have copied code that I didn't fully understand and got it work. I believe that there are amatuer data scientists out there that one day could turn professional.
Can you make a video on what college courses I should take in order to get into data science
Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for sharing so much great info from a personal perspective. I just subscribed to your newsletter but can't leave a comment below a video. Why? Set that way, problem my end, or problem with set-up. So, for your video, A Quick Data Science Project Tip #shorts, I will comment here. Rather than try to make the Iris data set interesting with a good story (same for the Titanic one), why not just choose a more interesting dataset? Kaggle has ones on wine, California wildfires, Covid vaccines, the covid-19 virus, Olympic medals, and so many more. My tip is to take the time to find a compelling dataset for your class assignments / projects. It's better than trying to make up a great use for that boring  iris file. (I did look up "sepal" though and learned a lot from class examples.)

I thought there was a huge demand for Data Scientists.
I was interested in this field as an entrepreneur, either way guaranteed income... but my real passion is aquaculture 
bio-engineering thus in itself is a multi disciplinary beast, interesting info
Today I asked my professor why he's doing PhD in S. E rather then Ds and he said ds is a technique not a field but due to its popularity its a field now and its a very small part of S.E and mostly apply rules of S. E
I'm still trying to find my own path, do you think data science is a good option or should I opt for something else?
Man, you really have a big fixation with papayas. Hahaha! Papaya Scientist.
Clearly, I am not acquiring these skills to become a data scientist; I just enjoy knowing about these topics. Plus, I have some projects to boast during dinner chats.
Im not gonna study data science to become something else but I appreciate the reality check you are giving here
Hi, thank you for this great advice! I really wanted to become a data scientist but now I've been considering that choice for a while.. Is it possible for me to take a master degree in data science after a bachelor degree in actuarial science?
what is the best degree to be a data scientist
My majoring in Data Science watching the introüëÅüëÑüëÅ
I will be graduating in December (Ph.D. Chemistry). I am interested in getting into Data Science. Have you got any good starting point and tips for me? I got a bit worried watching your video there üòÖ
I got my first data science job, and I start on 8-6-2021!
Interestingly, the field is shifting away from ‚Äúgrab any bloke who can spell data science‚Äù to one where domain expertise for specific industries will get you farther up the chain. You DON‚ÄôT need to be at FAANG to be successful in the field.
From looking at your video and at the Data Scientist guy at my company, I realise the most important part of becoming a Data Scientist is the hair do.
DevOps Engineer vs Data Scientist 

Salary, jobs, difficulty, time constraint?
I'm 30 Years old, what is your honest opinion me to become an Data scientist.?

I was thinking to give my self full 4 years to study and learn everything there is, plus as many Projects as i can gather along the way by implementing everything i learn in to participating in the projects.

I'm very much obsessed with A.I sci-fi, and i have one big startup project that i would love to build my self as an side project along the way while I'm studying too.

I have 11 years of experience in marketing, business management, had an marketing agency once did pretty good.

Could you enlighten me on this subject, would 4 years be enough to  get a job afterwards.

Currently i have all the time in the world to study.

Thank you so much.

Have a nice day. ü§úü§õüç∫
Why am I watching this and what the fook is data science xD
Just started my first full time job with the title as data scientist. Your sharing helps a lot!
I honestly came here because I just started learning about data science and was considering it as a career opportunity, and this video was great for helping me not only feel informed on how much education is needed but also that the market is SATURATED. I'm leaving a saturated job market, so that's really important to me! Thank you!!!
to answer your last question in this video: YES
The contents in the video is great but unfortunately the title of it is aimless and frustrating. You know that if anyone who just decide to become a data scientist and in the beginning of their way and see the title of it then enter like i did, you made the subject very difficult on them like " what all of these challenges i will take.. it is a long way ... No no I can't continue i am gonna give up" just because this video??? Why don't you encourage all people to work in this field encourage, motivate them?? , but in fact it is not difficult, it just needs to work hard... 
You're already making videos related to data science, but why would you put someone down when they've found a dream and want make it comes true?? And also make him worry that he might back off and you prove that belief in his head? Also at the beginning of the video you talk about this as if it is impossible for normal people to do
Sorry, but your introduction to the challenges that will face any student or a normal person who has decided to major in data science will lead him to desperation from the beginning of the video
Hi! Would you mind sharing how you got into data science? As in what was your path to this career and what you suggest for someone still deciding where to go to college.
Another Tech Lead wannabe slapping clickbait titles on videos which are just rambling about common sense issues.  Just a reminder that you shouldn‚Äôt listen to You-tubers for career advice
do all these points apply to Machine learning as well ?
Just landed my very first job as a junior data scientist yest watching dis vid in my feed xD
why am I watching this, I'm an English major lmao
Signed my Data Science position in Sweden today :)
I‚Äôm watching this after landing a Data Scientist Position at my company! :)
Hey Ken! Just stumbled across your channel and totally agree with this video - I‚Äôm a data scientist across the world in australia and I‚Äôve also just uploaded a day in the life video! would love for you to check out ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I would highly suggest a masters to get your foot in the door. You‚Äôll almost be guaranteed to get a job after you graduate
As a software engineer, you are correct
I don't wanna become a data scientist....I don't even have anything major common with that field

But this video still made me reconsider my options....it good that I remembered I ain't a data scientist before applying for a ...
This video was convincing üëçüòÅ
In a nutshell, DS is hard to learn and put in practice because it requires a lot of passion to learn a lot of topics from different fields, and obviously there's is not a roadmap to learn all these skills.
Imagine that you are living as an architect in the earlies of the industrial revolution, then suddenly there's a boom for mechanical engineering with not structure at all to learn all the stuff. You'll have to learn by yourself physics, math, thermodynamics, etc. This is how DS is, is a new field and a lot of information to drive someone crazy.
Ignore the haters!
Wow, thanks for the video, and I'm just switching over my career now and  I'm really concerned, I feel old because I just a starter programmer and trying to learn data science from zero. And now I just don't know what to say, I guess I don't have any possible way to not continued to pursue this career. There is something amazing and special about this. Something from the core from the foundation that I want to learn, to know, and master.  The problem is that none of us are immortals. But I  will continue to persist, thanks again for sharing...
Is becoming a data scientist worth it?
Might consider learning UX no code writing 
Front-end and back-end was just too brutal
Honestly i don‚Äôt know what you are on about... Having worked as a Data Scientist for our government and for the 2nd largest bank of my country (Rabobank) i can say with confidence that a ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù is just a data analist with some data engineering and statistics experience... Mabey not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but far from impossible.

Second point i like to point out is that you should not want to work as a data scientist the rest of your life. You get paid significantly less for your work than for example working as a financial analist or data consultant/manager.. 

Your career path if you want to not get scammed (at least in my country) should be something along the line of: 
- BSc Business Informatics or Information Science
- Work 1-2 year as an IT consultant or Data Engineer
- MSc in Data Science, Econometrics or Statistics/Mathematics
- Work 1 year as a Data scientist at a decent company
- Switch jobs and work as a Financial Analist, Data Manager or IT manager. 

You get paid significantly more for basically less work.. my salary went from 3400‚Ç¨ to about 5200‚Ç¨ in 1 year. Worth it people...
Very insightful and sad reality 
Passion is needed to shine in any field
I love to learn and my friends say I have a thirst for knowledge. Some odd reason lol I kinda like the data cleaning aspect. Honestly I want to learn data science to align with my life purpose
Reason 1: I don't want to
I will thank you once I get job in Data science.
"You will never become a data scientist" .... but .... I am one.
Great video. I've been following this channel it's been a while. I'm at a tough crossroad now. 
My current field is Industrial Engineering (machinery maintenance). I want to switch to Data Science so I can make use of my academic knowledge to the full (Maths and Programming), also because I think DS is more Future Proof. I couldn't reach a firm decision yet, still hesitant. 

People who made a career shift to DS, what are your thought on this?
This is very true.  I have gotten acceptance on this, as I am at the beginning of my journey.  Plus, I am convinced that this is going to pay off with a Fantasy Football championship.  YES!!!!   TOTAL FANTASY FOOTBALL DOMINATION!!!!   BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!?!
4:24 broken
For sure at least we,ll be analyst..
Let us decide what we can and cannot. OK?
I appreciate the resources. Very helpful. Just wondering if there‚Äôs any discount for upgrading ‚Äúinterview query‚Äù? Thanks üëç
Good first step Data Analyst and work up from there. Just saying
Recently finished listening to the audio book of Grit - strongly recommend this book for anyone also curious about cases demonstrating principles you can apply to measure/hone/learn about achievement via a quantitative social sciences lens.
I find it so interesting how just 4-5 years ago, all you heard was how this career was booming, when in reality its overly saturated, especially with people who have years of experience over a recent college graduate. Saying that, I say keep striving for it if you want it. Just dont think its a freebe. Grind out and good luck out there!
I'm already a FS Data Scientist... and I didn't know it. 
Due predominantly to having to DIY everything solo. End to End...  I made the jump without even realizing I had.

Sometimes even a Donkey is just a Unicorn doing cosplay. Blood, Sweat, Tears, Passion, and if you don't have  bilateral carpal tunnel, you're not a FS Data Scientist.
I‚Äôm  learning data science and I will be the successful one üíôüíô
Applied Computational mathematics major here hopefully it will be easier üôè
Can I get your inputs on the online data science master degree from eastern university.
and then after you became a data scientist, you will realize that after all, its just a statistics with extra software engineering skills. Too many people get stucked in a cool complex algorithm trap while the most important thing in becoming a data scientist (unless you work in a really specific field like NLP & Computer Vision), is to have a solid statistics base
is this the same as a data analyst, if not would you say they have the same or similar barrier to entry?
You're right. I might become an AI/ML engineer.
Data Science is advertised as statistics combined with big data.
This is completely FALSE.
Additional information technology training seperates a data scientist from a regular statistician.
What does this mean?
A statistician or a data analyst has skills that can be broadly applied - every company needs them.
However, a data scientist sometimes needs to work years in a company before contributing anything.
That 3/4+ years of experience hit me really hard! 
Trust me I didn't started for Data Science just because because of high salaries or because it "sexiest job in world"......Naaaaah.  I started because I like the methodology and the science behind it ( I love mathematics and statistics and a part of CS). 
AM I GOING TO QUIT? HELL NAAAH!!
I‚Äôm pursuing my masters in data science and analytics this fall, focused on human centered design.
True indeed, I have worked as a data scientist for 2 years shifted my focus from data engineering to data science and after 2.5 years took a complete U-TURN and currently settled with ML/Data engineer. One thing I enjoyed working with DS is to get a complete understanding of maths behind numerical computing library such as TensorFlow, which was quite rewarding for me. 

Although during the journey, I realized that I always want to be an engineer and moreover there is more opportunity as an Engineer rather than being a data scientist.
Currently a data scientist at a faang company, everything he said was so true, I studied and clawed my way for 5 solid years to get my current role. However it never ends I will be starting my PhD soon just to keep up... be an SDE if you want money and work life balance
OMG... It's getting tougher for me this month üò¨üòÅ

Just One comment by @ForrestKnight and it's a nightmare for me üòÇüòÇ got downwards graph for April monthüò¨üòÇ
I'm in so big of a dilemma. Problem 3 states that software engineering might be a better fit then I'll see youtubers regretting their majors the instant I search. Just give me the janitor job at google.
how long time to become data scientist?
I thought it was pretty easy to get my data scientist job out of college??? This video seems unnecessarily harsh
Hey, I have a finance and accounting background, if I learn python,R and different languages and technical things related to data science, with relevant solo and open source projects, with relevant internships, can I get a good job in the field?
Thank you, couldn't put my experience in better words
I cannot agree enough about the point he makes where people don't understand the job. So many people want to skip over the data cleansing portion and get straight to modeling. These people tend to lack the CS skills required for data cleaning too. Data cleansing is the majority of the job and it's disappointing to see the lack of skills in this area among my peers.
Probably right to be honest, got very close to a Jr. data scientist position, lost in the final round‚ÄîIm in the process of pivoting to data engineering instead
Thanks for the video Ken. I've just started studying a data science certificate and am absolutely struggling. I'm just say "grit and determination" to myself over and over!
hey can i get the discord server link please
I am bad at math, can i still start learning?
Being in software engineering for 30 years, having built tooling to do data cleaning , ingest, data management  etc there is wide breath and depth one needs to have in their tool box dependent on the size of the company your apply too, which many don‚Äôt grasp, it not all just stats and charts
I just created Resume and currently preparing for Interview. And I don't have any degree. I don't have anything that is good related to Education to put on Resume. Everything relevant for Data Science I Learnt by myself. In few days I'll start applying. Don't know what will happen Since I don't have a degree
Bro I will do college or ibm and other micro cousres 
Or if do college which course I will do please please please please please please reply bro!!!!!!
The problem with this vid, it doesn't say what type of skills needed.
Help!!
So I just completed by bachelor in statistics and we do not have masters programme in statistics in our place! I cannot leave my home for further study. What is the best subject I can choose for masters in order to become a DS ? And  yes I cannot study computer science!
Do you actually have data showing that most people who apply to data science eventually choose another career? Or is this more a prospective warning to the swell of new applicants?
Pok√©mon is a great data-set. this guy
Truth = Truth, if one is willing to accept it. FYI Ken you just kicked many people in the *****.
I know it'll be really hard, I know that there are a lot of obstacles, but I'll try my best and become better every single day to reach my goal. :)
Hey, 
Can you suggest me  what should I do to become an well trained in field of data science ?
I don't have any coding background. 
I watched lots of video related to  #Roadmaps about learning ML,DL, AI, or  any programming language. 
I started watching video of @Krishna naik and  @Tina Huang .  
what should I do first ? 
Currently I'm started learning python, along with this I need to improve my coding skills.  

As a beginner, how I improve my coding skills?
which specific Part I need to focus?
What should I do to stay motivated while studying ? 
Because I'm switching  my career from a manufacturing sector to IT sector. 



please suggest me a proper ways to achieve target in optimal time.
4:35 funny thing... that's the solution
Hey what is the complete process of becoming the data scientist
Is it unwise for someone who studied electrical engineering to master in data science?
"Great data sex"
Wow, I finally know the words to describe the fun week I've spent cleaning and fixing the data for one of the projects at job xD
I appreciate the thoughts ken as  its 100% truth of the current market situation and no sugar coating.
Hey Mate is it worth to study a One Year Data science master in Uk.
Well I'm paying 60k for a masters degree in it so I hope I'm not screwed.
Passion is definitely what pushed me through! Don't think there's anyway around that, if you don't have it you will burn out
I know it is not easy to break into this field but I won't easily give up. I hope I can become a data scientist.
this just motivated me more.
Discipline is like the holy rail.
Quick fact: Frankenstein is the scientist who created the monster.
Is this possible to become a data scientist as a business student?
Done Voting for you !!! üôåüôå
Brutally Honest video. Brutal but Honest. Thanks Ken for showing the reality . However I will still follow this path. When I started this journey I promised myself that I will do whatever it takes.
Hi, great video! Tell me something: I have a laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 GPU. I am trying to build things that need CUDA. Is there any way to run it on a AMD GPU? Or it there any alternative that doesn't include buying a new laptop? Thanks
Ken, are you planning to upload any youtube short videos about data science?
I got lucky and in early since I studied stats like 15 years ago and did lots of programming projects on the side. Just sort of feel into it... These days I wouldn't aim for being a ds but instead data engineering or BI / analyst stuff. Go in through the back door
What's the general consensus around tattoos in the data science area?
I have been working a full time job and doing a data science diploma simultaneously but its really difficult. I still get stunned by the huge potential analysis have on every industry but being a biologist by my degree and clinical researcher by my job, coding sometimes really feels like an impossible task.
I fear I might not be able to succeed in this huge jump from one industry to another but I am hopeful.

1. How do I learn the syntax? I understand the logic but whenever I try doing something, I am unable to recall the correct syntax.
2. How do I overcome the fear of losing this epic jump? I love data and I am trying my level best to work on it but sometimes I just feel very low and don't feel like continuing because of my hectic schedule.
Would love to see a series of tackling struggles like,  what method to use and starting processes. Great work!
Yo I'm a CSE student and just got a job as a back end software engineer. Fuck this guy. Whatever your dreams are you can achieve them.
Great video mate. I am currently completing a MSc in Data science (4 courses done). While I am loving the learning process and fascinated by the field, I have no current plans to have a career in Data science. I get way too caught up when working on a project (especially when debugging code) that other aspects of my life and frankly sanity, suffer. So I can't imagine doing that for a living, as I will never disconnect enough from work.
‚ÄúData Science is the Frankentein of Computer Science with Statistics and Business knowledge‚Äù-How a quote can be funny and meaningful at the same time..haha
It's been a tough journey for me till date.. Learnt a lot but still lot to learn.. DS is not a easy field to pursue..
That corny wink about the email was awesome. Love the video Ken. Now I can go back to making snarky comments about it on LinkedIn...
Appreciate this Ken, I watched this to really test my mettle before embarking on my masters in data science and AI because it was on my recommended list. Safe to say I paid attention to the points you made but I didn‚Äôt feel disheartened at any point! Thanks for this video and pointing out the challenges faced, I think it‚Äôs very important to be aware of these challenges beforehand.
Hi Ken Jee
I want to ask, what do you think of CS50 Introduction to programming offered by Harvard? I am an absolute beginner, started learning python few days ago. The course offers other additional programming languages like Java, C, SQL etc. So shall I go for it? Or will there be extra unnecessary knowledge that has nothing to do with data science?
I have no experience in anything. Graduated with a 2.5 in college. Just go admitted to grad school in data science! You could do it too!
Well, if the jobs are hard to find I might as well do a phd while I have that time I guess
My personal advice is to start as a Data Analyst (or Business Analyst), study on your free time and kick ass on your job. If you're open to your boss and he/she likes you, it will be much easier to make an internal transition to ds inside the company you already work for. It's not still not easy tho.. good luck!
So I‚Äôm studying management data analysis, would that be in data science role or data analytic?
Watching this was such a relief. After all this time I thot it was just me still confused. Being in a Data engineering role for 5 years role still figuring out data science before plunging. 

Try try till you succeedü§û
- your new subscriber.üôè
I am still at uni (bs comp sci) making a career pivot, and I must say I was hesitant to watch this video (scared the title would be true)‚Ä¶

Anyway, I watched it. Loved it. 

I still love data, and learning (even though the uni mountain seems HUGE sometimes) and you didn‚Äôt scare me off. 

I will get there. 

Keep up the good work, love the videos and the newsletter!! Oh, that blooper was gold ü§£
7:42 Ohhh my... I was dying laughing at this one üòÇüòÇ.  Unfortunately, because I can totally relate üò´. 
Loved this vid Ken, great perspective as usual!!
Just a couple of comments on this excellent video:

For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too!

As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again):

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really. 

It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really. 

There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple:

work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form. 

PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!!  (I've been there on both front!) 
But, as they say, your mileage may vary!! 

Safe journey and good luck everyone :o)
Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was "To Kill a Mockingbird" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, "Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?" My response was, "Uh... I'm willing to work," and he said, "*sigh* Everyone's willing to work." I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases. I'm glad that having developed a sense of grit throughout the years has been so far useful for not only proving people wrong, but also giving me great opportunities.
I will become a data scientist for sure!! With one course on Udemy I figured out to clear up my basics and going on continued with the journey for the basics. Will learn it at any cost !! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey, It is good to know the challenges you will face in achieving a particular thing. Thanks for that...  66daysofdata data helping me to nurture the good habit of data science learning. I will try my best to achieve my goal...
Thank you for this video Ken Jee
"Continued learning" and "Grit". I need to continue learning about how to have the "Continued learning" skill set.
LOL'ed at the goofy giggle to  "data-sex" at the end.
The blooper at the end is the quality content I subscribed for.
Great advice, Ken. As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are "trending") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. 

I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).  This is what I'm dedicating my time to now.
That wink was so cute. I started reading GRIT a week ago, it‚Äôs a good book.
Thanks for being sincere about this kind of journey. Lets make our best effort and never give up. Greetings from Argentina!
Data Scientist... Becoming! üîã
Great video Ken!
I feel you, I cried two days ago trying to fit data into SVM and Adaboost.
The first worked, but the second still doesn't. Gotta keep on grinding, eh?!
Ken between Data Science and Data Analytics wich one is more compatible with getting a remote job from another country? Keep it up man
How can you fare as a freelance data scientist or a machine learning engineer?
hey Ken, greetings of the day...I was wondering if you can make a video about creating a data science startup...thanks in advance
The odds are surely stacked against me being 46 years of age and only having worked jobs that pay minimum wage or $1 above minimum wage at most, and no related job experience. Yet, I still refuse to give up on the good life even if it means settling to be a data analyst or some other computer science job like software engineering, data engineering, DBA, etc. If I want the good life, quitting is not an option.
We demand a bloopers only video üëÄ
I think #3 is by far the most important. It's pretty easy to get sucked in because everybody else is. Maybe this is not for you though and that's okay! You're not a failure for realizing that and going after something else.
I think consistency is the most important thing I learned this year, with channels such as yours and with challenges such as #66daysofdata and #100DaysOfCode. Specially since my college classes are not tech related, since I study political science, but I want to incorporate data science tools into political analysis, so having a schedule of 1h of learning and coding everyday is helping so much! I might not become a data scientist per se, but I really believe that with consistency and perseverance I will be able to learn the skills by the end of the year! üòÅ
Don‚Äôt sugarcoat things, Ken. Just tell me I‚Äôm not smart enough.
Great video with great, useful information. Thank you.
8:24 Wait, what? Haha, that was a hilarious blooper!
3:12 Yes, love for the process is definitely a good reason to become a data scientist. This reminded me of Michael Jordan‚Äôs contract including a clause on ‚ÄúFor the love of the game‚Äù . I am with you on Grit and Persistence as well as patience as the large skill sets that would shape us to become the unique data scientist we would become takes time, care and nurture. As Rome is not built in a day, becoming a data scientist or being a data scientist can take a lifetime to attain or maintain. Thanks Ken for this thought-proving video!
It's can very well be a "who you know" industry as well. (As many are)

A friend of mine got a job as a data scientist because a company didn't really know what a data scientist is capable of, but through conversations with someone at the company,  explaining what he's learning and able to do they brought him in on a 6 month contract to test the waters.  His work resulted in the company finding inefficiencies in their supply chain that went completely unnoticed for over a decade. Needless to say they offered a full time position and expanded their data analytics/data science department.
Fight to the finish! :)
I have graduated in civil engineering.... But I wanted to be a data scientist... I have picked up a online course from coursera powered by IBM.... & I do follow you as well so that I can get more knowledge.... One day I will be a successful data scientist... ‚ù§Ô∏è
Where do you think the ML engineering field is heading? Saturation the same ?
New look I seeüíØ
I think for me it time management with college and data science and Internship going on hard to handle and also take care of my personal needs etc is hard but putting in efforts also loved your point and reality check this willl help us to make some relatistc expectations and also have backup and be ready adjust a but when time comes üíØüôå
You are amazing and inspiring. Much love.
06:26 was that a wink? ü§£
Despite of all these .. and  No matter how many difficulties will come on the way...   I'll never give up on becoming data scientist.‚ù§
DS will probably eventually just be broken apart.  Data engineers, ML engineers, DAs, etc.  I like the tech side of it personally so I‚Äôm leaning more towards engineering and analysis.  But that‚Äôs just my preference.  It can be hard to break into ‚Äúdata science‚Äù. So I‚Äôd tell people to not get so hung up on the title.  When I finished my internship I had an offer for a data scientist role and a data analyst role.  The DA role played nearly twice as much and used much of the same tech.  Keep your options open.
As an aspiring data scientist thats started out recently... that‚Äôs not the video title I wanted to see
fresh cut ok i see youuu
Thanks for watching everyone! It is an uphill battle, but I still believe that it is possible to make it as a new entrant into this profession!

I'm looking for skills set,basically I'm from EE core branch i don't have any coding knowledge but I want to go with IT sector but I'm confused from where to start whether is data analytics or data science. I just want to start with entry level job but I really want genuine guide on from where I have to start or which role is better to getting fast job.. and in demand, if anyone reading this text then I'm waiting for your positive response ...from admin too @kenJee_ds
I'm currently studying for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. My plan is to start as a Data Analyst, build a strong foundation on coding, maths and statistics, learn ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and OpenCV and eventually transistion into the Computer Vision field as a Data Scientist. Is that a reasonable path to take?
what about complex math like linear algebra? This is my biggest problem. I know all algorithms, but do  not understand the mathematical formulas of e.g. support vector machine, principal component analysis etc. only linear regression is easy -.- I can code and use them but feel like an impostor because I cant explain the math behind them. should I switch to another field like software engineering where is less math?
Waoh!!!
Awesome contents, I am having issue with chosen my programming career as a chattered Accountant.
Which of Data science or Data analysis or Data engineer would you recommend for me?or which is the best programming language an accountant can leverage on to stand out?
Thanks as I anticipate your answer
I wish you mentioned the fact that most data science job postings require a master's degree in data science.
Thank you @Ken Jee, that was really helpful for me since I have interest in Data Science but I still did not figure out how to cross the bridge from Data Analyst. 
Great input üôÇ
Is it even possible to be an analyst with no degree?
I‚Äôm still in undergraduate computer science, but after I get my degree I‚Äôll get a masters in data science. Do you think transitioning from a data engineer to data scientist is easier than data analyst to data scientist? Or is starting from the analyst side easier to transition?
So Data Analyst is a low profile job?
Hello Ken, my goal is to become a ML engineer, I had a Bsc in Mathematics with statistic courses and I'm currently learning ML, data analytic and programming from online courses. Do you suggest me to work as an data analyst 1st, then transits to ML engineer; Or just straight doing ML projects and look for ML engineer? Thanks
Spot on, well said!
Hello bro, which is more comfortable job in personal life? Data Scientist or Data Analyst or Cyber Security?
Historian to data analyst transition possible?
Video saved.
Thank you so much.
My school doesn‚Äôt offer a Master‚Äôs for Data Science, but it does for Data analytics. It is nice to know that there is a path from one to the other. Thank you üëç
honestly, i really like your topics, and i just feel the objectivity in your talks and the way you explain your topics, again that's really helpful for a lot of people, WISH YOU THE BEST
Do you think achieving your PCPP certification is an efficient idea in getting a job or what do you think are the best certifications for becoming a data scientist?
Can u make a playlist for data analyst.. The roadmap for data analyst..
I am very interested in starting a new career in Data Science in Healthcare and was planning to start my learning journey with 365Data Science, Kaggle, or Dataquest. I have a couple of questions: (i) I have a Healthcare business background and was wondering as to which of the three learning platforms mentioned above would be most suitable for me? (ii) You mentioned a set of projects that every person should complete. However,  which are the projects I should work on in Healthcare to make myself more marketable and where and how can I access these projects?
Great video Ken üíØ
My sister is a lead business analyst at citi , is it different from data analyst? I am always confused between these two
Great info.  It also makes sense that, companies would be happy to let a perrson  they already know have the position, than going outside the company and it is a crapshoot.  Quick question though.  Do you think  getting a data science certification would help make your case in transitioning or is that primarily to help get into the field?
Those pull-upsüòÇüòÇüòÇ Great work by the way.
Hello sir I m a data analyst. But in our company I am using only SAP. only creating vendor, extend and blocking. Can I learn data science.
Hi Ken - new subscriber here. Thank you so much for your words of wisdom. Was wondering if you'd have advice for someone in my situation: 

I'm currently a Data Analyst in a social media marketing agency and am looking to do an advanced degree in Data Science. Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science.

However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?
Hey Ken, love your videos. I am on the path to DS now. I was wondering - do you know any good practice problems / data sets using sports (baseball or basketball preferred) to practice on? Always helps to have something you are interested in!
Just found this channel. And I have a dilemma I hope you could help with. I'm in cybersecurity and see how data science is starting to play a large role in threat detection. Can you do a video on that?
Not related to this audio. Do you have a group for all your subscribers where they can interact, discuss doubts and ideas? If not can you make one as you've a huge reach already. Would be really helpful thank you!!
Found your video from a linkedin post about a 'beef' between you and Alex . .. and it just made me even more sad about the job I started 3 weeks ago. I was excited to try an actual dev job after being an analyst for a while - and the recruiter said great things about this company.  But wow, now that I'm here?  3 weeks and almost nothing to do, and I'm not at all confident that there WILL be anything to do, at least nothing that is in the least bit interesting or challenging or creative in any way.  Now i want to be an analyst again!
Hello Ken! What is the different between bioinformatics and data science?
I already have a master degree in Computer Science. I am considering either apply online PhD in Data Science from Northcentral University or online Master in Data Science from University of Michigan on Coursera ? Northcentral university ranked not good among American universities, but it's the only online Data Science PhD in the USA and it only takes 3 and half years to complete. While University of Michigan ranked around 17th among American universities, but I already have a Master degree. Which one would be better for finding data science jobs in USA ? Does ranking matter ? Thanks ! I really appreciate your help !
Lol easy...just change the LinkedIn title. üòÇ

Actually, I am curious on how much time is spent on data pipelines for most data scientists.
As one becoming a data analyst but have regret in the path I'm truly happy that you posted this video! Enrolled the 365 course last week so happy that you mentioned it! Subbed  :D
Also watching this video again your papayas are rotting. Blasphemy! üò§
Is it good to mention our freelance profile with linkedin and github profile in resume?
Hey Ken Jee, wanted to ask, which will you take out of 
1) edx MIT statistics and data science course
2) Google analytics certification course
3) 365 data science course 

For a someone from a health care industry trying to make a break into something more data analytic based??
Hey Ken! I miss your videos, and this is great. 
Need to get back to #66daysofdata 
It‚Äôs really fun to see the format of this video, totally awesome and different for the first 66 ones!
Great tips!!!
Well said Ken. Your delivery is more like a 'think-outside-the-box' than a cookie cutter approach. But since data scientists are not subject matter experts; then, the paradox of shape shifting as analyst or scientist might be the best way to thrive in a job landscape that's always in a flux.
Just in time for me. Just moved to this role from teaching high school and having other data role goals for the future. Any suggestions for creators that talk about visualization to follow ?

Btw I love papayas too!
Such a useful video! Love the tips üòç
Ken, I'm currently enrolled in a MDS program, while my undergrad was in Business Administration. It's a completely new field for me so I don't have any internship/co-op experience in Data Science at all. I wonder what I can do to land a Data Science job straight out of school?
Which cloud technology help in data analyst job?
lol not the stock footage of Tina‚Äôs pomodoro timer, the one that keeps breaking on her lives üòÖ but in all seriousness thank you, very helpful!
Definitely the biggest and best transition of my career thus far
Ken, what is your opinion if someone previously as junior data scientist to senior data analyst?
Great topic! Not watching it yet so I can record my reaction tonight just in case it‚Äôs interesting üòÅ
Good stuff man.. I am a supply chain analyst kind of data analyst, there is a lot of opportunities for data science on this field, but not too many companies have data scientists. I am teaching my self Python and machine learning, I hope to make the transition to data scientist  one day.
"Make sure your resume shows the type of value you've been creating at your current company or in your projects." The latter is all the more reason to not give up hope even if one has a very poor work history with employment gaps.
Hey man thanks for video. I am considering a career in data science and was thinking about taking a role as a data analyst just to get me started down that path.
Great video Ken üôåüèª
Thanks, Ken for this video. Currently, I am looking forward to entering into any data science role so that I can get some work experience.

Which should one prefer first or choose first while applying for entry-level, data engineer or data analyst? As you told in one of your video about different job roles so data engineer comes first so I got this doubt.
Looking forward to the podcast.
Thanks for the great video Ken! This can definitely help me out because I'll be interning as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (tech stack is Python, R, SQL, and Tableau) for econometric modeling and I hope to use your advise for when I transition to either a more senior Data Analyst role past the entry level or even switch to become an actually Data Scientist once I go into industry :'))
This is a fantastic video, Ken. Great tips. Killing it üôåüèª
So, what I got from this video is that after college I can start my career as  a Data Analyst too. I won't be hesitating if I'll be offered a Data Analyst role.
Cool guide man, Im currently in uni going through a data science undergrad program and although Im learning really technical modeling and visualization tools, we really only apply them in a sanitized, scientific setting. Love the insights on DS in the workforce
Thank you for this video.  I am currently in a data analyst role, my boss told me the role is primarily for pulling reports, numbers and insights.  After I get everything done, I work on projects involving automation (we have crappy data structures and lots of manual processes), machine learning (specifically trying to forecast client spending numbers) and NLP (I work in a qualitative field so there are a lot of notes, so I used them for sentiment analysis).  I am hoping this will give me a good base to start applying to data science roles.
I am trying to become a data scientist (in a specific focus area) and according to this list I can call myself a data scientist working using both R and Python. But I haven't felt comfortable calling myself a scientist before understanding enough statistics to make science. Most people are afraid to spend some time to understand statistics but from an employer point of view it's a big leverage.
Great videoüëç
Great video production Ken ! Thanks for the tips :)
The question is how do I go from unemployed to Data Analyst? :(

Great tips, Ken. Thanks!
So insightful! Thank you for sharing your valuable knowledge with us. It was really helpful
If I can do it then literally anyone can
Great video Ken! Many useful tips here, specially for people trying to break into the space.
You are doing great work man :D keep going ^^
I expected an April 1st video trolling everyone somehow for 5 minutes and instead had to wait 1 more day to get actual useful and entertaining information üôÑ.......ü§£

Great video as always.
The timming of this video is on point, just what I needed
Ken nearest Neighbours. So "K means Business".
Well, now that I know how to switch to become a Data Scientist, I HAVE TO NOW!   Great insights as always Ken, I meet a lot of people that are interested in becoming a data scientist but don't consider trying out a data analyst first.  It's a great stepping stone to get you set up for success as a data scientist.  Keep up the content!
Perhaps one of the most important tip for transitioning to data science is to subscribe to Ken's YT channel and KNN podcast üòÜThe new video angle looks nice, the green dinosaur is very prominent ü¶ñ
The creativity level when it comes your content is keep increasing .
Loving this such a great informative videooüíØüôå
Dude, your video intros crack me up every time.
Good that you point out, that a Data Analyst is not inferior to a Data Scientist role. I work in as a Data Scientist in my company, but want to transition into a Data Engineer role, since I don¬¥t really like the math part and want to write more code. You can always listen, a few weeks a product owner in my company said "Damn our data pipelines crash our systems and we do not have a person who is experienced with spark and nobody is experienced with Scala. Bing bing... opportunity. I decided to do an "Ultralearning" challenge and see how much spark and Scala I can learn in 30 days. Lets see if that works out :-).
First one to commentüí´

Thanks for tuning in everyone! Hopefully this gave you some insight on how you can design your workplace for optimal performance. Special thanks to Z by HP and Uplift for helping me to outfit everything. All products I use linked in the description for reference!
How's that Z4 server holding up?

Although their printers aren't bad, I've had some less-than-spectacular experiences with HP computers, but I'm open to giving a second chance.
I need that uplift desk rn :)
That fake papaya in the bedroom üòè
It really does make sense.  In order to get started with schoolwork, I bargain with myself and tell myself "Just sit at the desk and see what happens" and inevitably, I will be able to do at least a Pomodoro or two

wish i had any amazing setup like that . looking forward to buy new laptop so hope so i can make my study and work place well maintain to motivate me haha.
standing desk is life changing, definitely recommend!
Very inspiring video Ken Jee. I am also hoping you would reveal how data science applies to your love for those green fruits. I'm always looking to find them in your videos...not sure what they are?!!
That Omen WASD lighting is super lit! üî•
Lot of good stuff about setting up your environments, but really... I just wanted to say man, that's a lot of papayas. I like that this is a running gag lmao (... or is it? ü§î)
Slick offices Ken! Plus 1 for the  Winston2English model demo at 1:30. Thoughts on the book, Shoot Video That Doesn‚Äôt Suck?
I had no idea HP sets up computers with a data science stack.. thats actually pretty interesting!  Thanks for sharing this Ken!

Did you have an office pre covid or were you always remote?
It won't help me in any way for now. Coz I am a college student .  And my parents won't  give me  money to set up a place as amazing as you've showed us. 
But, yeah after some years when I will start making my own money, I'll definitely design an amazing office .
papayas papayas everywhere in Ken's videos
Thank you Ken. Your content is always interesting
Could you do some videos of applying ML into a live project? Like a chat bot ? Also great vid!
Ken back at it again!
I know this is a super broad question but do you have tips for someone getting into sports analytics. I have pretty good domain knowledge and am learning sql, python and r. Anything else I can do to stand out?
Great video Ken! I can‚Äôt help but wonder, How many papayas in the video? Let‚Äôs see, 1st at 1:50, 2nd at 2:50, 3rd at 4:00 and 4th at 8:01. Am I missing anything?
Wow the office tour is mind blowing, your tech gears are amazing, awesome!
Amazing workplace ! I hope your lower pain issue will be soon gone .. your efforts will surely pay off :)

Before my silly thoughts that I am sure everyone cares about, how I never thought to split work places is beyond me. It's smart and makes a ton of sense.  Thank you.  

It's very Ken Shui. ü§£

How can you focus while balancing on that board though? I would think my focus would be on that and not my tasks. 

Are you heir to some papaya fortune and your channel has become a way to subconsciously pimp them out?

A data science/analytics channel that works with basketball data?! Hell yeah
Did you backtest anything? Why did you opt for a simulation model when predicting game winner without having in-play data? It honestly looks very random what you did with little thoughts to your strategy. This is something I would expect from a very junior data scientist. Not someone having a youtube channel intended to teach data science.
my rant: I think more important ones are matchups - eg one team can win all games all the time vs another team but loose every game to other teams + home court advantage - think betting odds already do this already? and they have a big team of coders/ prob analyst I'm guessing.
Betting on all of your papayas? Damn
I see Ross in you. Organized , love dinosaurs and tidy hair.  No doubt Ross Geller üòé. Jokes apart, I am also brain storming to find my core  for Data Science domain selection.
Quality video once again.  Sign me up for all the sports analytics content.
Hi, I know basics about the models. Now I want to know how and when to use each model like DECISION TREE, CLUSTERING, SVM, K MEANS, K-NN, RANDOM FOREST, NAIVES BAIYES, ETC. I have modeled them all once but I am not sure what kind of interview questions will come with these techniques.  PLEASEEEEE PLEASE REPLY TO THIS QUESTION.
hey PLEASEEEE RESPOND, LOVE YOUR CHANELLL AND FOLLOWING IT TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Yoo I see you're wearing a Virginia sweater - are you an alumni? I'll be starting there as a CS major this coming fall :)

Hi, Great Video! Tell me something: I am building the tennis analyzer system that uses object detection and pose estimation and I would like to know if I should make an web app or a mobile app? What would be more efficient in terms of cost? Thanks
I'm curious about the Stacking you mentioned...to find out what to weight a number of models.  Is that using something like StackingRegressor in sci-kit learn for example?
The best!
Do you plan on doing more NBA game simulation videos? Like incorporating not only previous scores from games, but player stats and trends as well? Found it super interesting and made some additions myself
Do you think that building an Elo ranking might be appropriate for golf? I am trying to build a golf model but I am somewhat lost.
Hi Ken! So I am a Stats undergrad because I want to get into AI. Should I stick with Stats or go to Comp Sci? Thoughts, ideas, opinions? Thanks!
Ken! I made a dataset on Kaggle with all the NBA top shot nfts. I would be curious to see you work your sports analysis magic on it and see if you could find some correlations between player performance in the season and the value of the players moments on the marketplace!
Oh man, not fifty papayas. That's a lot on the line haha

Good reminder to have a simple baseline model to compare to; simplicity is important! Also recognize the Monte Carlo Simulation from the GS/Cleveland video from way back. :D
All the best!
Thanks for the new sports analytics video. I came across many new terms and concepts through this video. Wish you very good luck with the march madness... #PapayaKing
And what's the deal with Papayas. Do you love papayas so much  ?üòÖüòÖ
I didn't understand anything. Still watched the whole video. I don't know why üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
I am not gonna lie, I thought you had said Pot Pie's in the beginning. I was thinking that was a bet I could get behind.
I love sports. This is amazing, Ken.
Lmao I didn't sleep for the last 48 hours to build an ML model and it gave me a bracket thats in 4th to last place in my pool smh
Lke 91¬∫
Thank you man! ;)
Great video! Except the link to the bracket isn‚Äôt working- I believe you posted the link to join your group instead of a link to a viewable bracket
Ok, this is the 3rd time in 2 days I've seen / heard Rothman's book be referenced.  Time to buy it.
I wonder how many people picked Drake to win just because of the name
I am not that into sports .. but trying understand everything you said in this video hahaü§£üíØüôå
This is great content if you wouldn‚Äôt mind. Sharing more about the model averaging and stacking in sports analytics? Is this normal practice what are the most common models for sports analytics... say-basketball in particular ?
Quick story......I live in Vegas. I love sports. 

Obviously, it was only a matter of time before I started thinking I could "beat the book."

Using my brain and spreadsheets wasn't cutting the mustard, so I started researching how people used computers to figure out more efficient ways of being a winning player.

That's when I discovered data science. I then saw how much more to the field there was than just figuring out how to beat Vegas. I was hooked. 

And that is how my data science journey  began.
I miss the T-Rex ü¶ñ
That live-edge dining table at 5:10 is also LIT as üî•
Good to see you back in the sports analytics game! üî•
I know very little about Sports in the US but this seems to be very interesting, as were the DS concepts you shared .. I really hope U win ü§ú
Great video Ken! 1:04 is that a real papaya?
As an Auburn fan, that Virginia vest gives me flashbacks
This is one of the nerdiest and funnest videos I've ever seen.
Heck yeah!! Back to the sports content, loved that you took us through the journey of building this model, awesome to see this perspective!
Hi what do you think about college? Do you think that project based learning is the best way to learn or is it better to learn concepts? Thanks
Hi great video! Sports analytics is definitely cool.
Man is that your place at 5:05?? Got the vibes!
Yes you can.
I certainly DON'T regret sharing my experiences with you all!  Hopefully you can learn from my mistakes! Again, special thanks to 365 Data Science for Supporting the Channel! Link to 57% OFF Their Annual Membership here: https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY
Thanks for  the great video again Ken! I got my pre-acceptance from Warsaw University in the field of Data Science and Business analytics(Master degree) My major at university is Accounting and Audit for know, but at the same time tried to learn some basics of data science and Python programming language. I just wanna ask you  that, If let's say I accepted the offer from WArsaw university and went there, would it be difficult for me to keep up with the other guys? I mean, probably most of them already would know Python or R , computer science and etc, but I am kinda new at this field.
Thanku for sharing your experience!
Hey there. I really hope someone sees this. I just recently dropped out of accounting, i have a 4.0 GPA, so it's not because I didn't perform, I just didn't love it...Now, I'm considering a Masters degree in BI, and I have to admit...For someone who's never ever switched tracks, I'm freaking out...I don't really like excel, I'm scared of coding (I've never done it) and the last time I touched statistics was an introductory class in my first year in Uni...I want to be in marketing later on, but the master's degree in marketing isn't valuable (bad placement rate, and low start salary). BI seems to be something that might give me an edge in marketing, and in an of itself, it's valued on the market and pays well of the bat. I'm really struggling right now, because I'm starting to think I should've stayed in accounting, since at least it was clear what the progression of the career would be...Someone please help me! I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown,
Love the video Ken, Good execution! I think I definitely relate to the project demonstration point.
Could I have a bachelors in industrial engineering and a minor in statistics for data science?
Can I ask you guys title Suggestion of thesis undergradute in Data science, or analyst field.
I really stucked :(
Is it a wise move if I give my all to sql, i dont know, I just like the language. I am currently on a masters in data science program, and they are literally teaching us R, Python and Sql at the same time. please give me an advice
Excellent Insights and so relatable. I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science and if there is one word that can describe the transition its 'persistence' and only 'persistence' :)
Hey...Hope you're doing well. Forrest Knight brought me here. Looking forward to watching your videos. Thanks.
Thanks for the promo code! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Great video! Im thinking of going into consuming and just watched your video with Gleb, but I was wondering if you can do more a couple videos on data freelancing and getting clients and stuff like that because I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm marketing honestly.
If I had no regrets I wouldn't being here on your channel. If I wouldn't fail at university, I would not start to become Data Scientist.
This is so useful, I love you videos! What are your thoughts on SAS? I heard it is an industry standard and a lot of big companies use it. Do you think its worth devoting time to?
I do not have any data science friends. If anyone is down to learn and study with me and is pretty chill, shoot me a message on discord at Losebow#9664
Mate You are Discouraging me üòí
I think you cannot just compare now and back then; there are a lot more quality courses and people who are willing to share, i.e. handsome you. Also, it has become more acceptable and normal for people to take up online courses rather than attending physical schools.
Ken Jee, thanks for sharing your personal experiences! In grad school right now, and I love listening to your podcasts on my runs <3
I hear ya on languages. In the Intro to Data Science course I used to teach, we positioned the class as "language agnostic" so I ended up doing every demo in Excel, R, and Python. It made my head spin and I was constantly crossing up the syntaxes. Working only in Python for the past year has made all the difference.
Hey Ken, I just started an online data science degree this past Jan.  I was wondering a couple things:

Why exactly was the design principles course so helpful?  This is also in my curriculum.

Is it uncommon to continue taking classes WHILE working internships?

I work full time and am nervous about leaving my job to find internships without the promise of a job afterwards.  Was thinking I might start searching for internships once I only have a few classes left so that I might finish the degree during the internship.
Focusing on one language at a time. I feel. I had to go back and forth between Python and R because of internship and coursework which made it take longer to build on understanding. In addition, one thing that isn't really talked about is mental health in data. I feel that mental health and burnout have been two ways that led to my own personal career setback. These would be great topics that I believe could add significant value.

Thanks again for being transparent!
Thanks for sharing the experience to us.
Nice video Ken!! I loved the philosophical ending words.
ALTERNATE QUESTION: If you were starting from scratch today, but with the knowledge of your regrets and struggles (keeping in mind that everything has changed since you began and continues to evolve) how would you proceed? More specifically, how would you "learn Python"? With so many ways it can be applied, it's like saying "learn to use a computer".
My biggest obstacle is that companies have a hard on for prior experience. If you haven‚Äôt done a project with their specific technology stack then they look elsewhere even if you‚Äôre the better data scientist or data engineer, whatever you want to call it, in terms of learning new things, being motivated, taking pride in your work, etc.
I'm just now starting a library info science masters with a certificate of advance study in data science with a full ride. I am def nervous and hope I can follow through with the data courses. I wish I knew more about how to get by in these data science courses bv I'm worried about maintaining a GPA for scholarships.
Like 108¬∫
Greatly explained
My regrets :
- structured my studies and followed it religiously .
- always changing resources and not sticking to one.
- wished I knew before that working as intern in startup that your role doens't define what work you will working in a startup can be bug Hassel and proper guidance is something which lacks but of course you get a lot of knowledge in these experiences.
I believe we usually tend to choose an optimal strategy based on our present situation, whose benefits are only seen on the long term. For example in Morocco, I have to get a Master's Degree, but online courses, assignments and exams take all my time and energy .. Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding .. I also believe that you wouldn't bother us today on YouTube if you were socially active in University or studied just one Degree :3 so as you said, I'm Glad things turned out the way there are now
I was also confused between R and Python but I started learning Python because the jobs or work which I want to do is more in Python üòÄ

Hey, If you don't mind I have one question... Why you learned C, Java as you are in data science? 

66daysofdata is a nice communityüôåüôå

What are the different ways of documenting the journey? Like YouTube videos or blogs. Anything else you can suggest?

Literally I'm also regreting not doing projects during college and I was also failed to utilise my lockdown time. These I joined a company so I have less time sometimes.

But, now is also good. Whatever happens it happens for good. Keeping this mindset helping me to go ahead üòÄ
Ah Ken, I have this immense love for this field. I'll be trying to apply more from now on. I wish there were more free resources like kaggle. In Pakistan we don't even have Paypal to access these course. Well thank you for this video ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫ now gonna go back to work
Heck yeah!  I fell into the same trap here with R & Python!  Luckily I finally figured out to just go with only the better language! hehe
Finished round 2 of #66daysofdata the day before. What did I gain by doing so people might ask. Well I just got accepted to work on a DS/ML project at my company yesterday. No online course/bootcamp could give you results that quickly I guessüòÇ.
0:20 Let‚Äôs go to 1M! üöÄ üöÄ 7:55 This resonated with me as well, obstacles or failures helps us improve, as Ray Dalio puts it Pain + Reflection = Progress. Oh and just noticed the nice Brachiosaurus in the background!
Thank you for sharing your regrets. Some of them also apply to me.
Well done Ken!
Hope your channel grows,you really try to help the community a lot.
Seeing your videos motivates me.
That wink üòÜüòç
Really struggling with retention. That's my biggest struggle. 

Biggest regret was not starting sooner. At 40 I'm worried about potential agism and not being able to move to accept a job if I'm ever able to finally grasp any of this.
Solid execution! I love it haha
Yeah, these points are worth considering in my journey as well. Thanks for sharing, Ken.
I am just starting. So, I don't know what is my regret. I am starting with python and I do write code but I get distracted and start learning something else . Youtube suggested so much. But then I reprimanded myself and try to learn the first thing I had started. In hope that I'll be able to get hold of the things.
Q: 01:00 and 6:52 what happened to the T-Rex? 
A: He regrets (see what I did there?) being a carnivore so changed to a Brachiosaurus to get some of those juicy papaya! ü§£
First comment yes! üí™ going to watch the video now...
Waiting for this to shoot up.
Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know in the comments below if you would like to see more vlog style videos like these!
I mostly that your job is so flexible üôåüëèüëè
Had to re visit this video! You should do another video like this since it's round 3 of #66DaysofData!
Imagine winning against time #cantrelate
Time and I have an oft adversarial relationship as well.  I have been working on it.  Btw, how did you do in the March Madness competition?
I am also struggling with my daily execution plan..
Hey man, love your channel! Glad to see that I am not the only person that struggles with daily time management.  I am currently experimenting with the Pomodoro technique and have tried a time-keeping device "Timeular" that tracks how much time I spend on a certain topic. Any favorite techniques/devices/apps that you use to stay on your game?
Wow that is such a green landscape backdrop!!!  So jealous!!!
Hi Ken, first of all  love this content and would encourage you to keep on experimenting with it  ! Secondly, I recently landed an internship posiiton at a fitness company (prefer to keep it unnamed) and will most probably work on projects that use DS and ML in improving athletes' performances. Do you have any recommendations on books or content related to this subject that I can check out from now till summer so I can knock It out of the park ? Thanks !
I have to balance my time between working a full time software engineering job, working on a DS project, gym and watching your content üòÅ
Learn ArcGIS? You want to do a video about it? :)
can we rename this: "A day in the life of the (ML) Maestro?" ;) And why Maestro might you ask? Well, I often hear Data science, Machine Learning and A.I. be described as being more art than science that's why ;)
Great video Ken, and love the whiteboarding and amazing outdoor shots!
Excited to see that you will be a speaker at DataCATED!
Whiteboard game strong. Audio game strong. Phone in drawer game strong. Dad nap game strong. Stand up desk game strong. Riding bike whilst reading (this made me laugh hahaha) game strong. Scarf game strong.

Also never eaten Vietnamese food???? Wtf
Hi Ken, Miles Davis once said, "Time isn't the main thing. It's the only thing". Cheers.
Loved the vlog style ! Great place and I like how you joke around with your Dad :3 God Bless you both
Haha you indeed win the battle. Thank you for the video. Am gonna create categories too for my time battle.
Yes, you did a great job! A productive day in the life ... The desk from uplift looks amazing, did you get a Herman Miller to go with that? üòÜ
2:55 Papayas seems to be a family favorite üòÜ
More Vlogs!  Why didn't this vlog include the token wake-up scene?  Ya know, where people record themselves waking up, but how do they do it if they weren't up already? ü§î
How is your handwriting so nice tho! Also loved the vlog - do more pls :D
Wow... The location is beautiful when you was driving the car üòç

I think you love papaya very much üòÇ Is there any story behind that?

Also your schedule is really good... Also your clocks are coolüòÄ...
That shot showing all the equipment at 2:05 is why I don't see myself making videos haha. Seemed like a productive day. :D
Ken got more done in 13 hours than I have in a week.......I took 2 naps on Saturday. Lol

In all honesty, the white board method I've adopted from you is a life hanger and I recommend it to everyone. 

How was the Burmese food?
I like the vlog feel you are closed to us
Wow what a wonderful day
i was smilling through the video for no particular reason
Love the vlog! But slight recommendation - change that workout to surfingüòâ
Lovely desk and thanks for giving insight to an important topic.
Great time management I wish I could be as productive as you ..well got inspiration so have to go forward with it thenüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇüíØ
I really wish I had a book... thinking of buying hands on ML book but damn it cost More than 2k in my currency üòÇüòÇüíØ
Nice one Ken! Keep up the good content! Also spotted the usuals at 2:38 and 2:58 üòÖ.
wow, your'e really becoming my fav on u tube, hope to meet u one day, drink some coffee together
You're going greattt! Loved the video
Hey Ken how do you manage reading these books and retain that info efficiently? I'm reading tha Hands on machine learning and I like to take notes while reading it, but it takes too long ü•∫

Super exciting news Ken! Looking forward to the playlist! That leaderboard UI looks dope
Awesome video, goodluck with this!
Hello, how could I put an app like SwingVision on the cloud? How much would it cost? Thanks
Hey Ken Jee, answer my doubt: it is good to be a software developer before going to data science?
Hey Ken! I
 have been learning data science for the last year. and I have one problem which I often face and can't find the answer to. which learning an algorithm, we get the logic behind it. we learn the intuition behind the algorithm. but while doing a project, and actually applying those algorithms, we see a lot of parameters, literally 20-50 parameters. and I personally don't get the intuition behind all those parameters. looking at those parameters makes it more complex. when I search on the internet, it says that "usually we use this value for this parameters ". but can't find the reason. Also, while learning deep learning, it's too difficult to find an answer to my doubt. I hope you got what my problem is... let me know your view on it. 
Also, I love your content. :D
Amazing! Looking forward to see the  final product.
This is SO cool! I'll be a beta user and would love to collab as a data product manager if you're open to it :)
This is out of topic but may i ask.. im planing to have a dataquest bootcamp.. is it ok or is kaggle enough to learn data science? Thank you in advance for your reply!
Very excited about this and I'm looking forward to using your service
Love the creativity used to communicate points in @Ken's YouTube videos. It makes everything stick
Great news! I would like to watch the journey of this great team through this peoject!!

One Note: on your Partnerships page the link for 365 Data Science is broken.
Awesome video, after watching decided to build my own website would love to hear your thoughts on it 
www.louislane.io
Hello!

I am a big fan of your channel and your content helps me learn data science and ML

I am a tennis player and I was thinking on how I could apply data analytics to my game. I did some research and I found a startup called SwingVision that analyses your game using AI.

I thought that I could do something similar mixing my passion of tennis and AI. I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas?

Thank you, ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Daniel


P.S. If you know about potential applications of Data Science and Machine Learning on Marketing and Business please tell me. Happy to hear from you
- Everyone: WIX is bad
- Ken: I really liked working with them
- Everyone: I suppose I'd give them a try :3
Why would anyone take a portfolio site made on wix seriously?
Hey Ken, Could you please do an Interview Guide video for us? LOVE YOUR CONTENT!! üíØ
Hey ken, let's share our music playlists.
I've been working on my portfolio and currently learning supervised/unsupervised learning. I know you've said making your own site looks good for companies perspective. Using Wix, will that decrease my chances vs making my own site?
Dude I love KJ. Keep sharing amazing content.
Loved the last portfolio website collaboration you and Data Professor did using Hugo! I still use it to this day and constantly get compliments on it.

Going to give this a try as well, thank you Ken!
Hey, Congratulations for collaboration with WixüòÄüôå
It's really important to integrate the whole things at one place in sorted manner...
Thanks for the website... Hoping for the journey to be more interesting...‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
if you made this video with HTML and CSS instead if WIX that would be huge
I bought my name as a dot com domain about 8 months ago because of your recommendation so it's ready for when I'm putting my portfolio out there. Thank you

Or to prevent any potential enemies from slandering me. ü§£ data science brings the wolves out. Lol
quick question:
after sometime if i want to change something will i have to redo the whole thing or the website will already have my portfolio so i just have to edit.?
ps: Amazing name of news letter signing up right now .
Great video as always!
Making a portfolio has been in my agenda for a couple of months now. I kept pushing it back cause in my head i wanted to code the whole thing from scratch - now I'm thinking, will that be worth it seeing how i can use platforms like wix instead.. 
but also, i don't have that much data science work to display (i'm a computer science graduate with a few ds courses and projects) so maybe making it from scratch will be another way to showoff my work in itself? It's gonna be way more work so I'm wondering now which option should I do :/
This is awesome ...if I remember I did suggested a video on portfolio üíØ you never fail to amaze us 
Thank youüôåüíØ
"Noah: Do you care if they follow you on Medium"
"Me: Hmm..yes?" üòÜ
Great video Ken! Congrats on the happy randomness! Wow this is so cool, also a big fan of Noah Kagan. Data Dribble is such a great name. I also started a newsletter after watching Noah's video. Wix looks very intuitive, the auto-play feature of YouTube videos is so cool.
Like 27¬∫
It's been a while since I've been here or the discord channel. I've been a bit overwhelmed. One of the many things I have trouble right now is doing what you explain in this video ... building a presence on the web. So, all you're saying in there, quite valuable. Also, it is giving the boost and motivation I need to start.
Link is broken!
Hii
Thanks for watching everyone! Obviously I'm back to data science now, but this was a very interesting short term career pivot for me. I hope that this video helps you to better understand what goes into making a career decision. I also hope that you enjoy my admittedly weird sense of humor, dinosaurs, and papayas.

Hey im an intern and i already want to quit this shit üò≠üò≠ f it
Finally watched this after 2 years... the introduction is 10/10
I moved from mechanical engineering to project management about a year ago. What your describing sounds like a very similar experience. It's been less than I deal to say the least. I'm now looking into a career shift into data science.
Some people call it ‚ÄúSelling out.‚Äù I call it ‚ÄúGetting paid what you‚Äôre worth.‚Äù
Did Cyber security is better than Data Science jobs?
I'm a 1st year students majoring in CSE(Data science) I'm really confused or have no idea to choose project. I really wanna work on some project but don't know where to begin or how to do? It'd be grateful if you could help me regarding this.
Ken ƒ± guess it is little hard to try out different roles Most of the companies looking for "experieced in the title" roles. Even if for example, I would be a great product owner or product manager, sisnce my title is system engineer, when HR sees that title, they say nahh, we need "in title experience" individual. I guess If someone can swith role, it is also "ƒ± guess" chance factor is really important.
MBA or data science which is best???
Thanks for making this video ken. I am just trying to break in, but turns out ,there's much more to life.
As a person who has left a very technical role in a small fast startup to a bigger, corporate-like env, I can truly relate to you. All I do is to do project scoping for data science projects, framing the models to the business use cases, and watch vendors do the fun data science stuff. I kind of miss the hustle in the startup though. I guess life is not perfect.
you sounds like pat bateman
In other words, why everyone switches career. And btw, he took a break, not quit.
Ken Jee? how old were you when you first started the data science?
Is that a RRD windsurf board in your garden? ü§©
I'm currently learning Data Science but find it to be VERY VERY BORING. Don't know about others, but I don't know how long will I be able to continue in this.. 

Whoever's reading this, it's very appealing to enter this field but the inside story is very different. Please try some trainings a lot before entering this field.
Most data scientists  arn't real scientists. Unless you have a ph.d. and do research, then you are a true data scientist.
Are you currently a data scientist?
Haha I love the light-up dinosaur!

I'm thinking about transitioning to data science field ,and what you said about what you'd missed about data science resonated much with what I miss about engineering.
Thank you for sharing your experience and expertise!
Man your intro direction is interesting

I just want to write good sql at my job.
Follow your passion rather than following what Sharma Uncle's son is doing or what entire world is doing. now a days every Tom ,Dick and Harry are learning data science without much insight into Statistics , in interview they are not able to tell what is formula for slope, what is discrete variable etc.  Data science is more statistician job rather that software engineer job,  ppl are learning even getting job also , but what impact they are giving to society ?  A  Data science is one who resolves the most complex problem in the world. using Maths , Science and Probability. Not a easy job at the same time not imposssible , most ppl are trying for salary , its requires more passion , focus ,discipline than any other field
What is your advice for people from engineering like me to pursue data science career?
The biggest challenge & how to manage?
This guy: I quit Data Science. FOR TWO DAYS ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you would look in photo it is I quit green tea not I quit data science lol.
Why are there so many YouTuber that I subscribe quiting their data science job?
As someone who's planning to start their second career path in Data Science, at 32, after going down the project management path... I fully sympathize with not being a personality fit for the PM role.
üòÇ Data Science.  Why would I pay idiots to do DS when it comes out of the box with automation platforms like ServiceNow.  The AI engine makes data scientists look like they did 20 years ago when Academia busted ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù for being a fraudulent con game.
You're a fool, don't you know when you dream in code the code dreams in you.
You've got the vibe of "Vegetable Police/Vegetable conspiracies"
Nooooooooooooo.......you murdered it. Btw does your company provide internship?
Sometimes we quit Data Science, but Data Science doesn't quit us!
I'll be farmer and grow green tea
The title is clickbait. You should have titled, why I quit data science in 2018.
ew CFOP
I thought this was a sign for me to quit Data Science
I agree with you 100%
What editing software do you use?  Just wondering.
Sir nowadays data science and data analyst job are so difficult ....the company calls us and tell us to pay money for training is this relevant???.....i mean why to pay money cant they give us a job by our skills???
Spoken Turley. I am certified PMP and I work with people all day long. Once a person asked me  what is a problem on a project. I replied " any independent entity that has logic and reasoning, embedded with emotions, is/can be a problem on a project."
What is your mbti type?
Green teaüòÇ
i want to be your assistant.üëçüèª
Oh... The past tense for quit is quit.
Thank you for this video, I  just switched and started my journey in DS and its difficult, but  your channel really helps a lot to make its less difficult. You are inspire me :)
I respect you, always have been. But this IS a click-bait. Didn't liked it.
Thank you, very interesting
Saw the title and I know I wasn't the only one who had a mini heart attack
Hi Ken Jee! Thank you for sharing your experience. I totally understand you. I‚Äôm a project manager right now, but miss data science a lot. I try to squeeze every ounce of work with data that I can right now, but am constantly met with hurdles...

Looking forward to getting back to data!
This applies for any job in our life. People get bored doing the same thing for a long time
did I come to the wrong channel? nah.. that's Ken .. üòÖüòÖüòÖ make some more series like these..
I totally agree with this person, I worked for 2 years in this field and now I quit it trying to explore data journalism. Data science is for sure overrated. 
My humble request, dont fall for hype, understand thee reality and then get started.
People searching on Google: How to enter the Data Science industry
This gentleman:-
After watching this video, I quit Green Tea. üòÅ
Where's joma when you need him
great perspective, I know I would love hands-on work more than managing people any day
Oh, a data science and Netflix series in one, huh? Sweet!
The thumbnail got me üòÇ
If you don‚Äôt know, green tea means another lover in Asia
Do you need PhD for ai research?
I like the way you create your videos Ken. Very informative but also entertaining and just the right length. Switching up scenes is also a good touch.
I started learning data science due to the hype created in the market. I forced myself to take interest cuz everyone was doing it. I watched a lot of tutorial, read blogs, made account on kaggle, read research paper on GAN, open ai and list goes on. But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models. So I recommend everyone to give a try to every field out there, don't follow the herd mentality and explore it, read about it and then decide what's suits you and stick to it.
Enjoyed ur ending üòÇ
11.647 my inbox wins!!! :D :D
People that don't have a passion for statistics going into DS are always so shocked that they hate it.
Yes Ken. Agreed. We need to explore our potentials rather than limiting our thoughts to just one thing
well if you DID quit data science you would aptly qualify for a film-making role
I believe theres a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble. And finally gets us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want most, even our dreams.
In my opinion Ken you're introvert and that's why job with a lot of contact with people didn't suit you well.
In big five scale in my opinion you're high in openess, low in agreableness, high in concienciousness and probably more introverted. In MBTI scale it would be INTJ type. This would explain why you don't like managing people but rather choose your own path and improve yourslelf. You also have strong analytical skills and this is your the most powerfull trait.
Hovever I can be wrong becouse my statments are based only on your videos.
This videos shows  one reason y u r  attracted to  data science, storytelling is your artüòâüòÅ
Interesting, unexpected, but appreciated because part of the journey exploration is a common thought for many people. 

Love the overall portrayal as well a nice scene change.
Data science is like that ex who broke up with you but you still love him/her. Eventually you'll get back to it.
Gotta admit I laughed at that T-rex Toy
Was that how you discovered that would were a friggin‚Äô PSYCHOPATH too?! XDDD
How can I get a data scientist job without a bachelor's degree?
I knew that we have something in common. We are both extrovert.
For me: I started to study to become a full stack developer, but I really like more data science area. I love everything about computer science field, but I rather prefer analyse than build. Web and software development skills are welcome as well.
This was really fun.
Oh great. Now I'm gonna have nightmares.
Well, technically he's right, it wasn't clickbait...
The ending though üòÅüòÅ
You look like Elon Musk
are you an ENTP? ü§î im pretty sure ur at least ENxx
I was really astonished by the title like ‚ÄúOh! my heart‚Äù yet I‚Äôve to tell that I‚Äôm really happy for you going through these journey, we should try different things from time to time in all aspects, and each different trial will add to us something different that we can harness to improve the ‚Äúoverall‚Äù of ourselves.
Inspiring as ever, thanks ken üëçüëç
Hi I have experience on data science from the last 3 years. I worked on different projects e.g: recommendation system, data mining, deep learning projects, machine learning projects and some analytical projects. But the problem is that i cannot properly find a work or a proper job. Sometimes I earn through projects but most of the time I didn't earn projects and their is no scope in our country in a field of data science. So I need your help what do I do ? Because already I have given many years to code so what to do next how do I find a proper work ? Thank you
Wow! you scared me for a second!
Even if you quit I'll " stay true to the process " as u told me once, but looking at the comments you'll never be able to quit üòÇ ( unless U open a papayas' project, I'm sure everyone will understand then :3 )
I have a technical question, being a self learning , do i have to learn ETL and pipeline in order to be able to fine a job
I almost done with all the requirements you‚Äôve mentioned earlier on your educational suggested path 
The only 2 things i do really know are ETL/ pipeline 
Am confused 
Guide me please am really lost and I don‚Äôt have anyone but you
We love you kenny!!
Another amazing video ‚ù§Ô∏è
Always informative
Thanks for sharing your story. I also quit doing full time Data Science after 1.5 years. I became a Tech Lead to explore more of leadership position and for career growth purposes. I am happy that I explored this option and found a way to still do Data Science within my new role after sometime.
Excellent video, very nuanced and I appreciate the portion where you covered what you gained from that experience.
There is always this moment in life when we are low, where we stop and think about what we do. Then take a step back to change the route or move forward with more intensity... its good you did what you wanna do coz most people scare to take a step back and loose their intensity , passion in long run.
WHY ARE YOU DRINKING APPLE JUICE??!!?!?

edit:

okay everyone calm down its just green tea
well i def clicked on the video. interesting insights. idk if i would like product management or not, maybe if i could do half DS and half PM...
The business side of technical projects can definitely be a tough transition for people. 

It‚Äôs good that this video shows that people can and should explore other non-technical roles.
Mehn Ken, you got my BP high when the video started.
Like seriously?ü§£
Green Tea üòÄ
Thank you for this most awesome clickbait!
Man, I feel what you are saying about management and being in charge of a group of people. I did the same, moved to a management position after 5 years as a network engineer and it was awful lol, I was constantly being pressured to deliver the projects, and dealing with the different personalities in a group can be exhausting not the mention the micro-management and seeing how your inbox kept piling can definitely drive you insane. I lasted two years in that position, I quit and now I'm preparing to land a job in data science. Wish me luck xd
it is a very silly video!
I definitely won‚Äôt be sleeping tonight c:
Clickbait.
Lol this was great. I‚Äôm trying to transition from business analytics consultant to data science but I do actually like the business/people soft part and I‚Äôm good at it. But I want to try something new and get technical again since I‚Äôm getting my masters.
Like others in the comments section, I too was shocked to see the video's thumbnail, glad it was all in the past and that the experience helped you to amplify your passion in data science. Just as I was wondering if it was whisky, 0:51 okay got it. Just pondering, could the papaya serve as a methaphor? Hmm... The ending was really an attention grabber, looking forward to the sequel!
Love the whole papayas touch
Thank you for the candid review of your career, Ken. Off-topic question: I noticed in the description you listed the webcam and some other stuff you use. Would you mind letting me know what video recording and editing software you're using? I'm thinking of turning some DS projects into videos and hosting them online for prospective employers. Have a great weekend!
D: What, why? oh, it was just a clickbaity title...
What a surprise at the end of the video üòÇ
The amount of self awareness and self reflection shown in this video is awesome. Thanks for sharing.

(Also what a wacky video - in a good way.)
Even if it was clickbait, you are forgiven :) 
Do what makes you happy, but please continue making such awesome youtube content. You rock üåû‚úîüëå
Saying it is not clickbait but it's still clickbait.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Cannot be more clickbait title. Would have appreciated a title similar to "Why did I quit Data Science in the past"...
wow your lighting  look cinematic, just like it's created by a professional filmmaker! ... Good job Sir
Last 30 seconds music is like bollywood movie scene... üòÇüòÇ
Ouuf, I thought this dramatic title was real ... I never click on a video so quickly
That was good üòÇüòÇ At first I was also shocked and then started thinking that you will upload videos of project management... But at half of video I gone through comments then truth got reviled üòÇüòÇ
Man, don't give us a heart attack like that. Jeez. Lol.
That was awesome! Fun Intro and a cliffhanger ending. I am genuinely worried about the Pappaya now üòÇ.
Great content as usual üî•
I don't know Ken, it looks kind of click baity to me! XD
I really thought for a sec that you quit now and then I was like thank god it was about before üòÇüíØ
2:12 please tell me ken, how do you quickly learn business domain problems after entering the company?
I didn't read the description and gave myself a mini heart attack. My mind went " WHAT? Ken quit? What chance do I have?". I know, I know, over dramatic. Your videos are getting more and more entertaining. Loving them Ken.
Bait
The first thing  I said to myself was, what????? you quit???? why?????????
I did not know that you had quit!
Ken looks like divorced husband of 3 in the thumbnail. 

Not many people are self-aware enough to know what they want.  Kudos to you for figuring it out!
One thing I like the most about your channel is that your videos are so concise. You value your viewers' time. That alone makes your channel stand out from the rest.
this guy should be a storyteller, not a data scientist
Clickbait
Great video Ken! As a data science lead, I feed the same when it comes to managing other scientists and not coding as much. I always try to balance it out but it is very challenging
great tip
That intro lol üòÇ
You had me ngl.
Ken , please quit I want your job ;)
üò•
ü§£ You and that Pawpaw!
As soon as I saw a notification, I clicked on it to see what actually happened to you, Ken! But it's good to share your incredible journey with us, lots of stuff to learn from your journey. Thanks once again for sharing with us. The last part of the video was a bit scary, but your smile made it amazing : ). To be continued...üòâüòâ
You sir are a badass
I was really scared there for a second!
(For the papaya, of course.....)   ;)
The quality of this video is on another level üî•üî•
Omg ! Unbelievable
Life with a T-Rex as a child is rough ü§£
I THOUGHT YOU WERE QUITTING RIGHT NOW, AND MY HEART STOPPED
whatttttttt??????
He * turned on* the dinosaur
Thanks for watching my video everyone! Hopefully it burns the concept into your memory (HA). I know I won't forget making this one üò≠!
You deserve a sub after eating that habanero üò≠
Commitment üòÇ
LMAO! The tears! üòÇ
Unique data science explaination üòÇ
That seemed spicyü•µ
WHY the habaneros?!! üò≠
omg , why did you do that.
Wow
He is so passionate about data science that he started crying.
üòÇüòÇ
brilliant!
why do you have to put yourself under such pressure!!! üòÇüòÇ
Thanks very much for your presentation at DATAcated. Could you please share more about that your friend's job application tracking projects? Thanks in advance.
Hi, ken, 
Can you suggest to me how can I build my profile for a data science masters? What things should I do as I have one year with me?
I will be a great help!
Hey Ken, I got into Georgetown's MS in Data Science program. Do you think it is a reputable program?
Is that you telling us choosing data science was a mistake? I‚Äôm sure eating that yellow paper was definitely a mistake.  If not enlighten is on the correlation between data science and the eating that yellow pepper because I did not catch it.
Hi Ken, I have 2 small questions regarding my data science journey. I am at the intermediate level in Data Science and have done a couple of projects and have become quite comfortable tackling beginner/intermediate problems, however I feel that my coding skills are very limited to DS, do you think I should learn new skills (ex; web development), or do you think sticking to DS related coding is enough to get me into the industry? My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ? Thanks for all the hard work
Hi Ken! I have a question for you if you don't mind, I am starting my first data science project for potential employers now while searching for jobs. Is it okey to create a project that have been created by someone else before or do I have to come up with a new project (a new idea)? Thank you! :)
When you use very noisy and misleading feature
This may be unrelated to the video but I would like to know your opinion best resources to get interview practice for data science Jobs. Specifically the technical portion. I've looked at hackerrank leetcode etc. But I feel that those are more directed for full stack developers? Any feedback would help.
Now do it for one hot encoding. ;)
This is the perfect example of problem solving without understanding the content of "dataset" üòÇ. Your rock ü§òüèª
HAHA, Can I am doing certification. Can you suggest me data science project for beginners?
All your pain culminated in that single teardrop üò≠ü•µ
LOL ANALYSIS NOT KLEAR. EATZ MOAR PEPPERZ.
I'm literally wincing along with you üòÇ
LOOOL this was great
Oouch.. did you just eat that!!
Please release a backstage footage of this video
Haha, Ken the killer üéâ You know the spice of life!
üî• üî• üî•
make this a weekly thing LOL
hahaha this is great! When the heat kicks in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtqQYqRNDGI&t=41s - Do I hear a challenge for @ForrestKnight and @KeithGalli ?
the cmap of you face in this video it's something I would use on my many of my visualizations hahaha
You literally spiced it upü§Ø
Damn I can't bare too spicy 
Take care üíØafter this you will needüòÇ
Ken so excited about the algorithms used in DS that he shed a tear :D
Great display that you have to keep the audience entertained so they listen to your message, also applicable when presenting you data findings. Great video and R.I.P your tastebuds
great explanation, now drink some milk!
OMG... KEN why you hav eaten habanero üå∂Ô∏èüò¨üò¨üò¨ for explaining this... But due to this trick we can't never forget what you have said in this video....üòÇüòÇ thanks for the explanation...
Hahaha Amazing <3
0:45 hahaha aw Ken don‚Äôt cry üò¢
This video: Hot topics ... (Ken eats habanero pepper while explaining)
Next video: Cool topics ... (Ken eats ice/ice cream while explaining?)
Great #shorts video Ken, thanks for the big effort!
üòÇüòÇ The rest of the video was not published for obvious reasons :3
"I massively regret that" 

Understatement of the year award goes to.......lol

I couldn't breathe and I was just watching. ü§£
literally hot topics ! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Haha so hot
Shouldn't have eaten it.üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è
It Looked you're regretting choosing Data Science üòÇüòÇ as a profession üòÇ
Somehow I can feel your pain while watching it!! Amazing idea to promote your channel  hahah
I Would like to see your Course on Udemy Ken Jee ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks a lot ken. This really helped me out a lot.
Just started reading book One Thing as per your advice. Thanks for great content .
Another helpful video! Keep up the good work ken!
Finally, I got to know that the sleeping old man in the end of your videos is your dad. Initially, I thought it was an edit or something.  But the sleeping man finally talked üòÇüòÇüòÇ. And yeah YouTube recommending your old videos and I can't help myself and watch these.
Learning aside... I come to this nearest neighbor just to unwind sometimes... content is therapeutic in its own kind of way.
It is really good that you are verifying the quality of brands because we are in search of good sources and it shows your honesty towards your audience.
These are much-needed techniques to manage my time efficiently...
These are great tips. I need to incorporate some of these!
please sir make a video on cloud computing required for data science
i have been considering how to shift to data science and strategically learn. i swear your channel is a gold mine of helpful info and when i think of my next question... sure enough its the topic of the next suggested video. subscribed and thank you!!
Ken, I absolutely need that shirt.
Thank you so much for the helpful content. Just a quick question. For a beginner in Data Science and just knowing basic programming tools and a little stat, do you think it‚Äôs better to learning a little more or start building a project as soon as possible?
Ken..FYI I landed an internship from May for 6 months.. thanks to your extremely valuable advice. It did help a lot.
Have a question
- I do plan 3 months month week and day. I want to ask..How many times does it not go your way..or you don't feel like doing it or something else comes up and how you deal with it..
My one most important thing is learning something that will make me a better data scientist every single day..
Question of the day: Did the T-Rex head lamp move (0:39 & 11:40), or does Ken have two of them?
Hi, I am new to data science course and I do not have any programming related background and I wanted to  do my master's so in which course I should do my master's and please tell the course which is less expensive
Thanks for the video Ken! Focusing on one thing and having a schedule really resonates with me.
I loooove your podcast name, so clever.
Definitely needed a video like this in my life right now. Now I just need to work on staying focused and putting all of my attention on one thing at a time.
Another great video Ken!. You did talk about this but I think your merch (Ken's nearest neighbors) would do well!  #NoPapayasWereHarmed!
Don't forget to delegate :)
Some golden nuggets in here. Great video
Great video Ken! Those are some solid tips and great everyday remindersüëå
Absolutely best video about this topic I have ever seen :D
Hello ken,
I have completed MBA and have 2 years of experience in Business Analytics field
I am planning to do MS in business analytics is it worth or should I stick to my Business analytics
Waiting for positive reply 
Thankyou
This is definitely life changing üî•üôå
Thanks for sharing these tips. They're really helpful!
That papaya balancing though üòÇ
Gonna start implementing these steps in my life so I can stop editing videos at 2am üòì
Dude. You literally just addressed the central crisis of my professional life right now. Love the guidance and I've added that book to my list as well.
A true guru in the making. You have surely changed my experiences as a DS beginner already through the #66DaysofData and now this video is at another level altogether. Thank you once again
Great video...Really liked the bit of 'Balance is being a myth'. I'm also a big believer in not multi-tasking...One thing that I need to focus on is to code more... Also, Killer cameo by your dad
Whiteboards are major keys to success!
These are great tips, Ken. The most important thing I should focus on each day is to read books of Machine Learning.
Missed opportunity to have your dad sport a 66daysofdata shirt! And I was low key hoping to learn how to balance papayas in this video, Ken. :D
Hi Ken ! Thanks for the video :) I've just starting a new job as data scientist officially after a year struggling with the old job. And what a timing! You released this video exactly when I am about to start timelining my 2021 for the projects I will be doing in the new office ! I'm so excited to re-start my data science and bioinformatics journey and I am planning to also write at towardsdatascience.com to share my journey and experiences in science. High hopes for brighter 2021 !

Love from Indonesia :)
I never thought about using the different parts of the brain .. I think that's why I like to cook after a long day of coding and reading empirical literature, I start to feel more energetic as soon as I start cutting. Very motivating and helpful video ! I hope I'll get the chance to meet you one day
How many times did Ken adjust his glasses? LOL
Oh my god, I love Papa Jee
"No papayas were harmed" I guffawed
#20: I wanted to go in order watching the videos, but this one! Oh my! Is great!!! 
The tips, the techniques. You are in the flow, this is going great for you! Again, inspiring!! Thank you for sharing!!
Ps: The guest appearance it‚Äôs lovely! #66daysofdata
That was the best introduction to a video I've seen all month üòÇ

I agree that balance is a myth. I recently started reading "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and it's helping me out a lot with time management!

Highly Recommend It!
Daddy knows best. 

I mean,  you already said he thinks you're soft,  now this? Man's hard to please. ü§£

The one thing? Maybe eliminate distractions so I can focus on learning what I need to in order to develop this skill to an employable level......I don't focus long enough and forget very easily
Great video! Structure does helps with learning.
Class video. Could you make one on the best way to showcase your work (YouTube vs blog vs personal website etc)
I guess it's going to be inculcating the habit to work deeply that'll take me places
Tq for inspiring me to pursue data science even tho i m majoring in networking. Currently using my 1 month sembreak to smash through its microcourses
Fuck ...I'm currently in your #66daysofdata challenge community and I tweeted this exact thing about work life balance in my latest tweet  .....I really wanted some good advice and here I go !
Ken and Papaya>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
GR8!!!
Great video Ken! Great advice on the economies of scope, I'm also trying to balance research, content creation and teaching and it's slowly working and falling into place. The initial phase was quite challenging though when the overlap was not apparent, luckily its starting to work out, thanks for the tip a while back!
12:42 Hey, that's me! üòÜ
This is actually very informative totally agree on planner which I don't follow even If I make I will try to do and you remember ken in live with Andrew you suggested me an book for machine learning I went through it  on Amazon it is expensive after converting it in rupees it became like 2 to 3K  . But anyway love your content as always and appreciate how active you are in this community and helping others‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ

Nowadays it's much harder to keep a balance, especially in countries that impose large restrictions on social interactions.
Some really helpful stuff in there. Besides being easily distracted my biggest problem when planning is overloading days and not being able to do something in the planned time frame.
Thanks, ken for sharing this...It's really very helpful 2 new things I get to know and I have to work most on these two things:  80/20 rule and  Hyper- Prioritization
Very very inspiring!
This is really interesting, and those things might not be a secret, but sometimes you can't think about them on your own, and videos like this help to get you back on track when you need it. 
PS: I plan to learn about Docker today, I think it's exactly what I need right now for a job interview and for my own work in the future.

Learned a lot from this Project, Thanks a lot, Ken.üëç
Top content
Thank you my friend for these insightful tutorials. Could you please recommend a link for dirty datasets that one can exercise cleaning on them?
Hi, ken, 
Can you suggest to me how can I build my profile for a data science masters? What things should I do as I have one year with me?
I will be a great help!
I press like even i'm not finished watching this videoüëç
damn this is boring...no offense mate, I'm sure the learning is great, but I was interested in whta data scientists do, as I'm a just finish law degree and will probably go onto IP/ICT Law masters here in the UK, so was thinking if I could somehow mix it with data and become a data protection solicitor - mostly about GDPR and then the IP with it so like trademarks, copyrights, designs...but now seeing how boring data science is (even for a coder like myself), I wouldn't enjoy doing this. Prolly will switch back to international commercial law xD
This series is gold. Learned a lot ! Thank you for the effort. Hope you gain some new followers. This is what makes you stand out. 
Please, keep on doing these kaggle series. I think this is way more helpful than simple tutorials of how svm works or why you should normalization yout data :). To see the analysis in a real scenario helps for sure.
These videos are awesome! Im sure u can sell them easily.
Awsome Ken.... You really gave so much effort . Love it. Please at the end, could you make an extra video for github uploading as well ? Last time, I got lost on that step. Love it love it :)
I'm surprised that Data Scientists don't recommend SQL, while it's true that you need an analytic like the ones provided by Python or R, SQL is simple and almost as important. 
PS: I didn't want to make a new comment, but I was afraid this opinion would get overlooked if I just edited the old one.
Plot.ly really nice demonstrating questions in the EDA part and presenting dataset constraints
I love this content
Beginner projects needed please... Thank you
These are some very amazing charts and I not used them before so looks like we have something new to look or do üíØüíØ
Brilliant as always! Thank you for the great effort and high quality content.
Super awesome work and such a great beginner series!! It really helps beginners kickstart their own projects üòé
Like first, watch later -> rewatch when needed. Great video as always
Great video Ken! Nice and thorough analysis. üòÜTowards the end of the video, the imbalanced gender classes is roughly 80/20, if we were to convert this to a classification model, would be interesting to apply undersampling or oversampling to create a balanced model that may potentially be used for model interpretation.
How come you are using linear models but did not scale the data? Or did I miss that? Also this gave me a ton of ideas. One would be definitely to do a feature selection after one hot encoding and see if the explained variance improves?
been following this series since part 1 and i can safely say i have an idea of how to build and learn from kaggle projects
Do more please especially for beginner
that's awesome, Ken!
I've never played with plotly before, but I might do it now after watching these project videos.
thanks a lot for all the tips and tricks!

As a person who barely understands anything at all about data science, this video is extremely informative in that you explain your thinking process and methodical approach.
Great video as always. It's great to see someone do it from scratch.
please provide the link of dataset you are using
Thank you for these
Hey Ken, thank you for creating awesome playlists. I have never come across a video with a detailed explanation of how to approach data science problems. And your videos are such a lifesaver!!!
20:06: Dat stats PUN! hahahahaha XD
man...you are a legend..I wanna get into data science..I had loved this field since i was literally 8 years old, I always loved to keep stock of all my stuff, toys, books etc, i started with maintaining a work book on my notebook, even though i barely knew how to write lol, and then i started using MS Access, Loved it so much as a kid, it was mostly DBA than data science though, until I started watching a lot of football, tennis etc, try and analyse the data from each match and started to build etc etc yk how it goes and today about a decade later, I am super interested in the field.. I know basic Python, R, Power BI, MS Analysis services, etc etc, But i wanna know a how to get self taught a good path to follow, hope anyone could point me in the right direction, thank you..
9:28 why do we have to use dict.fromkeys() ?
Yeah plotly is pretty nifty, but I have a hard time understanding the logic of how to do things past the more basic plots because the documentation can be a little lacking when trying to customize something. I did some poker analysis using plotly and can understand the struggle.
Thanks for sharing this, Ken. Looks amazing and that's what I need. When I try to follow ur way to code, I found an easier way to do that in 14:22, which is in "In [12]" (the heatmap part). Actually we can order the data by "df.sort_values(by=['Q1', 'Q6'])" before we plot the heatmap.
This was really helpful. Followed the tutorial to the end and would say plotly is a very nice tool for interactive graphs and plots. Thanks a lot for making this available.
Excellent work Ken! I've never used plotly before, those charts look really great!
Plotly is not showing up in Jupyter lab. Had to do the following:
!pip install plotly==4.14.3
!conda install jupyterlab 'ipywidgets>=7.5' -y
!JupyterLab renderer support
!conda install -c conda-forge nodejs -y
!jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.14.3
This is awesome! I have barely started this journey, but your videos make me confident that I can actually learn and do this :)
Some high-quality content. loved it.
Hi im curious about the code list(dict.fromkeys([i.split('_')[0] for i in df_fin.columns])). Why does for question 7 for example has only one in the list where it has like 12 parts. If you split it should not it be Q7, Q7, Q7, Q7....repeated 12 times. Is it because in dictionary you cannot have duplicated keys?
You are really making a difference by showing the steps and hands on methodology of the work that a dat scientist does!  Thank you!
Great video. I am new Python so its great to see some uses for dictionaries and some of your clever aggregation techniques. I completely relate to the Plotly struggle as I decided R Shiny, rather than Tableau or Power BI, was the the tool for my Masters project in Data Vis. I spent days and days working out the kinks in all my visuals but it came in really useful when I did my dissertation and had to visualise my results. Plotly is painful but powerful.
This is amazing and I thing I am learning a lot with this series and hope make my own end to end project one dayüíØ just waiting for damn ideas to come to my mindüòÇ
Hey, you are a youtuber who involve and interact with audience with great interest and in a very humble way... I am really grateful that I can sometimes ask some doubt to you here... Do you have any telegram group or anything where we can put our queries or discuss about our projects?
Such a great head start for people who are new to Kaggle!! (or even for people who are new to data science for that matter)   Great work Ken!
I NEEDED THISSS!!!
Ken - Really enjoyed this video.  I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome.  Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc.

I can't wait for the logical next iteration of this style of video - livestreaming your work!
Thank you for the training. Am learning how to approach a data set from a data science view. Am two months into learning data science Msc.
Ken , what do you think about Tensorflow?
I use a macbook and have been stuck with issues (modulenotfound and PIL errors) since a week. I've literally followed every single stackoverflow and github issue thread but nothing seems to work. Does tf, in general, doesnt work on MacOS?

This is my error(if anyone's wondering):

!python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x {'/content/Training'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/train.record'}
!python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x{'/content/Testing'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/test.record'}
running which gives me the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/content/generate_tfrecord.py", line 29, in <module>
    from object_detection.utils import dataset_util, label_map_util
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'object_detection'

Maybe you could review some good kernels from beginner to expert level as a finishing video for this series?

Btw here's my novice approach: https://www.kaggle.com/sniggdhaa/why-consider-being-a-db-administrator-engineer üòÅ
Its amazing bro... Its very coolü§óüëèüëè
Legend goes that the model is still training
Awesome stuff! Thanks a ton üòÅ
Very helpful to understand how to approach
I have a python question: why does the line at 8:55 'qnums = list(dict.fromkeys([.....]))' work?  Shouldn't 'dict.fromkeys' only work for tuples not lists?
So for the first 6 questions (not including the country question) I converted the data types to Categorical and set the order I wanted them within that step. It made it so that the plots I made were in in that order without any additional code in the plotting step. Do you think that would cause any issues down the road with other parts of the process?
Thank you very much. Very creative graphs. The most interesting was how you used dictionary for multiple answer questionsüëçüëçüëç
This is really so cool! You have to really collab with Bad Friends. Their pranks hella are like Vitaly mixed with MrBeast! They're an insane group in Cali.

You should totally check out their page out and give the friend group a subscribe! üëâ #SanitizedBadFriends
Hey Ken.

I currently have 60-90 credits from a bachelor's of arts in business from a state University. I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts.

Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role?

Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS? 

Goal is BI/DA --> MLE/DS one day
This is so much valuable for a ‚Äústudent‚Äù. Thanks a lot for sharing your progress and process!!
This was so informative please do more of these series!!
I prefer tableau for this kind of advanced analysis...but still I learned a lot thanks alot ken jee..
put this in today to do list :)
Great job explaining your thought process Ken!  I really like that you work to be as efficient as possible!  Looking forward to the next one!
A like and a comment even before watching the video because whenever I see "From Scratch" in the title of any of your videos, then I know that there is a high quality content waiting for me!
Wow Awesome EDA tutorial Ken!
Thanks for the content. It's really helpful for me. Now, i'm your subscriber.
I watched every ad all the way through. Not sure if that helps your monetization or not, but you out a ton of care into this,you should be rewarded for it. 

This is fanatic.  Thank you
Thanks Ken, to boost my confidence for building my project.
Share your notebook, please
Saved. Will watch and practice first thing tomorrow morning. Thanks Ken!!
Great visualisation Ken üíØüìä
Awesome! That advanced graph is so cool. Should I start learning plotly and stop using matplotlib and seaborn?
yey! I was waiting for this!!! Great stuff Ken! I wish I had your hability to document things step by step
Thanks
It was nice to see the process of visualizing the data. I'm sure I'll come back to this video if I'm dealing with a similar dataset
Looks amazing, Ken. The advanced graph looks great. I will go through the link and work on the Notebook as soon as possible. Will be learning a lot about EDA from here. Thanks for sharing!!
Finally!üòÖ waiting for this for a long time ‚ù§Ô∏è
KEN JEE You will not believe that I am addicted to your channel üòÇüòÇ
Here early today, will be watching this later tonight. Awesome, the epic T-shirt is out üòÜ
Thanks for tuning in everyone! Get ready for part 2 coming 1/8! If you can't wait till then, I recommend checking out these other projects that I've done:

I'm very interested in participating in the Kaggle competition, but I don't know where to start. Then I found your video. Thank you.
Great video Ken , I will code along. I seriously need to learn about APIs.
Love these videos! Would love to see you do more project walkthroughs Ken!
Very good introduction on Kaggle. Truly learning by doing! I like that approach.
Thanks for the vid ! nice ! 
I have a question apart. I did a dual boot windows/Ubuntu. But i want to switch 100% on ubuntu. Is it possible or i may loose my computer doing that ? (BTW do you have any tutorial for that) ?
Awesome! Thanks
This is really comprehensive. All from scratch, that's what i wanted . thanks ken
00:50 "It's nice for me to say that you should learn certain things or do certain things, it means a lot more if I can legitimately back those statements up with data."
Much appreciated.
I wish you'd been creating videos like this when I was learning data science! It would have saved me so much fretting and time.
I've tried using the link that you showed us to download kaggle data sets but I still can't get it to be copied in the .kaggle folder that was made. I'm using Anaconda and am relatively new. Do you have any suggestions?
Really helpful video, mate!
Thank you for providing the steps!
Been back and forth doing project from Kaggle and got stacked because don't know where to start questioning the data, and feeling guilty if I don't produce the questions by my own!

Super cool! Keep it up!
Been a while since I watched your videos been so busy.  Really great work getting to 114k man! I remember when I found your channel you were nearing 30k subs.  Keep making awesome videos!
You probably already know this Ken, but in the terminal I use 'cd Doc' then tab complete.  It saves a few keystrokes for tired hands :D  

I'm excited to watch you complete this series!
I had no idea Kaggle did exploratory competitions! Thank you Ken!
The cli typos are so relatable. I do them all the time. I use some Oh-my-zsh autocomplete extensions but the auto-suggestions can get problematic when I always write pyhton instead of python.
Awsome. I am hooked with this chanel after i watched your Data science project from scratch. Other channel just write the code but Ken actually shows us the process. In the mean time, he gets error and he solved it real time. This kind of video is very helpful. Love it Ken... Please watch these kind of videos :)
Hey Ken Jee I did a bootcamp and my concept are now clear to someextent.
Now I want to skill up my problem solving skill.
How I can do that ?
can you please make a detailed tutorial on how to deploy the model using different methods (can make a playlist)
This is awesome - Really insightful! Looking forward to the next part.
Thanks Ken!

Great video, thanks for sharing! I'm just getting into Kaggle myself, love your approach and narration. One thing I'm curious about is best practices for version control in the local development workflow for Kaggle competitions. Looking forward to your next video!
love this because to this day i can't figure out kaggle lol
Excited that everyone is so excited. Would be happy to follow along in other data tools with this project. I'm sort of a one man band at the moment so time is a constraint, due to this constraint I don't use R/Python as much as I used to instead I use data science tools like Alteryx and viz tools like Power BI/Tableau. Looking forward to follow along and try this out with a different toolset. 
Cheers
Hi thanks for the video just see you change to Linux instead of Windows
how good is it, what are pros and cons of this change?
Streamlit is also a good EDA tool
Thanks! Very nice to be guided through a Kaggle comp. Greeting from Chile.
I love this type of content. Great job :-)
YES!!! I've been waiting for this project series for months!

Let #66DaysofData begin! :)
Great video Ken! This is probably one of the most important video in the series as it sets the stage for the entire data science workflow by implementing the list of questions formulated in this video. Like how you spend time explaining these essential before thoughts before diving into the coding. I haven‚Äôt yet done any Kaggle competition, might have just got inspired by your video üòÜ
this is a very helpful insight. I have seen a lot of videos of yours where you try and take inspiration from the works of others. I think that is how a Community grows!
I love the projects videos
just can't wait for part 2. You're the best YouTuber Ken. Love you, bro.
Thank you Ken! Looking forward to part 2 and part 3
Could we just for a moment appreciate the fact that we are doing data science to actually learn about data science!
Love seeing similarities in how you start thinking about a project. I always find it interesting to see how others think and finding answers to questions through data or even finding ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù questions #DataGeek
Hi Ken, can you please discuss how to structure a Clustering project? I just finished some classification and regression projects but I have no idea what to do for clustering. I can't find many resources online explaining clustering algorithms in a way that makes sense to me.
Hi! Super newb question here for Ken Jee or anyone who cares to weigh in. :) I don't see a "Join Competition" button on this particular comp. Instead, it says to complete the Submission Form in order to participate. Is this normal and why is this happening? (Yes I'm signed in on Kaggle, and I see join buttons on other active comps.)
Thank you for your guide üëè I really appreciate your dedication to what you do üôÇWish you the best!
Just try using Vaex library for your EDA
Amazing start of the year Ken. I was wondering about your masterpiece playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t. Aren't you gonna do a similar full project on a different topic/dataset?
Wow another great video
I think this video will get the highest like because the topic is üî•
I loved this topic  very much make more video on this topic if you can thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I wish that your channel cross 2 lakh subscribers soon üéâ
Yess ...this is amazing and will make us understand how kaggle works and how to get start with a data set üíØüíØ
you are the greatest!!!
Looking forward to work on this. Thanks! Ken
This is exciting.  I like seeing that I had the same questions myself as a real,  hardened, battle tested data scientist.
Great first video back! I started my 66 days for 2021. Im excited to see what I will be able to do by the end.
Excited to complete this analysis along with you.
I loved the data science from scratch series. I also got started with kaggle recently. Thanks a lot for these vids
I'm starting my first kaggle project, so this will come handy! Thanks Ken!
I love you Ken.
Good luck, looking forward for your videos and the 66daysofData challenge. I already made 2 Projects and first video is going to be up on my channel tomorrow. Together we are strong :-).
Will you do a full tutorial on this? I think this project might be even a bit easier than titanic.
I will start doing this for #66daysofdata challenge version 2.. Thanks for posting üôÇ
Thank you, happy new year!
Thank you so much!
I can't wait to see part 2... good job for making these videos for us
will do this part of 66Days challenge :D
Question: do you have to use D3.js in your daily work?
I love how you just don't edit your mistakes out. It just shows that even the bests do silly things sometimes! You're inspiring Ken ‚ô•Ô∏è
I am going to start master's data science course in coming September, in Cardiff University.  I think it has good modules at a decent fee. Do you think my decision is correct? Because there is still time left to amend the decision.
Yayyy something new and interesting just before I start my grad school!!!
First one!
Hey, Thank you for sharing amazing content with us. It's really helpful.
Hey Hey, Its been a while..Back with something great
Thanks for tuning in everyone! I hope you will join me for the challenge!

Day 3!! Loving it so far!
Am just starting my data science journey, this will get me to learn daily before my masters begins in June 2022.
Very insightful video. Thank you for starting something so helpful. One question though, is this limited to just Data Scientists? Can other data professionals E.g Analytics Engineers and Data Analysts, join?
Thanks Ken for the video; I'm really thrilled to get started on this adventure, and thanks for providing such an excellent starting point üî•
This is awesome! Excited to start!
Are you starting again this January? :D I just got to know about this initiative and I am going to start today :D
Hi Ken,
I'm Blaise one of your follower in youtube. All your Video are so many helpfull. My company facing now with inventory problem. I'm wondering if I can implement Object detection tracking/ counting to Increase the speed and the Accuracy of Inventory?  Could you give some advise about?
Thank you
I came here from Tina's channel. I am just seeing this video now that I am about starting on my data science path. Anyway, my 66 days starts now
I just started my career in data governance. Whats the best resource  to start my 66 days of data challenge??
Thanks for this video, Ken. Found you through Tina Huang. Definitely joining the 66 day challenge. Just started the Google Data Analytics Course. Watching from Australia. üòÉüëçüëçüëç
As a last year student at a master's degree in Data Science, i can absolutely confirm that it is actually hard to keep up the momentum and specially remembering all the things you have learned so far, since there are tons of things!!
think this is a good idea.
I'm doing this definitely
Hey Ken, I actually started my data science journey a while ago and I'm kinda 10% into it, still I'm gonna start my journey as Day1 so that it keeps me motivated !!!!. Tbh sometimes I really kept skipping a day in between or so, but I hope it changes and I stay focused and motivated. Thanks for starting this initiative ‚ù§
Thank you.
This video gives me courage to study data science.
@ken you become like my big broda pushing me to take initiatives on my work still in my 19!
That T-shirt is amazing
Your videos are awesome, whenever I am frustrated and feel low about my data science learning, I watch your videos and BOOM i am all set to  go again. Appreciate your efforts üëç
Hey I tried joining your discord link it says invalid or expired... too late?
I'm starting today let's do this shit
Thank you so much for this.  It is exactly what I needed.  I am in the PG Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Texas and it is so hard to get momentum and I need that accountability.  I am going to join the discord and start posting there and on my LinkedIn.  I am looking forward to the challenge!  #66DaysofData #HookEmHorns
Thank you Ken Jee.
I‚Äôm on day 10. The hardest part so far is being patient! I just want to be able to learn everything at once and start a new career path in this field!! I wish I would‚Äôve found this 13 years ago but at 31 I feel like I still have enough time to make a fun, and rewarding career out of this!! Channels like this are really helping me immerse myself in all things data science related right now so I can absorb everything I can!
Great challenge Ken. Thank you.
hmmm i am noticing a pattern here . most data science youtubers are asian.the most popular being joma tech
I‚Äôm late but I‚Äôm so hungry to learn and get a b!etter career
hindi me seekhein data science https://youtu.be/chGxRprd5SI
*Roadmap to learn data science from scratch?*
Hey ken 
I am an student and I know basics of Computer and some language like C, Java, Python and some what web development 
Should I start learning Data Science or learn more in depth about languages??
I'm doing my  #365DaysOfData studying every day with my community!  Every time we can talk about something we are studying we expose what we learned in the community. If you want to grow with us, collaborate when you want, and study together reach us at machine learning milan together on https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Machine-Learning-Together-Milan. We really want to grow together :)
Tomorrow we begin!
Awesome initiative. We are birthday mates and I'll be starting on the 4th of January as well.
Yay! Will finally get to join this round. üí™
Hello Ken,
Is it recommend to code all the machine learning algorithms from scratch so that I can learn math behind it or just understand and start to code?
Yes finally starting with everyone but from today. Excited!! Jan 01 2021.
I am looking forward to it. I am little confused about how Big Data and Data Science are related. Is Data Science for Big Data different than normal Data Science?
Hi Ken, thanks always for these awesome videos. I'm a working professional wanting to break into the data science field. I can quite comfortably use machine learning Python libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn, etc) and have done some projects on my own. But after trying some coding interview questions on prep sites (Algoexpert, LeetCode), I feel a bit defeated. I want to hear from you if those coding interview questions are designed specifically to test software engineer candidates and what level of expertise in programming is required/expected from data analyst/scientist candidates vs. software engineers?
Very excited
I don't do any social media but I'll definitely give this a shot!
Cool! I didn‚Äôt do the first one, but excited to start this one too.

Will be a great way to reestablish all the fundamentals and build a project!
Looking forward to Round 2 after the Holidays
where should i start if i want to start from the basics?
I will do 66 days data science and losing weight together lol
Has it to be some advanced concepts in machine learning or we can begin with some basic libraries as well and continue it up for next 66 days? As I am a beginner in the field of data science?
even 5 minutes a day can be a struggle for people like me :( But I will give it a try!
That's interesting! Can someone who is only starting in DS field join?
Honestly speaking when you introduced this challenge for the first time..I was not able to cope up..but this time I'll make sure to keep it up. #66DaysOfData challenge

Can't wait to get started üòÅ
I was originally going to do a sustained period of learning until I land a job opportunity and probably even after that. I am definitely joining. Is it not for people learning data analytics in particular though?
I gonna start again to keep 66 days streak! this time, joined discord community too :)
So great to have Tina and Andrew along! Can‚Äôt wait to start again
Y did u move to hawaii do u like it there?  Are u asian?
I think I'll start the same day as you, it would be fitting to offer you a hashtag as birthday present. Really looking forward to this, I missed the start of it last year. Good luck everyone.
hey ken I want to learn data science with you but I m a bit confused about how exactly this works. will you give us a task every day or we need to take the task by ourselves? it would be a great help if you put some insight on this.
I cannot join the discord
Starting a new job as Data Scientist on 4th of january. Looks like a good challenge to review what I have learned and hammer it into my mind to hopefully not to get fired :-D.
I'm doing #66DaysofWebDev
Happy holidays Ken ! So if someone wanted to give you a present on New Year's Eve, he's expected to give another one four days later :3 Has this ever happened to u Hahah ?
Nice, Ken!
Let's go!
@ken Jee, Signed up and starting mine on Tuesday!
Excited to be a part of this, Ken! Let's GET THIS BREAD
For anyone looking for courses I HIGHLY recommend the University of Michigan's applied data science course. Would work great in tandem with the 66 days of data if you want to do both. I recently finished the third course in the curriculum.
Joining this time! I'll be learning SQL through datacamp
Didn't know we shared the same birthday!! üòÄüòÄ
Waiting for 4jan.
Can't wait to get my first 6 months internship so i could write a huge linkedin post to thank you and show my appreciation for how much i learned from you !
Can't wait for itttttt
You are just awesome... I hv no world more then this...  So informative and not posting anything   nonsense only bcos its trending.. You always post watever informative for ds ai ml aspirants... üòç i am loving it..  Thanks for all information.. üôè
Looking forward to joining you on Jan 4. I'm going to focus on GPU accelerated algorithms. I'd love to be considered for some of your Nvidia credits. I think between now and the 4th I am going to outline my curriculum so that I know where I am headed instead of spending a lot of time each day pondering "what's next." I'm also going to post on LinkedIn and upload all of my notebooks to GitHub. There - I'm publicly committed. #66DaysofData
I am starting today.. #66daysofdata
I can't wait to get started after the new year
If I can just start off doing one Pomodoro session on 1st of Jan and build on it from there, I will be happy. However, I might lose focus with off days.
Thank you for this again, Ken. Looking forward to everybody's second run (and hopefully many first runs). Here's to learning from the first 66 days to make the second 66 days even better. :)
Hey ken Jee, this question may be off topic..
But as a beginner in machine learning (scikit-learn) which book is best?
Yayyy 
This is an awesome idea and it helped me alot!!!
Looking forward to do doing it again with you Ken !
Great Ken! I will try my best to again participate in #66daysofdata...really excited to share another exciting journey exclusively on Twitter...üòÖüôÇ
This is going to be exciting while working on a PhD
maybe I missed some announcement
when is the merch released?
Also I didnt shared my project etc but I followed the #66daysofdata for 96 days now and it helped me to keep going.
So thank you so much Ken üòäüëç
Ps. Happy Birthday in Advance Kenüòé
Here we go again!!!!!!!!! And this time I will be able to start with everyone! Let's go! :D
Another awesome video. Actually, I was waiting. I can see that your are excited about the next Journey, Ken. I am also joining with full energy again as I will be continuing with my same learning Journey. Let's do this !!
Really enjoyed this challenge. I followed it on LinkedIn especially and Boris Giba was an absolute beast, crazy motivational. I‚Äôll join in and try to be atleast as productive as he was
This is awesome the progress #66daysofdata made and I personally made an twitter account which I didn't have to before just to start 66daysofdata and also in advance happy birthday üíØ
Ps: I have messaged you in linkdin about linkdin data dashboard üòä
Very happy üòçüíã üíùüíñ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much for the knowledge and the wisdom, you share with us ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I am on Day 66 of my first iteration today :) Gonna start it up again in the new year together with everyone!
Thanks
@Ken Jee¬† what are the topics for Stats amd maths that are just enough to get started?
Thank you very much for your explanation. I think it can be helpful to have groups of 3 to 5 persons in which you can work together on projects.  In this way, you can learn from others and have the motivation
I recently started following you. I am terrible at Stat. I have this fear. But with this I am ready to face it heads-on. Thank you for speaking to me. I will start my Journey today
can u help me by tell me what is the most important model/topic in machine learning do I have to learn for data science ?
what are some sources to learn stats and algorithims?
Has anyone looked at the MS in Data Science from Eastern University? I was looking into it but I'm not sure about its quality. Any feedback is appreciated.
Normal people: "Frustration"
Me, as a soft. Engineer: "Routine"
Im doing data analytics at university, but I just hate the structure and stress of school, is it genuinely fine to learn data science by myself or should I stick to it?
I am very interested in starting a new career in Data Science in Healthcare and was planning to start my learning journey with 365Data Science, Kaggle, or Dataquest. I have a couple of questions: (i) I have a Healthcare business background and was wondering as to which of the three learning platforms mentioned above would be most suitable for me? (ii) You mentioned a set of projects that every person should complete. However,  which are the projects I should work on in Healthcare to make myself more marketable and where and how can I access these projects?
Hey what are your thoughts on getting an MBA in Data Science and Analytics. Background: Freelanced in Digital Analytics for a year and pursuing Google Data Analysis specialisation from Coursera.
i failed stat 1 x3 in college (im english major, now doing sales). now Im relearning stat for data science
Just wanted to jump in and thank you! There is something I learnt a while ago that you will never know if you really want something until you do it. Until this video I had no idea we didn't need to go to university to dip our toes into the field.
Haha Ken! Min 1:45. My global max favourite of this  video. Great channel - GL on all your goals!
Between IBM Data Science on Coursera and 365 Data Science, which should I take for Data Science? Please I'm confused
u look like kun aguero
Hi Guys, 

Is anybody read the stats book suggested by Ken: Practical Stats using R and Python?

I am at chapter 3 but
intermediate level of Python now and will be ready to go through projects and do projects of my own soon after grasping the basics of stats for Data Science.

Let me know please and best of luck everybody.
This is the Data since as this video after 5-6 months later , you will see your self again wtf was talking about lol . 
Thanks for videos really appreciate ATM . Good job . thanks again
Hello Ken ! I'm starting this journey to become a Data Scientist, I already learned how to program and I'm ready for my next step which is getting familiar with statistics and algorithms and I have a question to make:

Do I need to learn different programming languages to become a Data Scientist ? I learned Python and some  Ruby, should I take my time and learn R?
Such an informative video Ken.
Can you make a video on Roadmap to Learn Data Science in 2021,
It will be really helpful for freshers like me.
Hi ken,
I have been wanting to get in the field for some time....have been a working professional in IT for two years
But everything seems so vast that it scares to even begin.....any advice ?
I'm 47 and back in school  for a career change. I'm about a year away from a BS in Data Analytics. With my age, I feel like I need to REALLY learn this stuff faster and better than my peers because I'm already 'behind'. I haven't learned all the concepts, but I do know R, python  and basic stats including regression, logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. I love data science, even though I don't understand it all yet. Anyone have other  youtubers that I can follow, in addition to Ken. I'm not worried about not understanding everything yet, I just want to expose myself to the topics. I know at some point, it will come together and "click"
Should I learn algorithms and OOPs in Python before moving on to the next step?
1) learn programming(python) 
2) get familiar with stats and algorithms
3) code review(go to kaggle) 
4) do as many projects as you can now
Note: these need not to be done in sequence and don't try to master them, get a basic understanding and make learning a habit
Last thing: engage with community
I am still in the learning stage. These are my core learning areas:
* Stats
* Computer tools - R, Python, SQL
What else?
Hi Ken, do you have any advice on reviewing kaggle code? Are there any kaggle competitions in particular that I should look for notebooks in that would be easy to learn from for beginners?
You don‚Äôt recommend attending university?
Hi Ken, I am new gradudate in cs major, I did some research then I decide to join the data science industry as you do. However, I don't have much work experice. In order to land a job in data science maybe just intern, should I do some persoanl projets or go get some certificates such as Google Data Analytics Specialization on coursera. I am kinda strong in math and algorithm, while lack of experience. Thanks !
Another Awesome video!
Dude. I really appreciate your content. 

I‚Äôm busy pushing thru Udacity‚Äôs machine Learning course. I work alone and no one I speak too understands what I‚Äôm going through. 

Udacity content really bugs me. Pun intended. 

You‚Äôre describing exactly what‚Äôs happening and I find it very therapeutic. I‚Äôm not stupid
Time for another 66 days??
Any guidance anyone needs is here. Follow his channel and do whatever he says and TADA you are a data scientist.
Just signed up for data scientist training.  After being a psychology professor, science teacher for over 20 years, I am super stoked to figure out how to build neuronets.  Is this actually a viable field?
to become a data scientist, what program or application do I need to start learning?
6:12 Data humor ü§îüòÇ
heyy ,
 where can I find projects to learn ?
I'm definitely struggling with imposter syndrome right now but this video helped me feel confident in the fact that I DO know things and have skills. Thanks!
I just got invited to CorrelationOne Data Science for All from my work for free. Its gonna take 13 Saturdays im my life.... should I do it?
Hi I am a back-end software engineer, mostly use nodejs. Can i become a data Scientists?
Hi Ken Jee, Do data science industry require any degree or diploma, so that we get shortlist easily on that basis ??
Thank you Ken. I‚Äôm starting from scratch. So I have no clue of what steps to take. I find myself getting overwhelmed trying out different things simply because of this. Do you mind sharing a link to a curriculum? It would help so much to keep on track, set goals and move at a good pace.
That's smooth sliding your request for the audience to like and subscribe with joining communities...
Hey Ken!
I have been learning data science for the last year. and I have one problem which I often face and can't find the answer to. which learning an algorithm, we get the logic behind it. we learn the intuition behind the algorithm. but while doing a project, and actually applying those algorithms, we see a lot of parameters, literally 20-50 parameters. and I personally don't get the intuition behind all those parameters. looking at those parameters makes it more complex. when I search on the internet, it says that "usually we use this value for this parameters ". but can't find the reason. 
Also, while learning deep learning, it's too difficult to find an answer to my doubt. 
I hope you got what my problem is... let me know your view on it.
Also, I love your content. :D
Es super buena onda Ken (this guy is cool)
Which Project?: I am currently working on Martingale project, basically taking Monte Carlo simulation approach to determine how well the Martingale Roulette betting strategy works. Can you tell me what you think about this project?
Thanks for this video, I needed to hear this. I‚Äôm a sucker for staying in the shallow end trying to master the theory of a new topic and feeling ‚Äúready‚Äù before jumping into projects. I‚Äôm setting myself the goal of completing one of each data science project by the end of this year.
Thank you for this video, i am at the stuck phase, where i feel like i don't know anything. Its like the more i know, the things i don't know keep expanding. My python and machine learning skills are pretty intermediate. Although one thing i have avoided for a long time is working on projects. I will start doing that.
Thank you for this video, i am at the stuck phase, where i feel like i don't know anything. Its like the more i know, the things i don't know keep expanding.

I'll work in a league of legends data analysis tool. I don't know where tho start. But I'll start this year
The best thing you mentioned is If you don't like hearing me speak there is no reason to buy my course. Actually, this occurs many times.
But In your case, I like to hear you because of your way to explain concepts.
I'm a materials engineer and I have data like xray and electron beam diffraction patterns. I would love to create a tool to automate the analysis somewhat easily since manual calculations and sometimes even the softwares available dont work with every single chemistry out there. But right now, I only know basic python programming. Theres adequate literature out there who have done kinda similar stuff but right now, everything is so overwhelming!
The video is awesome, I made a bunch of notes for my self  as a beginner in ds learning. The vide helped me a lot and gave clarity on how to learn step by step. 
But I was surprisingly amazed scrolling down the comment section and seeing author`s replays to almost every comment, this level of interaction with subscribers deserves more subscription and followings!))) I subscribed to the channel and look forward to new videos! 
Great job!
Thanks for the redux! Like a good data scientist, always refining !
From Today I'm started to learn data science?

One o=que::::  How to practice coding example more?
Hi, please can I have your whatsapp number, so we can talk business please
Deep learning project on tea leaf disease detection in tensorflow , training in AWS sagemaker , and deployed using fastapi to get the api and deploy the model in AWS EC2 instance üòé
Do you guys recommend any math?
thank you for this
Hii I'm from india is data science /scientists is best option for future
How do we use kaggle to practice? From what I saw it was just numerous sets of dats that we can use but how do we even go about using it?
I worked on a project of Stock Prediction using Lasso Regression by using Technical Analysis and Time Lag.
Your videos are very educational and they.You have just described how I normally fell when i get stressed if something doesn't work.I wana do my Masters Degree in Data Science ,can you help me please,be my mentor
Great video, very informative!
Im currently planning to brush up/ relearn the foundations of data science such as linear algebra, stas and  calculus so that i fully understand ML and NN. Which do you think I should get started with, or focus more (given that i almost forget most of it ) Thanks!
Hey, Ken. Great video and thanks a lot for sharing! I currently have a bachelor's in accounting and been thinking of going back to uni to get a degree in computer science. Would you recommend this or just stick to (free) online resources eg. Kaggle? Or both?
I strongly agreed that university curriculum is a good reference for study guideline. I personally use the CMU ML program's curriculum and search related python, R or Java related projects to practice at the same time. Very decent and practical advices for data learning. Looking forward to see your next video about this. Finally, my personal advise is do not be too greedy and take time to digest fully. Thanks for sharing!
hey, I'm 15 years old and planning to do data science with 0 knowledge in programming, what courses would you advice I include for grade 11 and 12? thanks!
what advice would you give to a 16 year old thats still in highschool and already knows several programming languages
rewrite the code. take notes on what you don't understand. I do this a lot and it helps me a lot!
If you are looking to land a job in data science, understanding the business matter is first.
You are a great speaker and presenter, do never doubt about it, ever again. Don‚Äôt even mention it
I would love to do spatial analysis. Don't know how yet, but want it too much.
Liked and shared
It may also be useful to take time learning data mining and web scraping. I actually love designing projects on topics that I'm interested in and data mining allows you to create your own datasets.
Hey what you think about the tool ‚Äú Orange‚Äù for data mining  or Rapid miner. What free tool other than coding can I use?
Predict 2021 Tour de France winner
Hey Ken! I'm currently a high school senior and I plan on majoring in data science in college. I've taken all the required math along with calc ab and currently im taking stats. Should I focus more on math or should I learn to code?
I'm really behind in Math and have only done maths up to high school algebra. Is it still possible to learn programming/statistics and data science?. I thinking of teaching myself maths but don't know which topic/s to focus on.
Hi everyone, I hope you can give me some advice. I've been offered a place at Uni to study a Masters Applied AI and Data Science. This would cost ¬£6,768 in tuition as I have an Alumni discount. The curriculum is:
Trimester one:
 Programming for Problem Solving
Introduction to AI
Trimester two:
Data Analytics and Visualisation
Applied AI in Business
Trimester three:
Dissertation Project
My question is, would it be better to build my own curriculum through Coursera or take the Data 365 course? We are in our 3rd lockdown here in the UK and I have a 3 year old son, so trying to figure out what is the best (and most cost effective!) way to learn. Thank you if you have read this far!
hello, I'm Jr Data Scientist, thanks for this video, it's very good
Do you think it's somewhere you can get without college?
You're 100% correct, this is exactly my progress and I've done project in classification, clustering and regression, posted it on my GitHub profile üëçüèΩ
In my country a prestigious uni has created the Data Science(undergraduate) career. Do you think that this path is worth it? The curricular courses are pretty interesting. But I don't know.
I am enjoying your funny clips in between the serious talks. Also, I resonate with using multiple resources to understand a particular topic. Earlier, I used to give up on a certain topic if I didn't understand it in the first go. Now, I take breaks and go back to it using multiple resources. As usual thanks for your awesome advice and your videos are getting more and more entertaining.
is it good option to learn statistics before python ??
2:49 is that your parents?
Last year, I worked on a data science certificate. I learned a lot. However, the program didn't talk about portfolios or branding. It's funny because the training was funded for underemployed individuals..to help them transition to a new career. ALSO, it had 0 programming. I happen to know coding, but I've done no programming projects in this program. 
My first step for 2021 is to learn if I can actually be attractive to employers with this learning (Tableau, RapidMiner, KNIME, Alteryx) and to find a source of temporary income, while I figure this out.
Hi. Do you do one to one consults?
What about SQL do you think it is very important to have an extant skills on it?
üòÅ
Thank you Ken! You're a source of inspiration! 
Can I ask you just one thing: In your opinion is better to improve machine learning knowledge first and after move on deep learning, or study them together?
Thanks for the encouragement Ken Jee ‚Äî great channel. 

Last year, I took your advice and have been learning data science pragmatically mainly through projects/challenges in Kaggle. 
I‚Äôm also enrolling in UT Austin‚Äôs new MS program starting this year. Looking forward to the continual learning process!
great content man! what masters would you choose to pursue in data science? would you say machine learning?
How to join the 365 learning community you mentioned?
Ken, glad to see that you reworked this video. I‚Äôve studied a bit of DS over the past year, but am looking to refocus that effort, so this comes at a great time for me. Also, I saw what you did there with fashion sense...wearing the same shirt.  ü§´
I am a Pharma professional, started learning Python and DS. And obviously looking for healthcare projects. I want to use my healthcare knowledge along with predictive analysis.
My 2021 project will be creating a website which takes individuals WhatsApp permission and then give their WhatsApp group's stats(Like who texts alot, etc) in different charts.

Sir...in data science is the best language ?
How to start the career in data science 
Please tell me
I am a 2 years for cse
I know only python,java language
Hi Ken. I just opened up my course work for my master's program in Data Science from the University of Denver and I am on red alert! The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master's program and switch to a different one.
I'm interested in shifting my career to "Data Science" & I need an advice from an expert in the field after watching good amount of your Youtube videos.


I moved to Illinois, Chicago 7 months ago from Jordan. I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing.

Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and  I came across "Eastern University" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office.

I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered.

My Question:
If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own)
- Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills?
- Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job?
- What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum?

Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion.

Thank you & Happy Holidays
Thank you so much Ken Jee! I am thinking about transitioning into the Data science space in 2021. I am currently in a master of economics and computer science and wanted to know if or how economics helped in your journey into moving into data science as well. Thanks again for this video!!!
"So the first thing that I'd change... would be to start with a plan this time."

... Yup. :/

I need to finish refining my powerlifting EDA project in Python, then use the same dataset for Tableau visualizations. I may go back to the Python project after that to add a regression model or something.

Definitely need to flesh out the plan by the end of the week though. I feel I've made noticeable progress but not as much as I could've made with more planning.
Love the project-driving approach! Thanks for making this amazing video!
Hello Ken!! First of all congratulations for your youtube channel and thank you for this video. I would like to ask your opinion about a 24 months Data Science Masters(Colorado Boulder). I am coming from a non programming/ maths field however I am interested in Data Science. You think that I will be able to prepare  myself in 5 months for this program?
well, what's the difference between data scientist and machine learning engineer or researcher?
Hello Ken, I have a MSc in statistics and would like to move into data science. I recently did a 3 months bootcamp in data science in Paris but the courses were not very good and were not enough in-depthed. I am thinking about doing a master in that field. What do you think would be better suited for me, to do a master in data science, computer science with AI specialization or a master in artificial intelligence? I will probably do it online and I don't want to make any mistake in the master I will choose given the financial cost. 
Thanks for your help.
I'm just about to submit my PhD thesis in Biophysics. I'm hoping to switch to a Bioinformatics career in 2021 so videos like this are super helpful, thanks. Currently working on a project to gather data from various biological databases to help me understand REST APIs.
Which level of programming should I attain to be data scientist? 
¬øDo I need to be expert in coding / programing?
Hi Ken! Could you please check your LinkedIn Messages. Thank you in advance
"Data science" is a code word for "What every Japanese high-school student learns in school."
A "data scientist" is a 21st-century white-collar drudge.
Your videos have inspired many
Thanks ken for this video. 

For your video and other videos I have taken lots of advice. 
Because of you I have 4 projects [ News classification with a dash board, Twitter sentiment analysis, Real Or not NLP project] and some other analysis, cleaning and visualization. I also have learned some machine learning algos from scratch. 

I will make a clustering project soon. 
I am starting to apply for data science jobs. 
I hope to get one of them before january ends. 


If you think there is something more I need to add on my resume. 
Plss mentions. 
Thanks and take care.
I intend on studying hard to acquire strong coding skills (SQL, Python, and R) and becoming an entry level data analyst by the first half of 2021. Can? I sure hope so.
Hello Ken, this isn‚Äôt really related to this video but I was wondering how much your college GPA matters to getting your first data science job or internship? Could having done your own projects or having a good amount of work experience help offset a lower GPA? I would love some input from a person who is actually in the field.
I started my journey in this world this year with a six-month paid course and although I'm very happy with my initial progression, I'm also a bit nervous about the amount of new information I'll have to learn. But seeing your videos help me to calm down and give me more motivation to continue this journey. So thank you Ken!  Greetings from Argentina!
I find the third point extremely helpful: rewriting codes and taking notes of lines you don't understand yet. That would help tremendously. I've been keen on ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù other people's codes but it didn't appear I could do it this way. Thanks!
at least under armour is a good fashion sense. lol
Thanks for sharing
Thanks for your insights! I'm learning to be a data analyst, but DS will be the next step for sure. Cheers ‚úå
Hi, Ken great video....good track which we can follow as a beginner.......Can you plz help how I can entery into sports domain as data scientist or analyst
Merry Christmas Ken :)
Can't wait for next year's 66 days of data!
Great video!

How to join 66 days of data science
Hi, Ken! I really appreciate the content you post, you have been really helpful, thank you a lot!

I've been learning Python for DS for 6 months now using Youtube tutorials and most recently DataCamp. I already have good statistics background and will be taking soon a nice statistics course on Udacity. I think it is a good moment to get my hands dirty with projects, but I've had a hard time finding some. Where do I get DS projects for beginners?
Hi Ken! I just noticed that the annual subscription to 365datascience with 47% off require a promotional code or the link is not working properly. Do you have that code?
Your fashion sense is excellent :)
I come from watching that other video just to listen how you downgrade it ü§£
Definitely looking forward to the next project series Ken!
Took me a while to write the comment, sorry. I've been busy with Christmas preparations (sending virtual Polish Christmas pierogi to Hawaii ;) ). 

My new year's resolutions are a bit similar - I want to get more engaged in communities and find new friends. Also - maybe eventually appear on your YT Channel as a successful transition to DS story ;) 

I have many ideas for DS projects, but they all need some more research (some including IP & compliance research - hey, I used to work as something like a ISO/FDA compliance officer for a while, I kinda like this stuff? I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021. Engineers that are willing to get involved with those topics are rare, so familiarity with such issues can be very valuable to employer... it is just an idea at this point, no decisions have been made). 

I also need to take some deep dive on deep learning and some machine learning algorithms. I ABSOLUTELY need to browse & learn from other people's DS projects more. It's very inspiring too ;)

I am looking forward to the new 66 Days of Data (why 66? why not 69? ;) or any other number?)
1) Start with a plan. That's what I need to do now. I've been jumping around too much. I was interviewing for a couple of months with one company and had a few coding tests that inspired me to focus on those subjects. Then I got the form letter of doom. Now I need to look at what I want to do and refocus. Thanks for the inspiration and the motivation.
In 66 days, iLL be a great DS and a working in a big company in korea
Hi, Ken, I'm looking forward to 66 days! I'm still working on my Titanic competition. The previous modelling performance was only slightly better than the benchmark and then I started all over and found a few things missing from my previous work (combine the datasets first, check the types of missingness, deep understanding of each variable, etc.). So far I made three sharing notebooks(EDA, missingness, fare analysis).  Through this project, I became more aware of the importance of EDA and feature engineering.
Actually I don‚Äôt understand the #66days of data, do we share our progression like everyday but each one on his own or what? If there‚Äôs a video like describing it more then can anyone refer it to me.
Also, I really like how you talk about overcoming the comfort zone or the fear of digging into projects cause yeah it‚Äôs very true.
What an amazing initiative Ken - #66daysofdata is an absolute success!!!
keep it up Ken!  Love it!

Communities are highly important for accountability, relationship/networking as well as finding continual inspiration and perspective from other people at different levels of data science. I highly agree.
Hi jee, I like your videos but don't think it's a good idea to put a strange picture as a cover of a video ...
Hi Ken Jee nice video.. valuable contents!.Do you think it's a good choice to go for a 10months online master in Data science?
Hey! I am thinking about creating a project about a mobile price predictor(which would be  my first project), and I would be following your building a project from scratch playlist. That's my project plan for 2021. Hope everything goes well(fingers crossed).
Thanks, Ken.  Good stuff.
Thank you so much for this insightful video. Is that discord channel open to everyone?
Thank you master‚ô•Ô∏è
Is the Tensorflow Developer Certificate worth it?
Looking forward to another #66DaysOfData
Ken Jee, you are the best. I am your  follower since  this channel has 3k to 4k subscribers. I am happy that your channel is growing.
Part to learn and classify plants in my own garden.
Hey KeNN! Much better fashion sense in this video (and camera, microphone and monitor) :)

I really have been absorbing and enjoying your videos for the past 3 months. Having a physics background and a secret fear of programming, your clear philosophical approach has been a lifesaver. 
I thoroughly enjoy the weekly interviews on KNN and the separate, visual content your youtube channel has to offer. It's so cool to track your growth!

I have a masters in applied physics and am currently trying to land my first full-time data science gig, so I will be sure to add regression & classification projects to my github (Only have Monte Carlo & Clustering projects right now)

Can't wait to see where your punny dad jokes go next!
great tips!!!
I appreciated your video Ken! 2020 was a challenging year for me in terms of defining what to study and you helped me a lot on this! I am looking forward to starting the path I idealized and being part of your community!
Great advice and content Ken! One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as "BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc", especially if you are entry level for several reasons  1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen "data scientists" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2)  If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward.  and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing "cool" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use.  Here‚Äôs to a great 2021!
Ken being honest about what he struggled with, shows that every great data scientist struggled to reach where they are today.  motivating and inspirational as always , thank you !
Was a Data Science Kamehameha in the thumbnail?!
I appreciate this video a lot!  I'm a teenager and brand new to data science but I wanted to use your advice as a springboard to getting into it.  I already bought a few of the books you recommended and I'm slowly on my way.
Thank you Ken. I'm really enjoying your videos and podcast as I begin my data science journey.
I basically never comment on videos on youtube, but I feel like I should do this now as I kinda like what I see and hear. The information seems to be very useful,  thank you.

I am a complete beginner, I started to learn data science a couple of months ago, 5 minutes ago I finished to review some EDA (it is a part of my course). At this moment everything seems to be so complex, I feel like I learn things really slow and I will never be good at this stuff, I hope I am wrong :)

You asked about projects, in the future I'd like to make some prediction model for an esport game like Dota 2, CS:GO or so, if I make some of this in 2021 I'll be sooo happy :D

p.s. pardon me my English, it's not my native language
I think a cool project I want to work on in 2021 is simulating a monopoly game. A favorite subject of mine is stochastic processes, and really, monopoly is just a giant markov chain/transition matrix. I think it'd be cool to do something like that. Still working on my main school project now which has caused a few others to be put on the back burner, but hopefully this one wraps up soon so I can focus on the others more. Great content as always. Just joined the discord!
You and andrew are the only YouTubers who reply to every comment dude just always be like you are now humble üî•
I have been away for a while.. Good to see your channel doing so well. 
Although I haven't been so active recently, I personally have come a long way since the first #66daysofdata. I was looking forward to the next one, but unfortunately I don't think I will be able to participate (I kinda got to be away for quite some time). I will make sure to be on Discord whenever I can though.
Good luck!
Looking forward to join you in the 66 days of data again. As a project, i want to web scrap the prices and data of a colombian e-commerce each day and show how the business behave as the country get the COVID's vaccine.
You are literally amazing. your aesthetic presentation boost me on next level in the quest of learning data science.
Man you really don't need to jump from room to room to shoot, it's distracting and ruins the consistency of the audio
I would like if you do some videos on your 66 days of Data Science Journey as it will give us some insights on how and what to do when we think we might or know that we are lacking something
2021 will be a great year to strengthen my data science skills. I'm planning to do it in ultralearning way.
Where can I find the discord server of 66 days of data science?
I scrolled through all of the comments and I see that you replied to almost all of them. This is extraordinary! Keep up the good work! And thanks for daily motivation. I'm hoping to get a data science job soon.
I have started my  journey to Python and  Data Science.  I have taken a course  from Edx (Python for research) and ML course for my üíØdayscodechallege for 2021. I'm very motivated by your recent LEADERBOARD project for YouTube. I would love to build projects like that.
Hi! I am 16 right now and I got really interested in data science. Right now I am looking for a book or a lecture, which could help me to increase my Maths/programming knowledge. If there is something you can recommend me, I would be really gratefulüôÇ
I already know Python, so maybe there is something else to learn deeper for me
Sir python for datascience learn on youtube or online free course
This video motivated me to start learning again , Thanks Ken ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Ken, this is another stick on the ground. üí°üí°üí°üí°üí°
Taking a crap on the toilet while making youtube videos about data science = boss level
Hey, I'm a first year Undergraduate Data Science student. I'm having a little trouble keeping up with all my colleagues that have already learned to program during their school years. (We had a choice between computers and biology, I was a bio student) Any tips?
Thanks for watching everyone! Would love to hear about the projects you are planning to do in 2021 below!

you said and i agree :first start with learn programming
at what point do u stop and say ok i ''''know''''' programming ?
so for me i decided that when i am able to solve 6 kyu question on codewars and easy questions on leetcode without any problem and only then can i say without feeling that i lie that kind of know enough python to go on
granted it takes a lot of time and pain but im pretty sure it will be worth it because then i can be sure that comes hell or high water i will never have a problem that is caused bcoz of insufficient knowledge in programming 
anybody here share my viewpoint?
am i too much?to little?
Love it. Thanks ü§©!!!
Great video Ken! For 2021 I was thinking of a project that predicts the value of magic: the gathering cards on the secondary market. I'll try to combine sentiment analysis (taken from twitter) and data from online tournaments to do so. It's a greedy project, but I can use it if it works so it's a win/win haha
This is perfect timing. I'm just about to finish my master in physics and decided I'd like to transition into the data science field.
I've been watching tons of your videos the last few weeks, and they helped me a lot to make the decision to become a data scientist and how to start the journey!

Thanks!
Ken since you emphasize learning programming, use the term library not package. Yes, a nitpick but we should not be using cutesy terms when talking about programming and the vast collections of ready-built functions/methods. Your videos are always informative.
I understand programming (Full Stack web Development), but for Data Science is it worth getting a Masters or should I learn this skill by my self?  I don‚Äôt have a STEM degree, but a BA in psych
Yeah Ken! Well done! Hope all is well with you and happy holidays!
I think we all would agree that we like hearing you speak, all advices packed with practical, wholesome  and nutritious food for thought. Do I smell an early sign of another viral video, great video Ken! üòÜ
Some of the projects that I look forward to in 2021 is to look into transformers and its application in computational drug discovery, would be awesome to reverse engineer and decode those molecular descriptors to new compounds.
Kaggle micro-courses are the shit
For 2021 after I finally have acquired enough basic skills I want to work on a Soccer project and maybe get my hands on some professional Call of Duty data.
Hey Ken! I can bear your voice for 24 hours if you talk about Data Science and Machine Learning.........
Great video Ken!
Your content have been sky rocketing this year bro, really in needs from your content especially to become a better data scientist in general. Thanks and keep posting bro
I am working on a project, which I need to recommend slow moving products with fast moving products. It will help to reduce the long tail of the sales distribution. Any recommendations for my approach should I get?
I am in healthcare 
And would like to finds ways to reduce our overall length of stay
Could you make a video on how to start a sports blog? Or maybe drop me some advice on good websites to start on? I want to create a sports analytics blog to share code and talk through projects of mine.
I am working on my personal portfolio website ( using Django ) .. I finished the form and layout I just need to add some projects and host it online. I'll do my best to finish by january 1st so I can join you in the #66DaysOfData. I was wondering if I could send you the website for feedback if possible ( doesn't have to be a youtube video, I just want to know what you think ) .. Thanks for the video Ken :)
Projects I‚Äôm working on:

GOAT-Analysis :
Analysis and comparison on Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James. Who was the best player of all time?

NFL Databowl:
Quantifying pass defense and finding the best strategies against offenses
What was your first programming language and How long it took you to learn that?

Question to ken and everyone

Mine was javascript and it took me around 1 month (with a lot of procrastination) to learn the basics.
I LOVE YOU KENNN!!! I started  my project on Titanic data set on kaggle. Your example on it is saving my time in the research stuff. I'm a beginner And I hope to meet you somedayyy
There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found "Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice:  you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!
You're just the best!
I started the 66 data journey with you but wasn't able to keep up, but you always motivate me, hope to be more sincere this time.
A structured curriculum should be made, at least for me to be more, you know,  sincere.
Maybe starting with Kaggle and online courses..
So many different courses, competition, everything gets me so overwhelmed, maybe because I just look through it instead of starting, but not this time, I will make use of time!
Listening to you today, made my day!
Thanks, KJ
Merry Christmas!
Project learning and 66days of data are efficient and fun methods to learn!
Hello ken 
It's amazing how you highlight the main points and gave us some good advice ... already started the #66daysofdata and also took your course of 365 data science platform : that's some real advice we are talking about in that course üíØ 
Wish you luck and in advance happy new yearüíØüòä
OMG you are blowing up fast... Last time I remember you had 106k subscribers. Now you have 108k! You deserve it though... Congrats!!!
best notification of the day
My first project for 2021, which I plan to complete during the 66 days:

I think the Marine Corps is stratifying its officer corps through selection of all schools and command opportunities through selection boards, or panels. I believe these boards are subject to heavy confirmation bias and anchoring. 
I'm going to analyze the recidivism rate of the boards, using SQL joins (which i know how to do, sort of...) and web scraping, which i don't know at all. Planning to learn enough of that over Christmas to get the job done.
Im trying to learn data science, but i don't have college degree
It will be amazing to see your next initialization of the Journey in Data Science soon. Actually, I am planning to read and Implement on as many books as possible in 2021. I am so happy to be a part of your community and it's really helping me to grow in my Data Science Journey. Thanks for everything, Ken.
It looks like you wrote on your shower wall with an expo marker. They do say the best ideas come in the shower...
I am just on the verge of that start a project phase. I feel the urge to jump ahead but I am committing to finishing the machine learning course from google because I know I need more of a foundation. Should not take long, I plan on starting my first project this week. 

I think it would be cool for me to do a sort of reaction/breakdown of this video and how it relates to my journey for a more in the dirt perspective if that's ok with you. (not that your perspective isn't good, just that I don't need to start over because I have barely even started, I think you know what I mean haha)
Thanks Ken üëç
That's awesome! That was the first data science video I ever watched. It led to a 3 hour Ken Jee binge watch, and my first professional connection request on LinkedIn.  

Thanks for being so approachable and helpful, Ken.
Hey Ken! I am almost finishing my university degreed in market research & marketing and I am going to focus in data science/data engineering. Currently my friends are telling me to buy a M1 Macbook but I am not sure about compatibilities with OSX and I am not familiarised with Macs (I have always being a Windows user). Do you think it is a good idea or is it better to stick with this Zbooks or any other similar Windows laptop?
Can you review the new Z desktops for data science?
How can we become one?
I think it is about this laptop you were talking about in yt leaderboard video, thankfully I have found your channel early enough to get a chance of winning this and this motivates me even more to pursue data science as I will be able to watch your videos then and maybe win this amazing laptop as a byproduct alongside the knowledge I will gain studying data science
I see you use Spyder IDE at about 0:58. The data science stack includes PyCharm and VS Code. Which you do you like best? I am still deciding between Spyder and VS Code.
Yo my dad works for tableu and they lookin for sponsors you should hit them up
Loving your new videos Ken. Keep doing good work.
Congrats on the play button, Ken! You are def one of the coolest YouTube channels out there. Great content.
7:02 it's a pretty great mouse.
Where did you get it from?üòÇ
I have a laptop that I uninstalled windows 10 from and installed Ubuntu,  is the data science stack available for a single download or is that something to do a download for each program?
Awesome new digs in Hawaii. I'm in Chicago burbs. Totally jealous! Hoping for some in depth content about Nvidia RAPIDS.
Spit my water out when you came out the box at 0:36 

Congrats again on becoming a global ambassador for HP Ken!
I think that I need a computer like this! My Mac keeps crashing with all of the 4k footage!
Sorry for saying this but the laptop looks ugly AF
The B roll and editing is amazing! The pre-installed DS stack + sheer power is incredible! Can't wait to see the cool things you'll do :D
Man.. I started liking you. But honestly, you are terrible at acting. The first scene when you were bringing the boxes inside.. you were keep looking at the camera.. I enjoyed the video and keep making them..
Cool video..cool workstation üî•
Congrats on your 100k subscribers
7:28 statquest!!
San Pellegrino only for professionals
great video! and congrats on the 100k plaque!!
Talking about Virtual Machines, I would love it if you make a step-by-step guide on how to set up one and SSH into it from another computer. Running a dummy script using the resources of the remote machine would go along with it really well.
Sometimes i comment,  sometimes i don't but i am here.
Can you get us a discount code in the future maybe?
Hahaha the intro was weird in a very funny way .. Congrats Ken I'm really happy for you, although I think maybe a box full of tropical fruits might have made u even happier lol :3
My best friend works for HP and this project has been his baby for the past two years. Super excited to his project released to the public!
Congratz on the 100,000 subscribers. Well deserved!
Have you ever used/owned a Macbook Pro? Just curious to hear your thoughts on how this compares with one of those. Great video as always.
haha the intro...The struggle was real
Really an awesome Product and nice unboxing too.
Ken Jee: *masters in computer science
Also Ken Jee: "I'm not a full blown computer person"
Is there anywhere I can find the Kaggle web conference you gave with Nvidia? I didn't get a chance to watch it at work.
Congrats on the silver Button Kenny boy. I can see you getting to a mil and being the Ali abdaal of data science
I like that mountains view in your backyard ken :), that me little nostalgic about my hawaii trip few years back. And Nice HP Z setup and congratulations on your 100k silver button :)
Wondering which body part I can sell to buy the Z laptop :p
Love that one!! Also the silver play buttonüòú
Congrats, I am very happy for you! üëè
Thanks for watching everyone! I had a ton of fun making this video, and I hope you enjoyed the increased production value. Special thanks to Z by HP and NVIDIA for making this possible! I just got this discount code for the hardware from HP! Use:  "HPDS15" at checkout for the zbook studio or create 15% off!

hey ken! is this still ongoing?
I didn't see a playlist for this effort... I think you can build one that includes videos from all channels of concern... It will help us watch these in the best order....
Streamlit say "Oh no"
lol is the mask overlay a joke? i hope it is
Just commenting to get points. Like me, pls.ü§£ü§£
Hi Ken, can you tell me what is the small white white marker board made of that you use to sketch ideas? (E.g. at 11:10) Or how do you call it? I would like to get something like this to write out my thoughts, plans, todos.
New to this channel and this is really interesting. Looking forward to more content from u! üòÑ
This kind of videos is extremely helpful for beginners. Although I'm still very early in this DS journey (I've just started learning math and statistics), it helps me understand what I need to be able to do in the future. Thanks, Ken.
I'mma get the first prize one dayüí™üèº
Thanks for giving an idea about how project works. Seems bit tricky hopefully can prepare myself till my graduation
Awesome way to get the audience engaged more
The video is cute, you are cute, subscribing to my channel was cute, when sitting on the ground in front of the couch your face was underexposed, the whiteboard was blurred (you may want to have a smaller aperture / higher F number). Keep up with the cute content! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Believe me, I was in 7th heaven when I got the Nvidia DL credits. It's lots of money for the third world country like India Ken. Thanks so much for giving us all the opportunity to be part of your channel. I don't want to miss any day watching your channel, I know I will find something interesting and impowering here.
this is a great initiative üëÄ

Ken! I'm not sure if you're actively maintaining the existing version of the leaderboard but it's throwing an "AttributeError" for the monthly view
https://share.streamlit.io/playingnumbers/youtube_leaderboard/main/leaderboard.py
I have a truly marvelous comment, but this section too small to contain it.
Why did you use a lambda function? Isnt leaderboard constantly calling DB via api to check latest updates?
this is very interesting I am going to try and build this as one of my projects... thanx Ken
Wow üî•
Hi Ken, the leaderboard is damm good and creative,Really impressed on  how you thought of using on the generated data from YouTube. Can you add this to the Github so that some of them can have a Idea on deploying their app using Streamlit.
Very interesting
And the spamming begins now
Great job! I really like how you showed your process and tools. Streamlit is new to me. APIs can be a pain. I need to practice more using APIs, but this definitely opened my mindset on taking on a project dealing with getting data using API to be able to problem solve some of these issues. Thanks for sharing!
on the way to top 5üòÖ
It's amazing that how you get ideas in your mind with picking up the projects and stuff‚ù§Ô∏è.
Short and insightful video..Great thanks
I‚Äôm wondering how other YouTube personalities could use this leaderboard and how you repurpose it for others. As a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù it could be sensational. $$$
just checked it out, it's cool. Well done
Do you have any plans on making a deep learning playlist?
Hey Ken, loved the way you built this project thank youu!!
I think this is a game changing idea. Like just the possibilities that could be achieved. Linking the viewer and the creator
Wow you are great
Great example of how a data science can be part-time developer. Thanks for the video.
What does your rich friend do for a living please?
Engagement points: definitely a fun idea. Dedication to the implementation of said concept: admirable. Overall, inspiring to me as a newcomer in this community. I hadn't yet thought about the fact that such a community existed on Youtube, now I'm excited to see more of it. Thanks for the thought and time you put into this!
Hello Ken, 

I think your leaderboard doesn't work now! it showed an error message.
Kenjee: this seems simple.
Project:- do you think so
What a fantastic and interactive way to increase engagement!
Smart move, very smartüëç... I'm blown away
Blown my mind! This is so relevant as I‚Äôve mostly seen projects that focus on modeling and not an end to end. This gives a workflow on how you established. Thanks Ken.
Hey Ken this is actually great. It really good to have a leaderboard. As data science is very interesting but sometimes it's hard to watch the whole video üòÇ no doubt content is amazing brother but it takes time for me as well probably 2-3 weeks for learning and understanding properly. I hope leaderboard will trigger me... More than gifts it will be more useful for learning...
Yo this is sick, can't believe i missed watching this till now. But dude thank you, if I made a leaderboard for which resource helped me most, your channel would be at the top as well. I'm def winning 2021 lol tough luck to everyone else
Dude this is so awesome, not only is it useful and practical but also inspiring! Nice to see how all of these things come together. I hadn't a single clue what docker was until this video lol. Awesome work!
This is a nice way to keep engaged in learning and hustle for more. Because the prizes make you feel like you have made something good in your time.
Is there already video about your workspace, Ken Jee?!
It will be interesting to see if the act of measuring effects the dependent variables.
I suspect some people may now be reluctant to like a comment as it may detract from their own comment.

Maybe there should have been a blind benchmark for a period of time before announcing the leaderboard.

I suppose people could prove me wrong by liking this comment.
Checkmate.
**Finally, a real project with clear goals and a clear explanation of the execution.
There needs to be more videos showing this type of real life data science/engineering.
Awesome job.**
Another great work by you Ken Jee, keep the good work and sharing man! The use of Docker as the communicator was cool. :)
this is awesome. you will probably be the first :))
Ken Jee is the Data Science hero we all need....













But never deserve.
Hey! What 3x3 do you have?
heheüòÖ I just watched this video (I know too late)
It's an amazing way to interact with your viewers.
Love these videos ... very satisfying
hlo ken, is there any course or playlist in which u have implemented this project from scratch? .. actually i want to learn this to make my CV more impressive :)
Great project! Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have the Engagement Points formula like this =Comment Replies + Comment Likes - Num of Comments, so that only comments that get likes (i.e are useful for others) or create engagement (through replies) give you points? This would completely remove the option of getting EP through mass commenting. Just food for thought. Otherwise love the project and love your channel!
Make sure what you feed to the model: "GARBAGE-IN -> GARBAGE-OUT".
Appreciate the videos.  Keep up the good work
Me : sees the leader board
also Me : jumps to 9:08 PRIZES
 Me few minutes later : plans to comment on every single vid
How can I get all these into my head üòü
Oh man, I loved this video! I contacted a programmer about creating just THIS, an engagement scoreboard, months ago, but I didn't follow through. I'd love to purchase this service from you like... NOW! üòÄ
Is there a way to see the score of a particular user, even if they are not in the top? (yeah, I want to know where I am haha)
This is awesome! Even though I barely understood a word of how you built this.. I'm definitely someone who's hesitant to engage in the comments (but look at me now?) Looking forward to your future videos.
This is a very engaging comment.
I actually like how you prevent spam. I was literally commenting a similar idea as you said it. Nice work.
Love the overall presentation of the video! Excellently done.
My own interaction with the YouTube API has been limited so far, well below the usage limits.
This is exactly the type of video I enjoy watching :)
Such a cool project. Unfortunate about the Amazon trap. Jeff is good. Too good.
I really love the spirit of this.  I'm also really thankful you're providing the source code.  I have a more traditional web app (JavaScript) background and am currently learning Data Science and Machine learning.  Short of the flask server from your previous video I've had a hard time picturing how a web application stack would look with data models.  Looking forward to how this grows, and welcome to the microservices black hole!
Hi Ken, This looks cool! It‚Äôs interesting to see how a data scientist plays around the data. Though I‚Äôm still at the early stage of practicing basic skills and may not use these fancy tools soon, I‚Äôd like to have some fancy mindset. Thanks for sharing!
So cool!!
Nice project idea
Great idea!!
Incredible Work. Now I will need to create a Bot to Comment to your New Video.. I think this will help me To Get Ahead in Your Leaderboard... 
Sorry Bro .. We Dont have any other Option ....
You should make this a product that other creators can use. I am sure you have thought of it already though.
Wohoo.. that's really cool Ken.. I'm a beginner.. and I'm so much interested in knowing more about DS ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Ken, this is really cool!
This is so sick... Thanks for the linked resources, this is the kind of thing I've always wanted to do!
You really are amazing man, as a beginner in ds am in a right place.
Great work. All Youtubers would like to use it which will encourage subs to participate more.
Now that's how a real data scientist work
*I have data*
*youtube algorithm wants comments for growth* 
*create a leaderboard with prizes*

Such a amazing idea, Respect
This is super coooolüí´
"I swear I'm not trying hard to get Ken's attention; I just need to comment on every video for the giveaway!" Haha but seriously I think this is a good push to start engaging more with channels.
What an interesting project. I‚Äôm curious to see how it turns out. Fantastic giveaways also. A very well done video. 8 love your subtle humor.üòÇ
Let's just take a moment to appreciate how awesome Ken is ... truly an inspiration... as a data science student, you're my idol.
The hiding memes in plain sight always gets me. Epic Intro and Nice ideas list. I'm happy that you didn't go with Human Sacrifice. :D :D :D
This video! I love how you explained your step-by-step process so clear and visually. 
NGL at 9:08 I was waiting to see you end in a full-on Savasana on that yoga matüòú
This is such a wholesome project - great work Ken! :) and those dried shiitake mushrooms from Costco tho...üòç
Awesome project! The experience of running into one foe after another definitely hit home hard lol
I'm coming for that #1 spot!
Ken tackles BIG YOUTUBE himself. Very nicely put together diagrams, excited to see who will top the charts Ken :)
My favorite part of this video is when Ken admits that it was a pain in the ass.  It's a cool project, but even some cool projects can be a PITA.
This is incredible!!
Personally would have gone with "More Dinosaurs," but hey. 

Love the 4DX concepts used here.
This one is amazing üî• 
Also i have one question 
Do data analyst need to work in office or can be done WFH too.
Great stuff! Need more about nba-api tho
An amazing idea Ken!  I just signed up for a lot of courses in computer vision.  Its amazing you are partnered with Nvidea! Also, your setup with streamlit, docker and AWS is exactly the type of stuff I'm trying to get into.  Great job!
I love how you were able to make the information both educational and entertaining. Like you took us on the journey. Do you recommend learning SQL, while learning python?
Big fan of this initiative. I think there is a lot of potential in learning from comment data. What were some of your machine learning ideas that you're looking into?
This is SO cool. Thanks for sharing Ken! üôå
Please make a tutorial for the same... I'll be more than happy üòä
Congrats Ken!
I am happy someone is using streamlit üòú
Hey this is pretty neat! I noticed you hadn't uploaded recently and I was curious why. Definitely was worth the wait. I also like how you dealt with the possible spam commenters. The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute is a cool idea for a prize. I've done some of those courses myself and thought they were very much worth it.
What about me ü•∫ I‚Äôm watching your EVERY VIDEO and I don‚Äôt skip the ads so you can make a buck... I‚Äôm always giving a like too ‚ù£Ô∏è Also loving the podcasts but i dont comment on them bc nothing good comes to my mind. I didn‚Äôt do it for the prize though it‚Äôs only pure love ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is one of the best projects I have come across @ken Jee, Nice Work! üëçüèªüíØüí•
This idea was so brilliant. It's not Ken Jee anymore, it's GOD JEE now.
This is really a great initiative to encourage the usage of data in real life.
really get to learn so much from you & your channel content. Just keep making & improving the quality of your videos. it's awesome.
one quick suggestion: why not making your Intro of the video, little bit minimalistic (or in DS words, make it clean for exploratory analysis hehe).
thanks Kenneth.
One word... COOL.... üòç
How about uploading a series explaining how you built those integrations?

After finishing my "first ds project from scratch" I decided to take the next step which is to put a script on a virtual machine and build a SQL database. Lol
Oh my God, Ken! You amazed me with the cool project that I never thought it would be interesting. I also like how you explained the flow charts easily and smoothly. Thanks for sharing the resources as well! Keep up the good work towards the end of 2020!
It's cool! Hope you will make a playlist on how to set up this from scratch :D and again thank you Ken for your informative videos. I am a newbie and I am learning a lot from these.

Just a suggestion üôÇ
* Sees potential prizes * üëÄ
* Starts spamming comment sections of Ken's videos *
Interesting concept
It's amazing to see and know about it, Ken.
When normal person see data: it's just numbers
When data scientist see data: these numbers tells so many things.
Very cool.
That was a really cool man...(¬¨‚Äø¬¨) awesome project Ken one of the best videos for me till now...really you are awesome ken...lots of important stuff to grab from this project...thank you so much Ken for sharing this...üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°...
Very cool way to engage with your community. I used Docker a bit for work but I have still learn a lot about it. Also I have yet to tried server less lambda.
This is phenomenal!!! Yes, 3 exclamation points phenomenal.  Solving problems while trying to solve a problem.

I was just thinking to myself yesterday, too "I haven't seen Ken post any videos lately, is he abandoning us for the podcast?"

Always fascinated by watching the process play out. Great video
I am satisfied with my performance :P ...at least in the list.  I wanted a keyboard... But working on the project so will try my best in the community..You have a long way to go Ken...Be the same soft spoken yet slightly funny but at the end an honest guy...and as always thank you, mentor...
COMMENT FOR THE LEADERBOARD
Very Cool project Ken :)
Just curious, why did you use the EC2 server instead of another scheduled lambda for populating the SQL instance?
I like that u always find a way to explore the things and make valuable project, which always intrigued me!!
When the video started, i thought "Oh this seems pretty simple, I can maybe try it later"
And then everything later went over my head lol.
This is so cool! I am working on a 'not so great' project too (since the last 1 month lol).
oh, you napping, hugging something you love <3 

Interesting project, looking forward to see your collab with Tina too. I too have an idea for a small DS project based on yt data (haven't seen many DS projects based on yt data as opposed to tons and tons of projects based on Twitter data), so I'm really curious what you guys will do.
Hell yeah, another project video! These are the best! Very cool stuff you did with this one, even though I didn't get much of the advanced topics yet

But I'd love to see another one of those step-by-step project like you did with the DS jobs code. You planning on doing something like that?
No project is simple when it comes to implementation ü§ï
Okay now I'm excited for next year ü§ú I didn't understand all the technical stuff but the project is very interesting .. Can't wait to see your video with Tina
Everyone: parents don't pick favourite children
Ken Jee:
Thanks Ken for this fun edutainment video! A great way to integrate data science to the YouTube space and I really like the breakdown of how you built the Leaderboard. Also really appreciate the kind shoutout! Looking forward to the collab with Tina.
3:17 Let's do this üòÜ
10:43 Nice catch!
That's a nice project can we integrate it with some other interactive platform with few change implied in it.
I'm not like others, I'm interested in the giveaway part only.. :)
Man this is really cool! Is there a way you could disable adding points for responding to your own comment? I know you asked us not to, but...
Hilarious video. I enjoy your sense of humour, Ken. :)
I am having a hard time installing docker in my Mac
Omgg such a really good project and I am loving the giveaway part as wellüòâüòÇ
Would love some more project ideas to work on.üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è

How  @Tina Huang  Chose Hers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8iL4V-y1Qs&ab_channel=TinaHuang
Why do you have 3 hours üò≥
I picked a data science programme at a university and found out (after getting my acceptance) that the course is new and had no alumni. I talked to a professor of the course but still was not able to get the information that I required. Is it a good idea to go forward with the course?
Would a bachelors in CS with a concentration in DS be enough to break through?
1. What you will be learning?  i.e. Curriculum
2. Job Placement Opportunities? Check the stats and connect with alumni
3. Class diversity and flexibility i.e. look for institutions offering courses you want
4. Place of education i.e. online or offline (based on personal preference)
5. Duration  - full-time or part time 
6. Research and Internship i.e. need real world experience (co-op etc.)
7. Monetary considerations - may not get job after masters. 
8. International Students - STEM and OPT considerations
I got accepted into UC San Diego MS Data Science and although I wanted to get into an MSCS. UC San Diego was the most prestigious school I got into and I think that will at least land me interviews
Currently I‚Äôm majoring in CS and am debating getting a minor in statistics or management information systems. My school also offers a data Analytics degree from the business school that I‚Äôve thought about switching to, but I‚Äôm unsure what the best route would be for getting a job as a data scientist. I‚Äôm assuming more technical skills from CS would be better. Any thoughts?
3:07so glad once again to live in Germany where University isn't free, but compared to the US it is (~1800$ for a Bachelors- and ~1200$ for a Masters degree)
Is a thesis requirement generally a good sign of the rigor of the program? If the topic is applicable to the job you are applying for, I would believe this would be a good thing.
Thanks for adding Tina
FOCUS ON SKILLS.
THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE
Can I do a master in data science without a relevant bachelor degree?
Heyy currently looking around for options but can you tell me do you think doing data science post graduation degree program will bring a boost in my career?
Thinking of joining online program for that üíØ
Where is Tina from if not from us?
omg when Tina did not have the mic she has now @.@
2:14 What stronger foundation is there than Statistics? This is one of the first things I look for.
This is a very informative video. What are your thoughts on the Masters of Data Analytics degree from WGU. I have been interested lately in pursuing that degree after I complete my undergraduate.
Awesome video! Stumbled across this video while looking for information on searching for a masters program. Completed my undergrad in accounting but considering pursuing a masters in data science at DePaul. All these tips certainly help. 

Thanks again for your knowledge!
I wish I seen this video before I started my master degree, but good for future generations.
Boss , I don‚Äôt understand why ur subscribers are not million ?

I still didn‚Äôt subscribe eventhough ur long time followers , hope very soon I will click subscribe button üòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ u deserve it, boss
Matlab is still used a lot. It is not outdated. It just is not really for statistics and data science. It is still an important tool for engineers, the basic sciences and mathematicians. Still would not recommend it for data science, unless you expect to work in engineering and colleagues use it a lot. It is just too expensive to justify it, unless you know your employer will gladly pay for it (and all the separate toolboxes).
Hello!  Thank you so so so much for this informative video!  I just wanted to ask if anybody has heard and have thoughts about the data science masters at Rutgers University.  It's a fairly new program that was established in 2016/17 and I can't seem to find many testimonials on it. Thanks!
Do you need a masters degree to be a good data scientist?
Thank you Ken and Tina so so much. This is so helpful. I have finally picked a part-time online master's degree.
HAHAHAHA you flipping that coin made me laugh so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks, Ken and Tina for the detailed information...
Hi Ken, this is Chaitanya here from. India. First of all thanks for the videos & suggestions. I just saw ur video explaining ur suggestions on things to consider for before joining the degree course or institute. Not sure i  can ask a question in this forum, but asking anyways out of curiosity by taking a leaf out of your 7 things explained here. I am Planning to join a course in coming jan 2021 so can i send u the curriculum & seek ur inputs on how good, useful it is? If yes how can i contact u for that? I am sorry if u feel that it is wrong question or in wrong forum
me straight jumping straight to 2:10 after playing the video
A current master here: 30% comes from the uni as a big index along the courses you have and demanding you to pass the exams. 70% from really learning from other sources online.

Rankings are just marketing and must be ignored, look from pros and cons from the uni and the location to avoid surprises (especially as an international), get money from wherever you can as you will have enough stress from learning, and prepare in advance to reduce that 70% to save time and enjoy the journey.
Love your videos, speaking from Brazil. I'm looking for an MBA in Data Science so I can work in the area, is there any different comments on MBA instead of MS? I want to study a Public Administration MS to study open data and smart cities. So in my head it is a good deal.
Tina and Ken, so many answers to my questions included in a empathetic, storytelling resource. It will fine tune my research on MSc Programs on Big Data Analytics . üëè
Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?
Thanks, Ken for the great content! Would an online master's degree be something to consider? I'm interested in a new program being offered by the University of colorado boulder: https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/online-overview Any thoughts or suggestions?
Hey Ken! New to your channel. Totally impressed with the content you put out. Could really use your suggestions on this path I'm considering. https://www.dataquest.io is an interactive platform to master data science & having tried it,(free trial) felt like an engaging way to learn. They're offering the annual subscription for abt $400. I'm a complete newbie to this with a background in sales & a bachelor's in commerce. You recommend signing up?
I've thought about a MS for data science, but a MS in computer science with a concentration in data science makes more sense as you have more optionality for career prospects.
This video has a little over half the comments of the leaderboard one with 3x the views, that leaderboard is really going to boost engagement. Youtube hacks!
Super useful video as I look at my options for the future!
Hi i am masters student at Liverpool John Uni. @ml and cloud. 
Love your content.üëç
Hello sir! Hope you are doing fine despite this pandemic. The question I'm gonna ask might be irrelevant to this video, but it is about data science. I was wondering, is there any international data science societies where students can be a part of to improve our skills? if yes, could you please name some. Thank you!!
I want to start collecting and analyzing data for my rugby club but I don‚Äôt know where to start. I have knowledge in python and some excel, what do you recommend? Maybe a site or a course to get more info?
Hey. Thank you. Can you tell me do you plan to interview anyone about writing data related articles or upload tips and tricks and suggestion about writing in places like medium?
Let‚Äôs be honest..... if your overall objective is to get a job.... why care about the school? Just get the cheapest one and get it over with
New to your channel and kind of fall in love with all the contents. Informative guidelines gave me a feeling of feasibility.
You and Tina make an awesome duo!  No wonder this channel has 100K subscribers!
I'm currently in a full time masters program for data analytics and feeling less than happy with my choice. I wish I'd considered all of these things a little bit more before making my choice so that I could have found a program that challenged me in the ways I want. Another facet to consider is your actual life situation. I'm married, I own my home, and I live near my university, so that definitely influenced my decision. I didn't want to sell my home, move my family to a new town, and then pay out-of-state tuition.... but, OH, HOW I WISH I HAD üòÇ This was a great video, Ken!! I keep thinking I should share my experiences with people here on YouTube, but it feels so nerve-wracking!
Hi, this was amazing not only because I‚Äôm applying in February for fall 2021, but also that I‚Äôm an international student so great bonus as there‚Äôs no good info online. Question though, do you recommend taking the GRE? The school I‚Äôm applying to says it‚Äôs only ‚ÄúRecommended‚Äù and mostly for lower GPA students.
Thank you for sharing!!!
You are a gift üí´
This is very informative, thanks a lot, Ken :)
Special thanks to Tina, her yt channel is so amazing with very helpful content. Thanks, guys :)
Love this video, Ken & Tina. Anyway, I am wondering that do we have take degree in data science major instead of other major? Because learning data science can be anywhere (online course, bootcamp) and learning the domains (energy, finance, health) are quite hard because we need facilities that we don't have.

How about my statement, Ken?
Yay thanks for having me :D A resource I wish I had before I picked my masters degree! And I need to say again - FANTASTIC EDITING!!
Great video as always master master Ken!
Hey Ken, great video. 

I‚Äôm currently doing my BS in Data Science and plan on getting a full time job when I graduate, and have been looking at Georgia Techs Online Masters in Analytics to do part time. Do you know anything about this program / would you recommend doing the computer science one instead?
Great video Ken on the 8 golden tips for selecting a data science masters degree! Oh and did the green dinosaur got bigger?
Loved the cameo @Tina Huang and @Ken Jee, it's a collabgiving Charlie Brown
Hello Ken !! Nice Video. I have a small doubt , is it good to have some Tableau Skills to add to Data Science resume ? I was planning on going through some MOOCs but thought about checking with you once ,  before I proceed ahead . Thanks in advance. üôèüôè
Hey Ken! What is the difference between a masters in Data Science vs a masters in Business Analytics?
Great video! Do you have any videos about your experience at Depaul? I'm enrolling next year.
This is a good video. Tina's advice/input on course-based masters was definitely useful. I wish I knew about that going into my master's program. I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons. I'll have to add this topic to the list of video ideas I got.
So, does that mean it's necessary to have a degree ???
Start of video is same I look now üòÇ confused
Informative. For someone who just this week applied for  Datascience course..this is gold!
Great video!
Great video and all very relevant points.
Currently doing my M.Sc. in Data Science with the university of London. I'm also working full-time and I will honestly not recommend anyone doing the program full-time while working full-time if you aren't already working in data science or have a strong base in the field. I'm in 4 classes this semester, and while I have a strong math background and comfortable programming in python, my programming skills are not the greatest and I am new to the Data Science field. I have found the time commitment to be a lot. Next semester I am definitely not taking more than 3 courses.
The editing keeps elevating!
I have a video suggestion: best ways to build an online presence as a data analyst/scientist. Like should it just be git, or YouTube and a website. What content to put up etc
Very informative üíØ‚úåÔ∏è

 Thank you so much.. .....

Man the editing was spot on, also extremely informative. Will definitely follow these steps and revisit this video.

Thanks for starting a great initiative, even after many months its trending in Data Science community. Many people even started similar initiative like 100daysofSQL etc. Its awesome to see how a simple idea can grow this big and influence so many people. Thanks.
Thanks for the great initiative Ken...
discord link is not working
Hey Ken,

Thank you so much for all the work you put in your videos. 
Back in May, I started my data science journey after 5 years in project management and I was kind of lost on what path to choose. Following your advice, I started online courses, then worked on Kaggle projects, and finally built a portfolio. 

Now, 7 months later, I landed my first internship as a data scientist ! What tipped the scales in my favor was the portfolio, which I made thanks to the Hugo tutorial on your channel !

So here, thanks from a grateful subscriber =)
Hey Ken, I am finishing a boot camp where by the end of next week I‚Äôll have spent 630 hours over 9 weeks, that‚Äôs 10 hours a day, studying Python and data analytics. I will definitely join you in January to keep up the momentum I have gained. I enjoying listening to you in my down time.
* does data science for a couple of months
*Winds up with a cool project idea

Did your comment leaderboard idea come from these 66 days?
Ken, due to lockdown I really wasted a huge amount of time which whereas I was planning to be so productive and to master on DL. However, on that gap, I lost the knowledge I had :)) and added more to my depression and imposter syndrome. Now walking through your youtube videos (you have done quite great stuff when I was not out there ) makes me feel safe that I'm actually not that late and I can start it over, I believe that community is going to have a great impact on me! Thank you, I'm saying this deeply :)

Hey I'm so inspired and the problem is that i don't know anything about data science and i belongs from arts background and i want to start from a zero i hope you get me please tell from where should i start

Hi Ken, nice video! I didn't participate in this one but I'll join the discord server and do the next one! Quick question: what video editing software do you use? I see in your description your computer details and the camera you use, and I searched throughout your channel to make sure you didn't have a video talking about this stuff, so I'm sorry if you get asked this a lot, I just am going to be done with my second-to-last semester of grad school this week (!!!) and have like, 2 months for christmas break so I was going to spend some time learning editing stuff so I can hopefully start my own youtube channel soon enough. I can't afford the camera yet, but I don't need that to start. I've got some ideas and I just am curious to know what software you use to edit your videos. Do you have a preamp and a mic with a pop filter you use? Thanks!
I have got an why don't you and Andrew make a video on begginer pack of #66daysofdata like roadmap for beginners for 66days challenge something like that?....
Just a suggestion üôÇüíØ
@Ken Jee this was an absolute journey so far. I think we can have the version2.0 to be more inclined towards practical implementation. We can form teams on Discors & work towards common goal, improving upon the basic we have learnt so far. 
1. We all can curate a list of projects from multiple domain & decide which one to work & with whom.
Would love to hear your thoughts on this.
Thank you @ken Jee for #66DaysOfData. I learned a lot in this challenge. Made projects using Tableau, SQL, Python. Got to know about the data science lifecycle. Looking forward for the next #66DaysOfData üåü
Loved the intro for this one! Set a really nice vibe for the rest of the video.
Thank you üôè I was really happy following it #66daysofdata
Hey Ken I did a quick quantification of the 66daysofdata hashtag here: https://github.com/dungates/TwitterStats/blob/master/66daysofdata.md
Why 66 tho?
I started following you before a week.
Lucky that i found a channel which is really "of my type".
I really believe connecting is the key whatever amouny of technical excellence you have.
Here, we just get the right mix of technical and non-technical stuff for our self-development!

I started implementing many of the corrections you told.
But sometimes I literally go off mood and the day just becomes a voidüôÅ.
I agree, the next iteration will be even better! I also struggled with creating a clear, concise plan for my journey. Now that I have a Notion template to document/plan (thanks for linking the one I created btw!ü§ó) I know that I will be even more productive during the next round! and the slow zoom-in on your dad taking care of business on the laptop was so funny hahaha love the mix of comedy in your videos. Let's gooooooo!!
The thumbnail!
Hey Ken, When I started the 66 days of data challenge my goal was to learn deep learning. I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me. I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon, Facebook, and a consultancy group. I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on. I look forward to doing this again in January.
The 66daysofdata challenge is actually helping me to get though with my degree thesis too. Seeing as I was doing the 5 min even if I was tired from work, I told myself: "If I can do 5, I can do 10!" and then set an extra goal of 5 min of daily thesis progress. Some days are harder than others, but it's working and I plan to finish it by February, and that's something a need to thank you for Ken! You really are an inspiration.
Ken please answer my query, 
I am a SE with 1 year of experience, I am learning ML/DS since around 6 months and recently I talked to the management of my company for transition to data science. 
They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math (look at it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225708015_Impact_on_inventory_costs_with_consolidation_of_distribution_centers).

I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same. 
What should I do? Shall I drop the idea of becoming a data scientist or apply in other places with different domain.
Great! Now we can do another end to end Data science/analytics projects.
Great thumbnail üòÇ
You are doing a great job my man
I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the "5 mins a day" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!
Great video! Love the T-rex! There‚Äôs 2!
Thank you so much for mentioning my Journey right there Ken. I really appreciate it and I still remember that you support my idea at the very moment when I was confused to add on GitHub or not. Yeah, This Journey taught us a lot and I am proud of myself that I spend my time with many amazing persons. Honestly, you are the inspiration for us and excited about the next Journey as well !!
I didn't knew about it when it started so I will do now
Next project: 66 days of gains üòú
Hey Ken! I'm also Ken ehe. Hope to be a Data Scientist/Analyst someday. Thanks for videos, it gladly helps me and motivates me to enter to this industry.
Kudos to all!!
So, the extra finger you'd like to have is pinky üòÇ
As usual, nice to see you ! 
Keep inspiring us üòá
Hi Ken, I'm looking forward to the next 66days on linkedin. I had planned to join in the last one, but had trouble with twitter.
Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)

And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the "Silent Flute".
The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms! 

One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, "seemed to know everything" he simply answered with this:

"Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day." ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added "... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it."

I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. 

Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. 

Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly). 

Good luck to everyone for not just your #66daysofdata, not your #666daysofdata but, why not?, your #alifeofdata ;)
It's much effective.üëç
"Just google everything first." YES.

And yes, I also suffered from not starting with a plan or consistently sharing what I actually did/learned. Oops. I delegated the first part to kaggle, Data Camp, etc. and that just isn't long term sustainable or even short term optimal. No regrets though. :)
Feel free to pose questions in the comment section here as well! Will do my best to get to them all!
would you recommend the new macbooks for data science? Im looking for a new laptop which a long battery life and lightweight, any recommendation here?
Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. 

Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.

However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.

Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community. TOC2 will make it much easier.
Oh Dang Congrats, I remember when you had less than 25K. Keep it up, brother!
Very helpful session. Looking forward to more of these. Thanks.
P.S. The questions were visible well enough  @ 720p. And it was good that you made them visible.
This comment stood out to me the most: "Maybe it's more about the critical mass of what you create than the growth of the videos" (39:46). To me, it speaks to cultivating internal motivations, having an internal locus of control and understanding that above all else, you must do the work.

(And thanks for your answer to my questions, Ken. I can certainly appreciate the wisdom in planning in broad strokes and letting life fill in the details.)
Loved the session really helpful and learned a lot üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
Many thanks Ken for your live program which i watched later. Time zones btw the US and Oz make it difficult to watch live.  You are doing an amazing job, paving the way for future data scientists. Great mentoring. Congratulations on your achievements
OH NO I MISSED IT!!!
This is awesome Ken Jee! Congratulations for the 100K+..Way to go :)
How do you reply too many comments (all of them) on your videos. Its too hard. But your are doing a good job keeping connection with your viewers. Thanks alot
Thanks for watching everyone! I'm having a lot of fun with the intros, I hope you all like them :). If you don't, I added chapters at the bottom so you can skip it easily!

Great tips ken but I have a really dumb question xD. Suppose I have a great project idea (lets say agriculture related), but now from where will I get the dataset?
Why do YouTubers not edit out the part of the shot where they are reaching for the camera off-button?  Is it a meme?
7:48 Are you trying to say that building models is not necessary? Could you explain your argument here?
Great advice, thanks!
These 3 techniques will really make an impact on me to go ahead. Problem identification is a very much important skill in data science.
heyy nice video! i have a question, what technique do you use to scrapp data from the comment section of your videos???  i love your channel by the way
How afraid should we be about choosing projects that end up failing?  Sometimes I get caught in this idea that I need to find the perfect projects that I know would be successful before I even start exploring the data.
02:40 What were your 10 ideas to improve airline flights?  Just curious.
WHAT?!! Good projects cannot be found in your closet, laundry, desk drawers etc ... WHY AM I ALWAYS THE LAST TO KNOW?!!!! More seriously, right now, it's not so much ideas that I have problems with at the moment, it's finding enough data to run them ... yep, that time is closing faster than I thought where I will have to learn to scrape data for myself! Especially since many of the ideas I have are around using specific type of pictures (loads of them fantasy, science fiction .... also had an idea which will requires 'solar punk' pictures, all of that in the name of ART and by using ML :o) ). 

But, more likely, it will be about scrapping for text, especially released scripts from some of my favorite series ... or old books!! ( I wonder if I can do a 'whosdunnit' NLP thingy :o) ) ... so many choices, but doesn't choice imply renouncing some of said choices ? ;o)
You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. 

I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content. This channel has been immensely helpful and inspiring to me. Keep up the good work! Hopefully this large comment adds valuable data to your corpus you're building. Sorry for the special characters you'll have to get rid of when you tokenize and clean the data lol.
Spending a bit of time to find a good idea definitely is worth it!
Once you find something you are truly passionate about, the motivation can sometimes be limitless.
In my opinion, one great project is worth more than a few okay ones, because the passion can really shine through.

(Also, awesome intro :D)
Amazing editing!! And super solid advice! :D
Ooohh, this video is on next level ken :) Amazing techniques too!
Do some more projects ken
Thank you so much! i have a question that's been bothering me, if someone worked on your insightful jobs salary project, like , started it from scratch and made changes ( different eda/including ann model..) through out the project and learned a lot from it, could they include it in their resume ? if yes, i think we must reference the owner of the idea ? or is it just better to not include it ? your project inspired me a lot and made me love data science more, thank you so much and hope you will answer my question :)
Congrats Ken, You have achieved 100k victory successfuly
Thank you for this. I'm tired of spending time watching incredibly detailed ang long video tutorials about data science without actually applying what I've learned to a project.
Ken is it Data or Data Hahah, you use both 
jk
Thanks for the video
Informative Video Ken.
Good info as always, definitely liked the analogy to coming up with new business ideas and being more specific.
Question, in the sports analytics industry how much of your time is spent on various activities?  Maintaining and updating the current data analytics?  Answering new questions that are brought up by your internal customers?  Answering your own questions or coming up with new data analytics aproaches to add value?
Hey ken I am trying to do a project on the past NBA season. Do you have any ideas where I could find extensive nba data(besides stats.nba.com)? Thanks!!
My first ever comment on YT (you are that good :) ) : thank you for these techniques. For total newbies like I am, that are not looking (yet) for originality but just build / practice basic skills (and self confidence in data science) few concrete common projects would help a lot. I get that it might not be super exciting for experts but your walk through Titanic was great. Maybe few more like these? (Disclaimer: I am really at the beginning , did not even start the Titanic project yet)
And what did you find out about your viewers? ;)

Can you become a data scientist without having a degree?
smashed the like button...üòâüëç
In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others
Oo the editing is getting next level üî•
Wow, the video editing is amazing Ken! Lot's of nicely placed puns and humor. I totally agree with your advice that coming up with project ideas is a great skill to have. In academia, one of the most important skills to be acquired during graduate study is essentially this skill of coming up with project ideas (finding solutions for solving biological data problems). Thanks for breaking down this important topic in a compact and entertaining video üòÜüëç
Thank you! ‚ò∫ You are like a project guide I also searched for during my Bachelor's degree!!!!!!  üò≠üò≠
can you start a SLACK Channel for your community ?
Any Special / Surprise Video for 100k SUB? :)))))
Looks like you are having waaaaay too much fun filming the b rolls üòÇ
Hi Kenji. Is there a trade-off between projects that are personally interesting vs portfoilo-worthy projects? Do your projects have to be directly tailored to whatever industry you're trying to get into or is there such a thing as a general data science portfolio? Thanks for your videos.
Like in advance)
Master Master Ken, this video was great, the quality of your videos is going up. Thanks bro!
2:47 hahah!
Ken is back at it again with his papayas haha
Going to be amazing seeing the title but I will go and watch the video nowüíØ
Thanks for watching everyone! This is the video I mention about how to choose between a Masters, Bootcamp, or Certificate program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FjwzKFPuM&ab_channel=KenJee
How do you go 150k in debt when even the biggest and most expensive universities cost maybe 60k for a masters degree? What?!
One like for you for only being handsome üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Can I become a data scientist without a CS or Data science degree ? I do not have any related background and considering to change my career. I am teaching myself the skills to become a data scientist but honestly I cannot pursue another degree because I cannot afford it.
Can MS in Computer Science with Data Analytics helps me to go into the Data scientist path?
I think by cs master we would be better at coding rather than data science master
Is it true?
Thanks for the video. I‚Äôm curious, do you see any benefit to getting an MBA and an MS in DS? I have a scholarship that will pay for most of both, but I‚Äôm also 35 and hesitant to go back to school for that long. If so, would you suggest one before the other? If not, could I still break in to some of the more technical roles with an MBA?
Do you have a video on how to prepare for a master in CS? My background is in chemistry so I‚Äôve never taken any CS classes.
When I was starting my Ph.D. in Computational Biology, I discovered Data Science. Now I'm slowly changing my focus to it.
CompBio uses many disciplines and concepts in common with DS, which was a very satisfying discovery when I started to read about DS.
I think it's very nice to be called Master, but man, Doctor Weiss sounds *SO evil scientist* that I couldn't help myself when choosing my path.
It's just what I wanted since I was 4 LOL
But seriously, although I'm just migrating but not there yet, it seems to me that many (or most) areas that include programming and statistics will have a good match in DS.
Hi there. I have bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and master's degree in Mechatronics. Currently, I am in UK and looking for an opportunity in Data Science. I am getting an offer to do MSc in Computer Science from Swansea University. With my interest in Data Science and educational background, is it worth doing MSc in Computer Science?
Hi Ken, What do you think of DePaul's current MSc DS program?

It seems more like its predecessor Predictive Analysis. I just saw that you teach there so I am like 100% more motivated to apply. :) :) 


Also what are the best US schools for MSc in DS for towards a path to PhD? 
Thank you chief.
Why didn't you choose a master's in Applied Statistics?

I just put in an application for a grad certificate in Applied Stats yesterday. The choice of school was made for me by these factors;
1. No GRE required
2. No recs required
3. Three intakes a year so no waiting till next year
4. Non-exirbitant tuition (under $1,000 per credit)
5. On-line program
So, your choice of discipline, or school didn't determine the outcome?  Spoiler alert: it was you.  I know multiple guys who (not a joke) went to Harvard, MIT, Stanford and/or Berkeley and didn't do half as well as some people that went to the school I went to.  Sadly, that wasn't me: but I can't complain.
DePaul Gang rise up
Thank you for the information Ken... It will help me to take the decision in the future...
Hello Ken! Thanks for the content!

I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area.

Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize?
How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome?
What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning.
What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ?
Given that I have what I believe could be considered a "technical background" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills?
How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise.

Sorry for this avalanche of questions. Hope you can answer them as I believe it would be of great help. Thank you!
Side comment you made that I find really interesting. That the education was similar everywhere you went but the students were all different. Part of the reason I want to go to a master's program or top company is to surround myself with different people than my upper middle tier college (Seton Hall). Would love to see a video talking about that it even interview you on the topic.
Man you're just reading my mind lately hahaha üòÇ great video as always master master Ken
Can you talk about master of science in business analytics??
I am planning to start my masters in busienss analytics during fall 2021. What would my course of plan be right now? 

What should I start with first? Programming or maths or excel or reporting tools??
Is it better to do a Master's in CS (by taking good electives) rather than in Data Science?
Also, does location (San Jose State) or name( Georgia Tech) matter more if you've just graduated?
Hi, Ken. I have noticed that some master programs in Data science require students to finish a research project, while others only require students to finish a capstone project. If you are hiring a new grad, do you think students with some research experience is preferable?
Can you become a data scientist without going to college?
Heyy I have got an idea like you can do a Q/A video like you can post in youtube community tab and in linkdin to ask them to give questions and you can make a video out of it üíØ‚úåÔ∏è just a suggestion ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Tech gig website listed your channel as "
5 YouTube channels every Data Scientist and ML engineer should subscribe to"
Hey Ken, great video as always. Your videos have really helped guide me through my journey into data science. So I thank you for that! I'm actually applying to grad schools for next Fall and DePaul's Master's in DS is on the list!
THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH FOR SUCH VIDEOS!!! I really love them and they make me feel happy and become a data scientist more and more ü•∞!! I‚Äôm a school student with programming background...we have learnt python pandas, numpy, pyplot as well as MySQL course at school...we have also learnt about computer networks. Next year I plan on to do bachelors in DS(4 years) and then masters in DS (1 year)...although there is one fear that I have which is that I DO NOT COME FROM A MATH BACKGROUND (I am ready to learn it tho)...do you think this could be an issue???
Wow man, 100k congrats man you deserve more than millions of milestone‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
What about an international student, who would want to get into data science and in the US job market, would diploma certificate from canada will help since its budget friendly too??
I tried studying ml on my own there is lot of gaps in my education masters is essential in this field period
Do I have to be a software developer or a data analyst first to break into data science? or can it be done directly through a masters program or certifications ?

Hey Ken
Love your videos bro
Can you suggest schools that give weightage to Sports analytics in their curriculum?
What's with the crazy caption face?
hey Ken, I noticed from your linkedin that you're based in honolulu. how do you like it there (pros? cons?) and how is the local data science job market?
Heyy, thankyou for your guidance. It's really helps a lot. 
Sorry it's a little lengthy, but it's important for us, so please read @Ken Jee
Also, as you see, there's a significant number of your followers from India, so like it's really difficult for us to check which college is best in different countries like US, UK, Germany, which are already quite advanced in this field and will be really beneficial for us if we study there, so can you suggest and help us what to do or how to go about it. I really wanna study in Germany, but you know, money is always an issue for an international student, so a little bit of guidance in that too please.
That was a great video, Master Ken! Glad you‚Äôve decided to go with DePaul which sets the first event in the domino effect that led you to posting your first video on YouTube üòä
Hi Ken, Thank you so much!
 I started learning data science 2 years back. but I lost the motivation. Now after following your channel, and watching the inspirational videos and great advice i feel confident to move forward, i am seeking career transition into data science, and you are motivating and helping me to stay on track.
I think universitty of waterloo is best for getting a fang job in bay
How many internships you did and have you did any co ops if yes then which is best?
Fliping practice is nice. Thanks for showing this and now I will also try this because I also get confused between two things a tone of times.
We wanna see Ken starting a startup.Let's give it a shot ken. And hopefully I will become the vice president of it when it will become a larger company. Haha. Just kidding. By the way your quality of videos is awsome, keep it up
Personally I would not do a data science master degree.. there is no consistency between programs.. if one were to do a stats or CS degree as you go to different schools much of the curriculum is very similar.. electives might be different..
Haha, very true about flipping the coin :) 

I was thinking about doing an extra degree in CS, but it takes a lot of time and after I checked the syllabus...  many of the courses in the degree cover material I am not at all interested in and will not really be useful in the career I want.
I was wondering, why not UI Chicago or IIT Chicago ? 
Btw, great video as usual !  Short and simple, just the right amount of everything :)
Funny, A big reason I chose the school I'm in now was also because I didn't want to take the GRE lol.
I loved the fact that you went to DePaul and started this channel. I'm planning to apply for a masters in DS myself, I've learned a lot about sports analytics on this channel, and I'm hoping to start a channel myself one day :)
Heyy I have seen in linkdin this #66daysofdata with Ken jee can you explain me what does that means?üôÇ
Hi Ken, what are your thoughts on Masters of Business Analytics program? I‚Äôm currently considering that over a Masters of Data Science due to it being more ‚Äúapplicable‚Äù to the corporate world.
Master Master Kenüôè
haha...  Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" comes to mind. I'm mighty glad the decision you made seems to be working pretty fine. You keep some of us going, Ken. Keep being awesome.
Hey Ken,
Love your videos, they are extremely informative.
Currently I am on episode 4 of your Data Science project from scratch series.üòÑ

Can you please share your opinion on the below question, it will be really helpful.

How is the Master's in Data Science program at Northeastern University, Boston?
It's been 5 hours and this video only has 573 views, strange.
I was watching your videos to get more information about Data Science but i fell in love with you ü•∫üò≥
0:00 - 0:28 david blaine MIND FREAK
Both fun and informative video üëçüëçThank you Ken
I think your commerce background IS important as it created one of the biggest filters in your decision making, that is, which school doesn‚Äôt require a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science? I would think that the requirements in Data Science are lower, is that correct?
Do you feel like the masters degree was worth it or could you have gotten where you are now without one? If you come from a technical background, is the MS worth the investment?
Quality video as usual!
Did you know anyone who did their MS in DS at DePaul? I have a friend who is in that program and he said it's worth it but I was wondering if you knew anyone who did the program. I'm really considering doing a Master's in DS since I'm graduating with a BS in Finance from a B+ level school and I feel like I'll need an MS to get a good job in the field (I have bad ADHD and I'm not great at teaching myself things so I don't think the self-taught route is for me). Did you know anyone who did that program? How was their post grad job placement? Do you think the CS program was better?
Your editing skills have really improved since the start of your channel! This was a really well done video. I'd love to know more about how you do it since I'm considering starting a channel of my own. You have an interesting story and it's cool to see how far this channel has progressed. 100k is coming up! See you in the next vid!

(okay so I was going to insert a peace emoji there at the end of my comment but the menu bar on my macbook's keyboard doesn't seem to want to work today....damn.)
Thank you for being a great mentor Master Master Ken, your advice is constantly helping me alot
Brilliant Video Ken!
It was most enlightening that a lot of the decision pruning was purely practical (ie: no BCS requirement; missed a deadline and didn't want to wait another year). Good reminder that we don't live in a perfect world; we live in this one.

(... Also, on behalf of the entire community, please accept our humblest apologies for our dire transgressions, Master Master Kenneth Jee.)

Not a single Stackoverflow window in sight.
Can you also make video about data analyst roadmap and all üíØ
Great video Ken!
Hi Ken,
Great decision-making process. That's how I am going to decide whether to go to grad school or industry.
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope you git it now üòâ

Thanks for you wink ;)
Literally awfull puns
The puns in the intro though.
I'm familiar with git from a software development side.  My question is for data science what do you add/track in your epo?  Do you track the entire working tree so that output files dont need to be regenerated for each contributors (e.g. if you have slow running scripts). It do you only "add" the source data and scripts so that each person needs to run everything in their local copies?
I am from non programming background, I have already started learning about Git and Github commands. Hope this will help me in near future.
Did you leave out mentioning your own github repository on purpose? 
Also, was it an oversite the not mention github's opensource community as a resource?
Ohh!!! I was confused between git and Github, Obviously due to lack of knowledge but now the idea is clear. I will watch this video again while implementation it or when I will actually use git for storing projects. Also thank you for git resources...
Very clear and descriptive Ken!
Thanks as always. what music are you using at 4:07?
Hi Ken, who should be the one that merges the pull request? The person who made the pull quest or the person who reviewed the code?
love the puns lol
After merging all of these concepts with my brain, I'm going to fork your puns in my next video!
Ha ha.... I laughed till death,If i try somehow I will understand quantam physics. But not git. 
I just don't git it.
Big brain jokes right there üòÇ , this video made everything really clear to me ! thank you Ken !
GitHub desktop is friendly and easy for the beginners like me. No need to memorize the command lines. Tend to forget it if not used often.
This was entertaining!  Btw, I saw your name on the DS Go schedule tomorrow! I'm so excited to hear from you there! I'm that GA Data Science recent grad that's been stalking your channel lately :D
What would motivate you if you were a student who just started to learn data science? I am in this position now and i cant find anything to motivate myself. Thats a huge problem for some of us because the other problems like "where can i learn data science" has solutions everywhere. Hope you'll answer. Good content keep it up.
Awesome content as always, thanks for making it simple and straight to the point. It all makes sense now. 

Oh by the way, your video quality is top notch, I just watched this on 2160p(4K) üî•
Thank you for the video, Ken! I am working on my own GitHub repository and I am at the moment working on Data Science projects thanks to your encouragement of #66daysofdata! I shall be completing Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in a few months and I will be sharing them on GitHub as well. I wanted to thank you for your well-tailored, descriptive, and concise yet enriching videos as they are of incredible help and I use them as a road map to becoming a Data Scientist. With your guidance, I hope I end up getting a great job in the USA or Canada, and what I love more about is that you have been so interactive all along! Thank you once again Ken! <3
Please also explain Git Bash to people who use Windows.
Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 
1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn‚Äôt do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice.
2. He‚Äôs using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that‚Äôs the command line interface to use git. It‚Äôs also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it‚Äôs be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don‚Äôt want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 
3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. 
(Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).
Can we git jupyter notebook? I just started learning DS and I only code from jupyter notebook, any recommendation?
Nice video...I have a question what os do you use in work environment like windows/linux/unix?
I GIT IT NOW üòÆ
Best explanation of git I‚Äôve ever watched.
Puns are one of my favorite hobbies, second only to sarcasm ;)
lol the wink
Haha, great video Ken!
Instead of replacing "master" with "main", "git" should just rebrand to "got" since Ken has just told its entire story
great vid! I watched the MIT Git intro lesson about a month ago and it definitely overcomplicated things. I like how this sticks to what commands you are actually going to use
Great to see you BRANCHing out with new types of content.
What do you mean awful puns, I thought they were hilarious ü§£
Had experience with git before and immediately started laughing at your puns from the start ü§£
Man I wish I had seen this sooner, definitely clears up so much. Although,  now I realize I've never actually even worked on git locally and just do all my work(projects) on github, is that okay or should I learn how to use Git locally? 
Also digging the music!
I was looking for something like this! Thanks Ken!!!
To kill a mockingbird üëç
Your pun game is stronger than ever üòÇ
Awesome video as usual very helpful.üëç
Awesome video Ken as usual! I really thought you would end saying "git good" learning Data Science üòÇü§£ :P
Awesome video, love all the 3 puns (git, gist and commit), we git it now üòÉ
Those puns had me rolling, please stop lol
Omg it is very helpful can you like make a tutorial for git hub üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
the puns in the intro are a good measure of how familiar git is! I learned in my workplace how useful git can be for worklflows. I fully recommend it to everyone for projects.

Great step!
"Deep data science" That the best name. It combines Deep learning and Data science together.

How about a little double entendre: ‚ÄúDeep Learning with Ken Jee‚Äù 

Also..


model‚Äôs training
‚ÄúBreaking Through‚Äù your content has really given people a direction as in how to break into the data industry but you also mentioned how you would also include other stuff like human optimization so I think the title  ‚ÄúBreaking Through‚Äù would hand in hand with what you mentioned because there‚Äôs usual always some barrier into something we want to get into whether it‚Äôs a learning barrier or something else
Can't wait!
how about "A podcast of life and data" .... or ... " Life through data and data through life." ... I am not sure, that's all I got so far. Good luck with the new podcast!! :D 
Just be careful not to get too much on your plate ( I should know, I am in the process of entirely rebuilding my life).

Can you do a video (or have you done one) on saturation of junior data scientists in the job market? Do you think the field is growing still and that demand will out over supply for labor in data science?
Already have commented many names in your channel üíØüíØ
Good luck with your new podcast project!
Hi ken, I'm excited for the podcasts. 
I realise this is off topic but I just wanted to hear your thoughts. next year I will be doing a conversion course into data science and AI (with a year in industry) as I am doing a masters in Uni. I had an undergrad in sports science so I relate to you. So I have a year and a lot of spare time to prepare, what do you recommend I learn ahead of time? coding? SQL? Building a portfolio or what?

Hey Ken! Have you seen the learning paths available from Microsoft for Azure like AI Edge and many others. And also those available from Amazon for AWS. I was wondering what's your opinion about those resources and whether it'd be useful to spend time with them?
Congrats Ken, can't wait to check out your podcast!
One thing I neglected to mention is that part of impostor syndrome is that you feel like you're going to get "found out". Luckily people usually a lot more wrapped up in their own insecurities than they are in exposing yours! Thanks for watching everyone!

The simplest solution is doing the work. If you can make something work, then you are that smart. If not , you aren't.  Beyond that ,its difficult to deal with, as it becomes a sort of gray area.
Feynman put it best. " I'm smart enough to know how dumb I am"
The first second of this video describes my life lol
I am yet to break in this filed, but I totally get you. I really like to learn new things and this field is full of surprises. I love it.
I feel quite insecure when trying out a new project from Kaggle and feel that I am just copying others and not doing anything unique. What would you suggest as a method by which I can overcome this insecurity and push myself forward?
Thanks for sharing Ken. This is very familiar feeling. That is why I have guilt feeling that i havent spent enough time working even though I've been coding and learning 10-12 hours daily.
Keep up sharing great content üëå
I never have any problem with this feeling as long as i am working like crazy and learning new stuff but if i take a break for 2 days or sometimes even few hours, it kicks in and motivates me to work even harder. I like it. Doesn't let me get comfortable with what i know.
Yeah I kinda didn‚Äôt deal with my imposter syndrome in the healthiest way,... I tried to just learn absolutely everything before applying for internships as an undergrad. I would just sit and cram and learn stuff thay most interns as an undergrad wouldn‚Äôt need to know going in.
Got this video on feed and it was a divine timing . 
Ps: we have same glasses üòÇüíØ‚úåÔ∏è
Thanks for this video. Being rejected during many past interviews led to me having similar feelings of imposter syndrome despite past success.
I am an SAP Business warehouse developer that uses the SAPs proprietary language ABAP but exposure to coding limited to work exposure. SAP's stock tanked 30% since it missed the cloud bus and it has kind of given me a pinch of diversification. Does it make sense to invest in learning Datascience and switch gears?
I think it's time for you to create patreon and youtube subscriptions!
Which data structures would you recommend knowing the ins and outs of for a data science interview as opposed to a software engineering interview? So far I‚Äôve been focusing on arrays and recursion, and eventually want to get into graph algorithms.
Thomas Edison says: I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.

So to anyone who is reading this: keep pressing on!
I work as a data scientist already, I wanted to know how to get clients on my own to work on data science products, I feel that a lot of middle management don't convey the right idea about data science hence I want to see if I could start my own consultancy on getting projects, I wanted to know how is it possible?
Loosing, Failures, Doubt just have fun enjoy them... 
It's not atom bomb üí£
Thanks for bringing awareness to this. You've been such an awesome mentor and educator!!!! We all have those moments, imposter syndrome sucks :/ Keep making awesome videos!!
Ken, I wouldn't sweat it. I don't see it as you giving me advice (which if I were in your position, I would feel it overwhelming and with a lot of responsibility). The way I see it, it is that by you sharing your life experiences and other people experiences, when you do the interviews, your are providing me with invaluable information. I think, it is MY responsibility to take the information that you provide as an advice or just as interesting information.
I appreciate all the effort that you put into researching the topic and putting it in an understandable manner. 
By the way, I got the point of your video, that is embraced it and grow with it. 
Thanks for your channel!

I have never seen so long meaningful comments in any YouTube video ever. Seriously Ken Jee you are showing the power of truth and doubt (‚ùî )
Great video as usual, smashed it and its not only applicable for data science, I think alot of what you said applies in life. If the smartest man in the world Socrates said "I know that I know nothing" what makes anyone think they know everything.
You are the lamb bearer in a really Dark tunnel. 

It is upto people to follow your advice or not. 

People like me who follow your advice really admire you.
bro i wanna give you a hug
This was a cool video!  Thanks
Man mad respect for opening up on this subject.

Cheers from Bolivia
Very power message, thanks!
I needed that! Thanks for sharing and appreciate all that you do for us!
I wanted to ask you what framework or editor will be the best to learn Python. I want to start learning this language but I wasn't sure how to do so. I saw some videos using Sublime Text and Django but as a beginner I will like to have this big-small advise.
"We fail more then we success"  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) 

I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a "real scientist" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.

One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...

As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.

The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.

I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.

I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)
Thank you so much for this video! It resonated so much with me. I usually get these waves of insecurity aka imposter syndrome although it's always lurking in shadows. I have learned to just  keep going and try to be honest about what I know and do not know. I have been told that I should be more confident though üò¨
Ken been acting kind of sus.  I think he vented! haha great video as always!
I am just a beginner in this field, still trying to adapt data science and ML and whenever I see my friends around me who are also doing the same thing but almost most of them had already started 6 months prior to  me and they're doing so good. I doubt that if I will ever be able to learn all these concepts. :|
I'm always doubting of my skills lol
Thank you Ken, this type of videos - honest talk - really helps! Bests.
letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.
Me: "Wow I am seriously unqualified for this position......

better apply!" ü§°
Okay but in all seriousness, thank you for your honesty on this one. I think you spoke to what a lot of us are feeling & it's great to know none of us are ever alone on this :)
also.......can we or can we not get a #66DaysofData Among Us game night one of these days?!
As a beginner, I've had this feeling for the past 6 months, when I look at job offers there is always one or two or plenty of things that I'm not familliar with at all .. but you have made it easier for me to improve myself each day through your videos and tutorials, and hopefully I will land an internship in the next 2 months.
After 2-3 years experience, I have a strategy for dealing with imposter syndrome. Keep a reading/to-learn list, with techniques, frameworks or anything data science related. As soon as you feel a spell of imposter syndrome coming, learn something asap and don't stop learning until you feel better again
Thanks for opening up , actually after seeing this video i felt so much better it's like you express the doubts inside my head all this time , and honestly, i believe you are doing a good job, at least there are a lot of things i ve learned through your videos
Great video and topic Ken! I think everyone feels this to an extent. Super important to be humble and modest, although confidence is key too!
I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. "Shouldn't this be easier?", "How does anyone understand this", or "The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks. I don't know what to do about that, we are finite creatures after all.
I feel like in the technology field Impostor Syndrome has just become a consistent feeling a lot of people develop..I remember doing my Bachelor's for CS and constantly feeling inadequate or inferior by comparison to my peers cause I felt like my coding abilities in comparison to theirs were terrible..That got heightened when it came to applying for jobs and getting rejections all throughout college...Ironically the one thing that kind of got me out of my own head when it came to that feeling was Data Science..I found a genuine passion for wanting to do it and that kind of helped me subvert the Imposter Syndrome I felt from coding at least...Now I'm in my first semester of going after my Data Science Masters and I still feel that Impostor Syndrome looking at how qualified my peers are by comparison and questioning my own abilities yet again but also having gone through it the first time around I realize a lot of that is just me being in my own head....similar to how you've embraced it over the years...Thanks for posting about this Ken...You, DataLeap and the Data Professor have become my go to channels to watch ever since I started my Data Science journey 2 months ago and hearing that you feel that level of doubt in your own life even with how much of a great figure you are in the Data Science community is honestly kind of relieving to know......
This approach to the imposter syndrome is really needed and might be a truly helpful for many. Thank you for this Ken Jee
I‚Äôm new to the field. I feel like I know absolutely nothing, but I‚Äôm going into a master of Data Science because I truly want to do AI/ML work. I don‚Äôt have a traditional CS background, so this is all scary. When did everyone get comfortable with the AI/ML coding interview and overall interview process?
I'm glad that you don't use background music anymore üôè
Hey Ken, I think this video is important because for the last decade or more, life has been shown through rose tinted glasses and instagram filters. Being real with people is exactly what (I) people need I think, especially in this bogus job market. Thanks. Have a good weekend.
while imposter syndrome is self-focused, it is inherently comparative -- trust yourself and what YOU bring to the table :) everyone is on a journey here, and NO ONE knows it all
Honestly, I started being more organized in the field of Data Science when I started following your contents and your supports. I still remember myself few months back when I don't know how to write a good resume and how to organize my GitHub projects and LinkedIn profile. Without your regular updates and supports I would never be here, no doubt. Personally, I am so thankful for your support and you have done great things for us, Ken.
Keep up the good work! Your content is very helpful. Impostor syndrome is real and I am finding lot of people are talking about it via YouTube. Thanks for creating suggestions on how to overcome the insecurities.
I need to learn programming first then I can give it a shot. Thanks fo4 the video.
impostor)
Nice video titile!  On the current wave
Thanks for opening up and talking about this Ken. Just know you‚Äôre helping many Data Science newbies like myself learn and love the field. Keep it up!
Your Content is Exactly what I need in my life.
the syndrome got worse after i started playing among us
Sounds like some among us theory

So from what I hear, self taught is not necessarily a bad thing in data analytics?
Really fun interview to watch! Thanks for sharing your background and tips that made you as successful as you are!
Glad that I listened since I was being overwhelmed with choosing PowerBI vs Tableau‚ò∫Ô∏è. I'll probably stick with one & have already started to know basic of it.
I agree with the passion-argument. When someone is passionate about their work, they will find a way to improve, even if it may be difficult.
üî•üî•üî• awesome interview!
Thanks, ken for sharing another great and interesting interview...
It's great interview, Ken. Thanks for sharing with us.
Who would have thought Jack Black got into analytics.
Waiting for that data science tinder tutorial to drop
Great conversation! More people need to understand ROI!!!
Consistent quality content from Ken Jee as always. This also came at a time where I‚Äôve been doubling down on learning sql coz I‚Äôm looking to break into tech with a data analytics job. Thank you both for this content! üéâ
Thank you for this!
Another great interview from thee ken jee!
Nice üòéüî•
Thanks Ken for another great video, great insights into data analytics from John David

Hey, Ken!
In another video you adviced against putting your picture on your resume. One of the reasons is that it may hinder the efficiency of screening apps.

You advice against putting icons on the resume too? for example, the icons in https://d.novoresume.com/images/blogs/55839c90-6d75-11e8-9ca8-6d365b13efdc/it-resume.png
Hi Ken, I'm newly transitioning into the data science field and am wondering how to approach building a data science resume if none of my work experience is in data science or tech. I've listed several projects, skills, and certifications, but should I also put work experience even if it's unrelated? how would you recommend a  beginner resume like this be structured?
How can we submit a resume for review?
Haha it was really interesting to take a look at Tina's resume :D
With this series, one always finds optimization potential in one's resume!
Please can you make video on this "How to choose algorithm for machine learning".
Hey Ken! Another video idea for the pile: a video on the maths you need to do data science and the best places to learn it. I've been slowing working my way through the Mathematics for Machine Learning textbook and it's hard work for someone who never did maths outside of high school.
These keep getting more fun! ‚ù§Ô∏è Im also so glad that people are finding them helpful üòÑ
Hello, I don't know if you remember the other day when I asked about the automated tennis video analysis. I have been doing some research and I found some research papers and even a thesis with that system I am trying to do. Is it illegal to apply it using OpenCV or some library? Can I use a bit or do I have to do everything from scratch?
Hey Ken, I have an option of staying at a medium size school and continuing as a business major, or going to UT Austin and doing Liberal Arts. Which do you think is better for a Data Science career?
Learnt a lot ü§£üòÉ wow
Hey Ken, I‚Äôm really enjoying this series, I just have a quick question. If I was crunched on space in fitting all the projects I‚Äôve done, would you say it‚Äôs better to keep your most recent projects on your resume OR would you rather advise to keep the projects that are relevant to the position/company you are applying to although it‚Äôs been 2-3 years since you‚Äôve worked on that specific project?
Thanks for another great resume review! It gave me a lot of ideas of how I can improve my own resume.
hey ken , should we describe the personal projects we did in the resume or just mentioning them with an understandable name is enough? thanks
great helpful  video 
can I also send you my resume  for review  on the next video ?
Ken, I'm a huge fan of your channel! I think you're providing an incredible service to aspiring data scientists. The insight you provide is so valuable, even in careers beyond data science. I'm doing my PhD in Chemistry but I've really taken an interest in data science over the past few months. Right now I've been applying machine learning to help develop low-cost COVID diagnostic platforms in our laboratory. I still have a lot to learn but who knows, maybe one day you'll be reviewing my resume!
Now every algorithms works in order to show what we want to watch say YouTube, Google Ads etc.. So sir my question is doesn't it makes us less interested in exploring new things. What if algorithms only shows content based on our past results and never lets us know new things. Suppose i don't have any idea what is deep learning and even didn't hear it before. So how it is likely that one will get to know about it, just by recommendation system or any other search result. 

Sorry it might sounds weird üò¨
Hey Ken, random question. Do you know if Python 3.9 is supported on Anaconda yet? I can't seem to get my environment variable working :(
Thank you Ken and Tina!  

100K is getting closer and closer :)
You guys should take the WORKERA exam by deeplearning.ai to see how your skills compare to each other and us in Data Science and Machine Learning. Would be a fun video
It was certainly fun watching this resume review üòä 1 Beepbeepboop St üòÜ

Hey Ken. What would the best approach be if I already have a project but am just getting started with Python programming?¬†
On conversing with a data scientist one time, I was told it was a deep learning problem. I am confused if I should learn what's necessary for this project or approach it like everyone else?
Does the building a web app require another language besides python?
Hey Ken! Please make one video on hyperparamter tuning for random forest classifier.

I think you forgot something...
#NoPapayasWereHarmed
I like the last project ideas. :) It's nice how you start from scrapping and data analysis and end with AI ;)

What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool? 

How is it with using youtube data for data science projects? I'm not talking about downloading videos - I'm interested in comments, video titles and thumbnails. Intuitively it should be ok to use those... 

Edit: I should watch the videos of the projects you reviewed for inspiration.
Hi Ken, love your videos. Got a question for web scrapping tho. Maybe I'm missing it, but what should I be looking out for in the robots.txt about scraping? I pulled up the glassdoor one on my own, but not sure which line says to not scrape. Maybe I'm missing it or don't really know what to look for.
What is the best tool for webscraping
Ken really nailing it with the accessories here ;D
The last point really made me smile, because my largest ML project yet also utilizes embedded devices, so that was a good amount of positive reinforcement!
Next project: build a web app that smashes the like button.
Or you can collect your personal life data (aka self-tracking) and then analyze it like I do - www.measuredme.com

I think Ken Jee youtube is on fire. I start watching when the subscriber is below than 5k and now almost hit 100k. Keep updating KJ, and I am waiting for the end-to-end project using Docker or Kubernetes.
Hi Ken, I am a international student studying  masters in information systems  in US, I wanted to know if companies look for machine learning , artificial intelligence subjects in the course (I've subjects on basic R , data mining& SQL)... Can you please tell me if it's still possible to land internship/job on the basis of projects. Thank you!
I was really expecting you to eat all the papayas
Durians instead of mangos!
looks like someone has been enjoying the sun haha
Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA. Great content.
Pivoting my career interests to data science has recently sparked an idea for a startup I might want to pursue one day in the near future ü§ê
Hello ken, need a video on ' How a real-life data science project looks like, how they gather data, how they process it etc.', what are the tools used by industry. A glimpse of a real-world data science project is required to attain the necessary skills.
Guess who just recovered from Covid 19 üòé. 
Great content.
I really like these ideas! This video motivates me to learn more and be creative:)
First time scraping data, I did not took  into account the effect that would have on the site, requested over 11k urls without any pause between the requests. Two days later i went to the site to manual check some data and they had severely restricted my IP, I could request a url every 10 minutes or so.
Great video Ken! Now that's a lot of papayas. Web app that smashes the like button, I like that! üòÜ
Ken embracing the papaya! Meme quality 9000+

My dad knew a guy who worked at his company whose version of "the model's training" was "it's cooking." Well, after about 8 months of "cooking" with nothing to show for it, he was fired.
Bravo.....üòÇSitting on the floor to ground my thoughts...üòÇby the way nice videoü§ü
"what do you mean I can't do this with a jupyter notebook?" üòÇ
LMFAO I SAY MODELS TRAINING TOO MUCH
To be honest naming your child Leigh Techkkkkq is still a better idea then calling them Latex and insisting that's not how you pronounce it haha (0:37)
Love it
Fucking legend
I laughed so FREAKINNG hard when he said ‚Äúwe extract signal from the noise‚Äù
PPT vs Latex OMG XD
"The model's training" is the new "The program's compiling".
DUDE THATS SO TRUE!

Everytime my model is training, i check the phone for messages or memes and it is aways when someone passes by and sees me giggling and looking at the phone. 

I feel embarassed
"Who calls it BIG DATA anymore" - BEST
I am watching with out coding. 

Yeaaah, the model is training.
"I actually prefer to sit on the floor"...10 seconds later..."You still code sitting down?" üòÇ Funny even for non data-scientists
what is a dog fish api? I know the jokes a reference but I still dont get it. Can someone help me out?
This is the good one Ken Jee and btw my model is still in training.üòÇ
Latexkhkhkh lol
How about you guys do on what interviewers say to junior Data scientists. Do u know know numpy ,scipy, random forest, neural networks. Can you do this task for us for free cos we can't figure out how to do it but we wont get back to you after the 3rd round or reply oh sorry we need someone with 8 years experience for the entry level position but damn you can code. I will just clone all your projects, there are a lot of useful staff here ,oh by the way we gave the job to this dude he is really good at using Excel.
hahaha this 0:21 haha this is what I want to tell recruiters every time ü§£
watching this video while I'm running my model..lol
Forgot 'I give meaning to data'
This was my watch for day number 1 of my #66DaysOfData 




Nah jk but I'm sure I learned something lmao
Now you HAVE TO make a "Model's training..." T-shirt üòÜ
Hey Ken I don't know if you remember me  (freshman (well now a sophomore tho) economics student in Turkey). I just got an internship and learned python besides R and keep working. :))
I bet that will make more sense after I get some work experience :) on that point, how to prepare for a data science intervju?
I watched this video while my model was training.
HAHAH the model's always training tbh
from api to ipa we all grew up
Fake, not arrogant enough ;)
I'm not a data scientist but next time my wife looks at me sideways for spending too much time doing nothing, my response will most definitely be: Yea the model's training!
ü§£ü§£ü§£
You should do this more‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea.
Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.
Hello Ken, thanks for the video. I've been following you since you were 5000 subs, but I had never seen your resume and I didn't know you started on data science because you were a golfer. I am a tennis player and I have been searching a lot about data science and I would like to start applying it on my tennis game. I saw an app called SwingVision that does the statistic by its own, but unfortunately is just for Ios and I just have android. I would like to get a free software or build one. Do you know any? If not, what would I have to learn to build a software like that? Thanks for your help
Good Work Mate!
Thanks, Ken, for this!
This was a helpful video!
This really shows that having a strong network is incredibly valuable.
üëèüëèüëè Always  making the best videos Ken Sensei.
I am headed for #4! Ken Jee, thank you for your great content!
Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. 

These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.

When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.  These people have good money to pay and they know it. PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together.
This is great advice!! üí™üí™

Hi Ken, been following  you for quite some time now and I'm amazed to see the content quality in your videos. No matter what video I watch, I learn something. Awesome job!! Would you consider posting a Data Science tutorial from the scratch on your channel? May be a paid subscription? There are so many courses out there, when I try to find one that'll help me I always get confused. Basically I don't trust them and I think it'll help a lot of people if you start teaching data science. Either way, your AWESOME!
Awesome, Probably the best video on landing a data science job! 
P.S. The new mechanical keyboard looks great, I'll find something similar, like the pounding feel while smashing the space bar or enter buttons üòÉ
How and where can I contact recruiters?
Hi, Ken! I‚Äôm a second-year college student from the Philippines. I like your bonus content! I‚Äôm all down applying for one prolly by early November. Thank you for helping us, aspiring data scientists!
Hey Ken,
I'm graduating this fall from my university and working really hard on a bunch of projects, my thesis, and networking with professors who could refer me to data science roles. Nonetheless I constantly feel inadequate compared to pHD students and others I meet, do you think it is possible to get into a data science job right now with just my bachelor's?
Much Love From Iran.
Nice video Ken!!
I completely agree with you on doing data science Internships. 
I  did 2  Data Science related Internships during my undergrad and recently grabbed a Entry level Data Science job and those small experiences helped me uplift my Profile.
Again Thanks Ken for such lovely guidance!! Big fan.
Hey im a freshman in college and i have a intrest in econ and and stats,  rn im majoring in computer but really not enjoying coding projects. Do you recommend switching my major to stats and econ or sticking with cs

Cool tips Ken
How Much Math do I need in Data Science?
Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning
 
I. Introduction

If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:

Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?

What essential math skills are important in data science?

There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:

    Ggplot2
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Caret
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras

Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It‚Äôs important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.
II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model

Let‚Äôs suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:

How big is my dataset?

What are my feature variables and target variable?

What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?

What features are important?

Should I scale my features?

How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?

What is principal component analysis (PCA)?

Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?

How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?

How can I improve the predictive power of the model?

Should I use regularized regression models?

What are the regression coefficients?

What is the intercept?

Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?

What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?

Without a sound math background, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.

Let‚Äôs now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning.
III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning
1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye‚Äôs Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function
3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors
4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)
IV. Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we‚Äôve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.
I love strategy #5. Sometimes it's all about who you know.

It's never too late to make connections! Dust off that LinkedIn profile and start messaging recruiters and employees at the company you want to work at. 

You'd be surprised at the opportunities you can make for yourself just by simply introducing yourself :)
Hey Ken, I'm eagerly waiting for your another end to end project.
I'm the new follower of you. First comment. I hope that I'll be learning some helpful and great skills from you.
Thx for the insights, Ken!
What‚Äôs a project? Do first-author scientific papers count? Lol that‚Äôs all I have
Why there is 3 clocks?ü§î
thanks for doing this
This is absurd..  It reminded me of chandler's sex face in FRIENDS.  Just joking. Great thumbnail for both a smash the like button and a break the interview kinda stuff..
Awesome video again ken !!
Love the thumbnail!
Thanks for the video.
Another great video from Ken, well done!
Do you ever plan to make videos where you actually do some data science ever again?
Gems for days!
first?

I loved this episode, I'm trying to learn more about creating effective data Viz and this episode was a gold mine into a little tips that improve that
This is very helpful! Thanks!
This video made me more aware of the importance of building my personal brand. My weekly sharing at maimai (local social medium like linkedin in China has lasted 5 months. I did not realized it has been so long until today. Just keep it as a habit. 
I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over 10 years. I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future. Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry. That's why I started my sharing of AI, big data analysis, the driven power behind IT industry, 5G, block chain. The highest number of views are 100~200, still far away from those popular posts which got thousands of views. I'm not discouraged because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. So I will keep making my efforts.
Great video as usual Ken, Thanks for the video, Try interviewing these amazing people: Kiril iremnko - Jose Portilla - Jon Kron - DJ Patil
Just awesome content i am fresh grad from BIS and i am going for data science .. few people in Egypt know the concept as it's the hot trend the next years ‚ô•Ô∏è
Never commented before but I really want to thank you, Ken, for your videos! You've helped me a lot on my Data Science journey. We appreciate your hard work! Hello from Russia :)
I follow both of your contents regularly and this was such an amazing episode!
Inspiring interview!
Daily exposure and "just putting yourself out there" definitely helped me on my journey as well.
I did not hear about MakeOverMonday but I just looked at it and it really seems like an awesome resource.
Really enjoy this series! Great insight for a data science student like myself! Cheers from Singapore!
Ken when are you going to make a video of stock price prediction you've been studying for a while... I'll love to learn.
Or you can just share some of the materials you're using
Thank You Ken, Always to Direct us.
Thank you, Ken, for sharing...üôÇ
Thanks for another awesome interview! I really enjoyed learning about the importance of data visualization.
Hello Ken and Kate! Love the energy, candid discussion and authentic personality that shines. I am signed up for the conference Kate. It should be fun.
Recently started learning Data Science took one course in Udemy...
Ken Jee please suggest me some good  online platform from which I can get certified. Looking forward for your reply.
"Great work, keep it up"  16:10 these are so helpful to keep up morale, but I often find that the constructive criticism is one of the best, free ways to grow and challenge yourself. Love Kate's energy and expertise, professionally interviewed by Ken!
Great interview Ken and Kate!  Always love watching these.
Thank you Ken, you're making my move from an accountant to a data scientist much more structured and informed.
You guys are awesome! Auto subbed to Kate‚Äôs channel ‚úîÔ∏è
Wow! Between this new Channel, Andrew from Dataleap , AI from with Alexx, and your channel ... I do have a lot of youtube videos aligned ... that is when my current NLP projects and computer vision one leave me some time, which does happens don't worry ;)
Very informative video‚ò∫Ô∏è

Watched these when I was making my own resume for internships. Super helpful.
Hi @Ken jee 
Could I get my resume reviewed? I have made changes to my resume after watching your video & I bet you'd love to see the changes & also would like to get more suggestions on the current one.
Would like to hear your thoughts on this 
https://www.careercup.com/resume
Sir my dataset has 35k observation. Should I start doing analysis using entire dataset or should I first select sample out of it. Because I do not know what should be the better number of observation should a sample dataset have ?
Ken you are really an expert on reviewing resumes
Two of my favourite creators join to help the community out with resume reviews; awesome collaboration! :)
This is good! Showing instead of telling!  I'm curious what to do for myself though.  I have a DS degree and worked 2 DS jobs, but neither involved any modeling (DS or otherwise).  An old boss thinks I should focus on business value delivery and skip the personal DS modeling projects.  What do you think?
Which is best for android app development by using ML (flutter/odoo)
Thank you so much, Ken as well as Tina. You guys are doing great and it's really helpful for me and many more.
This is so cool! An awesome initiative ken and tina. Thanks :)
Yay first episode!! I'm so excited for this series because I think people are going to get a lot of value from watching us review super diverse data science resumes and apply what they learn to elevate their own resumes. 
It's always so much fun doing videos with you! Also I'm a little late but CONGRATS ON 90K! Almost ready to celebrate 100k üòÑ
Loved the video! I am a recent subscriber and collegiate student who is an aspiring data scientist as well. I contacted you via email about the potential to review my resume/work via YouTube. Thank you so much for your terrific videos; they've helped me tremendously! :)
That's really insightful video on resume and  I am glad to share that I also started a computer club in college to develop strong coding community as sir Ken Jee started a sport analytics club.
Please collab Ken sir  with tina and data professor in your upcoming videos ?
My topic suggestion: "noob to data scientist end to end guide"
I‚Äôm so grateful that the YouTube algorithm led me to this channel.
Great video, I heard from someone in the Data Science industry that some robots checking resumes are messed up with having a 2 columns resume, so the candidates should have one column resume, I am not sure if you heard that.
Thank you so much! I have to say that Hari's internships weren't real internships but virtual internships, meaning he wasn't actually hired. Would you still put them above projects? And would you put them as experience? Bc I think it could look misleading. Thank you!!!
This new Resume Review series is super cool! 10:27 Modeling, That's a good one Ken!
Congrats on passing 90k subs, Ken! Great variety of resumes, Tina and Ken - how many review requests do you have in the backlog? Excited for episode 2!
Well done Ken and Tina!
Thankyou for sharing your valuable knowledge with us
Out of curiosity, all Indian resumes..?
Super good advice.  I liked Tina‚Äôs comment about how to write your project section,  the three lines being:
1. Description
2. Skills used
3. Outcome/results/impact 

Great simple way to show you know your stuff and show you know how to communicate in a way business stakeholders understand.
What should i do to make career on Data Science.

Hi Ken Jee, can you please make one project for each type, so that we can get an idea of each type?
It was a very eye-opening content for me. When I look back at the past, I remembered that I was already doing some projects, but I also saw that I did not think deeply while I was doing any of them. For example, when I was estimating house price, I realized that, as you said, I didn't give much thought to how much influence the links between different data points have on the price of a house. But data science is a journey and some fails can be seen like flowers around the road LoL :))
Why do you show the nature, trees , sea  instead of a computer screen)), when you talk about these projects show at least their sources, tools, open code source as an example to use.
thank you so much
thank you so much
This sounds more like supervised and unsupervised learning, rather than data science
Your description of project 2 spit out a bunch of terms I'm not familiar with at all... I had to turn on captions to be sure I was hearing you right.  Guess I'm making flashcards.
Hi Ken! Can u post the link to the push-up counting project? I would like to learn more abt that! Thank  in advance :)
is it too late for starting DS at the age of 28 ?
is it too late to start DS at the age of 28 ?

Project on EDA, can we add this project in our resume/portfolio in order to applying for some data science position?
Excellent useful video. Thanks!
Absolutely love your content! It's so helpful :)
Definitely doing it.
Whenever I feel like questioning my decision to learn Datascience I came back to your videos. 
I don't know if it's progress but I now know roughly whatever projects you're talking in this video. That what kind of projects they actually are. So, maybe it is actually progress. Fingers crossed ü§ûü§û
Wooooo... That model of counting push-up is interesting. As there is a lot to learn in data science field but at the same time due to it's diversity a confusion is there. What are your thoughts about ML, AI, Data Science... Are these different or interconnected or it's just different names to one field???
Thanks for the video !! super helpful!! and love the sport examples !
Very intriguing!  When you got to the golfing section, it gives me hope that once I get my master's in data science I will actually be able to combine data science with exercise science. My master's in exercise science may not be so useless after all!
amazing channel man, great content
Thank youüôÇ
Order out of chaos:  Embracing Volatility: Using ML to Become More Efficient Amid Epic Uncertainty [A22219] - Thanks Ken for the videos to help us get started in AI/ML.

Working with deep learning, it's a good way I get to know more about its fundamentals and definitely there are goona be great takeaways from this session.

Thank You. Keep Growing!
Multi-instance GPU (MIG) Best Practices  for Deep Learning Training and Inference
Genomes to GPUs!
I would like to attend  "NVIDIA Inception Premier Showcase - The Top AI Startups in Europe [A22225]"
Hello ken ! I'm doing Data science since 1 month and did 2-3 projects, 1 with deployment. I have confusion related to math part.
I don't find my self or youtubers doing math in there projects, what they do is just important libraries and perform maths task such Linear regression, mse, mean , median and so on.. 
I'm literally very much confused , do i have to solve maths problems by hand or just understand the formulas (how they work)?
Session: Solving Critical Data Science Problems with Container-based Platforms (Presented by Hewlett Packard Enterprise) [A22345]
You're breakdown in the description is extremely helpful. The only thing that could make the vid better would be to give visual examples during the discussion. Thanks!
interested in "Scalable GPU-Accelerated Recommender Systems [A21350] "
It would really help me if I can attend the Instructor Led Workshop " Fundamentals of Deep Learning " . I've  been training myself for quiet some time on Deep Learning and Machine Learning Model Developments. Also I am a Applied Statistics student so not much of a CS background. I think, attending this conference would really boost up my understanding of the sectors and motivate me for a further journey.

P.S: Love your channel, keep doing what you're doing. All the best.
Hello, Ken! Thanks for another great video. Do you know good material about creation pipelines and custom gridsearch, that a beginner will understand? Or maybe you have a video about it on channel?
Thank you for the invaluable content! Your channel is very helpful. Please continue to develop these kinds of detailed and actionable videos. 

Im interested in attending 'get the highest inference performance using TensorRT'
Thank you for this video. I recently started in DS and i've been seeking for projects to build a portfolio.
Thanks for another great video Ken! Definitely a must watch video for all aspiring data scientists wanting to break into the field. üòÉ
I'm just commenting for the free tickets
I want to see "Genomes to GPUS"
It‚Äôs would be amazing to join the session about building intelligent recommender systems
I'd like to join How High-Performance Cloud and Supercomputing are Shaping UAE‚Äôs Digital Future [A22142] session. Thank you :)
Since I am very much into the health care domain if I get a chance I would love to attend the session named as 
GeoCOV: Toward Real-time Analytics and Cartography for Covid Geospatial Data with Machine Learning Algorithms [A22048].
Great logical sequence on how to build the portfolio. I especially liked the first project (Explanatory Data Analysis 0:58) about working with messy data and ideally scraping your own dataset together. I wrote a medium article around this topic and hope that maybe some of you find it useful to go a bit more into detail about this part: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-step-by-step-guide-for-creating-an-authentic-data-science-portfolio-project-aa641c2f2403
Great video as always sensei ken!
Really nice suggestions for data science projects !!!
I would be really interested in attending the deep learning sessions.
Great vid! Would love to attend the recommendation system's conference on the 6th.
The ABC of Data Science Projects:

-Analysis
-Build something advanced
-Classification
-Clustering
-Regression

I know I might have cheated a tiny bit with the second entry and regression might have slipped of just a tiny bit of the "ABC"-edge but outliers are common in DS anyway so it's a perfect, scientifically proven analogy (fact).
I am most interested in the Deep learning mystified session.
Thank you
I would most look forward to: GeoCOV: Toward Real-time Analytics and Cartography for Covid Geospatial Data with Machine Learning Algorithms [A22048]

Admittedly I haven't been able to browse all 337 scheduled sessions, but this one resonates with me as I'm finishing up a 9month internship this coming week where I have been learning a lot about spatial data.

Whilst I'm commenting - Thank you very much for all of your awesome videos! I rarely see people walking through the business side to their projects - your videos have been very helpful :D

Hey Ken, I'm back to pick your brain and get your insight again lol. For deploying machine learning models, what cloud service is most used in the industry? Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use. 

I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it? Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient 

Thanks if you see this and all the amazing work you do! :D
Hey Ken. Data science college student in my final year of study. I'm pretty interested in attending the "Delivering AI to the Defense Intelligence Enterprise: A Discussion of Strategy." Particularly, I'm curious to see if they'll explain the sort of breakthroughs happening in AI/defense as well as whether or not they touch on the ethics of such a technology. For example, using a drone to identify enemy soldiers, etc.

Do they do it for internships too?
I have heard that software engineering position in India are quite different than in other countries, especially when it comes to employee treatment and pay. If that is the case, I am not too sure the Sharpest Minds model will work in India unless the client was looking to move to another location.
Haha, the part at the beginning really got me! :D
There is some truth to this, it is just like overfitting a model but in a different way.
Interesting interview for sure :D
#KenJeePodcast
Hi Ken, Do you play fantasy football of premier league?
Great Video Mr. Jee. I have one question, he talks a lot about A/B testing. Can you describe what that means for a beginner data scientist like myself?
Thanks for having Jeremie on, Ken!
I actually wanted to ask an question that i am currently doing stats as my classwork and i am pretty much enjoying with along with some algebra. But i wanted to know that is calculus and others math are cruciel? I am not good at it
When sharpestminds.com will be launching in india?
Amazing interview! My only feedback would be add timestamps to the video/description outlining of each of the topics discussed. Would be helpful if I wanted to come back and re-listen to a part of the interview.
Really enjoyed this awesome discussion between Jeremie and you Ken! Learned a lot, especially liked the perspectives from the physics and entrepreneurship point of views on approaching data science. üòÉ
Wow, I also studied physics at university:) Great guest and cool interview
I wish life saw stepwise regression .......
Interesting analogy relating gradient descent and entrepreneurship by Jeremie! 
Not the first one saying this but it would be great if Sharpest Minds opened up in India and other developing countries.
Data Science Jay and I were just talking about this unique space, awesome to hear from Jeremie and Ken (as always)
I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry-level data analyst job. All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals. My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now.  I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL. I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course. How much longer will it take for me to land an entry-level data analyst job? I am doing what I can to not have to take out more student debt for a CS degree.
Hello Jeremie Harris, 
Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India. We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take. To be practical or theory. 
Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical. I end up really end doing absolute nothing.
I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India. 
Thanks  
Piyush Talele
SharpestMinds, the team and company, are both truly amazing and really the best mentorship programs in this space.
Only request to them would be to expand to India soon üôÇ
I remember hearing about this on Kiril‚Äôs podcast SDS
first view! first like and the very first comment
Which website did he use to make portfolio
I am currently working on my projects, and i have a question,

Do the projects needs to be full stack? Or just the notebook, and a detailed report of the analysis and model? Because i feel like it takes a lot of time actually building the apps and deploying them. Thank you in advance!
The Q/A session at the last was very important. Got the answer to my own question about beginners projects. Thanks for answering that question Ken.
I totally agree with you Ken.....people really need to focus on the business results vs. techniques used or programming code. Businesses hire people to solve problems, generate sales, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, etc. All of these things can be quantified to some degree. At a minimum, put some focus on how your project adds value to the organization. Position yourself as not just a data scientist or ML engineer, but also a value-add problem solver and business advisor. You're not in academia, you're in business.
Very good advice, I like the honest, detailed responses. Will definitely be dropping you a message when I get some more work done! - mechanical engineer
Very instructive video, thanks !
Thanks for this video, Ken.
Can you please walk us through the Data-domain (Data Scientist/Data Engineer/Data Analyst) recruitment process in one of ur videos?

I am doing my undergrad in Computer Sc. Engineering. The campus-recruitment at my university is more Dev-intensive, focused on coding, Data-structures and Algorithms... could you suggest me something?
Thanks. Ciao!
hi Ken, really helpful video! Do you have any examples of how to include Github and Git into my routine? (you mentioned it at the end of the video). Do i just focus on getting my project on github or focus on how to store it and present it (if thats the case, is there a tutorial on it or would you be interested in doing some tutorials?). Or is it something totally different. 
Keep up the good work!
A great video with so much knowledge and handy pick up things to improve for oneself. That portfolio looks smooth, any possibility you might do another video on portfolio building (feat data professor)? Would love it!
Guys how to make "skills enclosed in the box" eg. Python, Keras? Check 3:49. Those look so awesome!. How to make them in LibreOffice?  Help!

Thanks, Ken Jee for the sharing another awesome video! His clean and neat CV is something I want to make on my own. Is there any paid/non-paid platform where I can make the CV in similar template?
Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume. 

Project A - Kaggle: 
- finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts 

Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: 
-Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping 
-Clean the data 
-Do some advanced feature engineering with the data 
-Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best 
-Create a website and put the end model into production 
-write a blog post about the project and its results   

Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question. Cheers!
With recruiting season underway this series has been very helpful to me Ken!
Review someone's resume or portfolio who applied for internship that would be great help
Great analysis as always Ken! I have a query, I have been working as a Data scientist for past 4 years in IT services firm and have delivered projects in Engineering domain(customers in manufacturing , aero, auto etc) . Even though I have some good projects(the ones I delivered for the customers)  to showcase on CV, I don't have a proper GitHub profile because I cant recreate the projects I did in GitHub  because of customer /project confidentiality.  In this case what would be your advice on building a solid GitHub profile, which datasets / project I can work on?
Great video! :)
Cool, lately one great portfolio follows the next one, haha :D
Great to see all of these clean portfolios!
hello man, 
could you address the gap issue if someone has couple of years gap since he/she graduated.
is this gonna be a problem in industry to get a job after 3...4 years even he/she gets  certificates from 365 data science or somewhere else.
this person's core computer science concepts are still fresh.

please give me a broad view of this issue or post a video if that's possible.
thank you :)
Hey Ken, so I have a project where I train a neural network to determine if a piece of text is toxic or not. However, during the exploration portion of the data, racial and homophobic slurs are shown (graphs and word cloud) to emphasize that they are the most common toxic words. How would I go about saying that I do not condone these words?
Great video, that option for light and dark theme was really unique.
Loving this series! Awesome job Pranay üòÑ
Hey ken can you do another series of building a data science project form scratch?? That series was a great learning experience for me.. thanks for what you‚Äôre doing for us.
The only project I've completed so far is the titanic set. should I even bother putting this into a portfolio seeing as how everyone has seen it before and it has solutions posted?
I'm completing my Masters degree in data science in a few days and this video gave me an idea of how I need to set up my CV. Thanks, keep up the good work.
Definitely agree with you Ken, the portfolio website is nice and clean, project readme on GitHub are well structured, data visualizations are impressive, great job Pranay!
Hey Ken, Thank you very much for taking your time :D The feedback was really helpful
Best? Are we now choosing favorite children, now?? Just teasing, great work, Ken! (and very clean portfolio, Pranay!)
Almost 100k Ken! Keep up the great videos
Hey Ken I have two questions regarding CV. Should the projects and work experience be above educational qualifications? Would you recommend a 2-3 pages CV which is much clearer and larger in fonts or a single page CV like that of this guy?
Another awesome video in this series. Really liked your suggestion on how to present the most important key point of a project at the top, so anybody can get what its solving in the first 30 seconds to 1 mint. Thanks again Ken for making this video.

Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges.
My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...
Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.
I imagine Andrew is one of those people who is just really pleasant to talk to. There is just something about the way he communicates that is just so captivating. Loved the interview! :)
brah when the video was minimized and you know it start moving i though you are flithy frank
Awesome interview!! Finally learned about your background Andrew! I had no idea you were pre-med. Also super entertaining üòÑ Ken - your interview series keeps getting better and better üòç Keep up the amazing work!
Thanks for the great videos as always Ken Jee! I love your content! Andrew is such a great guy as well. Please make more project-related videos. I would love that :)
Wow! Thank you so much for this! Gave him a follow! :-)

Also, I noticed that you have a BS in Economics. I am currently an Economics major too and am interested in your hearing about your journey from Econ to Data Science. I wonder if you'd be willing to make some videos about that because I would appreciate your insight and advice.
Truly a success story! Thank you so much for doing this #KenJee and congrats to Andrew from #dataleap  :D keep up the good work!
Hey Ken Jee, hope you are doing great.
I jave a question, in your opinion how long it takes to become a good data scientist or data analyst for someone who is good in statistics and using excel, beginner in programming, knows  the basics of sql, python and tableau
I want to ask you a question and ƒ± hope you will answer. I am willing to be a data scientist. After 3 years, ƒ± can have a job because i am in a college right now and student of statistics and computer science program. And my question is; will data science job die until i get the job or data science will die in the future?
Premiering now! Take a pee break https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1_n6Fh3eXA
thanks for doing this Ken!
Does he have a LinkedIn?
Crazy excited! Much love to Ken for the whole shebang. What memories...

Awesome Video Ken!
Sorry for my second comment and request in the same video, but it would be very nice if you could do a video on the possibilities of transitioning to Data Science coming from a social sciences background beyond economics (sociology, anthropology, history and/or any field that requires analytical thinking and may involve qualitative research). I'm thinking either of a research context (ex masters or PhD students) or simply BS/BA graduates. Thank you again.
Congratulations for expanding your channel's scope beyond the US, Ken Jee. You are doing an amazing job. I'd like to thank you in the name of non-US to-be data scientists and ask you, if possible and convenient, to do a video on making it to the Data Science field in the Brazilian context, if it is the case that you already know any successful Brazilian data scientist. Best wishes.
Great interview! As someone from Europe I am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the US,
since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online.
One small note; at some points in the video, especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low,
the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still an awesome discussion tho! :)
Really good interview Ken !
Just one suggestion as audience: Do not add background music, it is annoying
Thanks Ken Jee for bringing Vijay to your channel. Vijay was absolutely inspiring. It's very motivating for students like me who aspire to work in the field of Data Science. Thank you üíô
That's so cool...! 
I wanna ask you one question K'Jee, from india how many views you will get in your total views ?
Bhai
Amazing Ken. Thank you for bringing to us such Data Experts who share their story. 
Just want to let you know, these are highly inspirational and moving.
Thank you. Really.
Just found your channel a few days ago and absolutely love your content! I watched your Data Science Project from sctach series and found it very beneficial. I was wondering if you could make a video targeted at beginners as to what kind of EDA we should be doing depending on our data, maybe explain some of the statistics knowledge needed when picking features to use in models etc (not necessarily how to create plots as you did this in your EDA episode of the ds project series). Thanks for putting out content this useful for free, keep it up man
Thanks for sharing this interview ken. I have done my masters in electronics and communication. I definitely feel motivated after watching this interview.
Great to have an influential speaker here! Incredible diversity in your interviews, thanks for the great content as always Ken :)
Thank you, Ken. 
I also from Electrical Background and the information is most insightful to me.
just want to say thank you ken...üß°
Consistency and believing the process is the most important take away from here :)
Thank you so much, Ken. It's inspiring and encouraging.
How about a video of making the transition from graduate school in the life sciences to data science. I know you can get data science certificates. What steps should people with PhDs not in CS (eg biology/genomics) take while they‚Äôre in grad school?

Really very neatly done project. I am checking his project and reading all the descriptions. Its very explanatory . Thanks Ken Jee for making video on this one. Also thanks for Q/A session at the end.
Hi Ken. Just found your channel recently and it‚Äôs been an amazing resource for me. I‚Äôm new to data science and as a former athlete, I‚Äôm hoping to work in sports analytics eventually. However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what you‚Äôve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun? A little confused on how I should present myself.
A question here, Ken:
As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project.
Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects.
Hey Ken, What kind of projects people with 5 years of exp should have if they are willing to move into Data Science? What extra things do we add to get calls for the interview?
Loving this project/resume series - it's just full of useful tips. I'm just about to start an MSc Data Science and I'm planning to do some project work to complement the course content. I saw that you did your undergraduate in Economics, do you have any tips for an economics undergraduate transitioning to DS?
Amazing! Anyway, this is my first Kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/miguelrosales/data-analysis-of-house-prices ,  I hope you can check it, Ken! Thank you as always! :)
It's great as always, Ken.
He has got an amazing project. Thanks for sharing.
Oh man Ken!  I'm just starting my GA capstone project, and I was always wondering when you would review a capstone project.  This is awesome!  Maybe I'll shoot you a message when my capstone is done after October 12.  Thanks always for what you do!
very cool project. The detail in the ReadMe is impressive. As a relative newbie,  this is quite intimidating to me.  Wondering how long it will take me to get to this level of proficiency.
Thanks a ton Ken. The project you selected was really awesome on showing one of the best in class documentation. Learned quite a few points from it. Someday I shall submit my own project for your review. üôÇ
Already the 20th episode, wow! It feels like you just started this series yesterday and now 20 episodes in you covered so many different resumes and projects! I believe in general, talking more about the other side is very valuable in conversation. We as humans just like talking about our own views and when a company is hiring, they of course want to know what they can "get" from a candidate.
Focusing on value we can create rather than the value we can receive! Excellent lessons for any stage of DS, thanks for staying up so late editing this :)
Hi I am a junior DS.. big thanks to you for inspiring videos that help me to keep going.. Good work
Awesome video Ken! Cool, I'm early today. Great advice on stressing the value that one can bring to an organization. I really like the organization and layout of the "Hotel Review NLP" project, great job Ahilan! The class balancing is also a great way to make the classifier less bias, great job!
Oh, and nice mechanical keyboard by the way üòä
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope this video helps you on your #66DaysOfDataChallenge!

Ken , meeting more friends are required, but after college I have met many false friends. Because of competition, and others
You have worked hard on handwriting.  Another great video , you touched all the important aspects of being successful. Thanks for video.
Hi Ken, helpful video as always, thank you! One thing I wanted to touch on was the example around 4:00 about weight loss. Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from "fat" aka something negative to "skinny" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people. It's my impression that Data Science as a field is trying to be more inclusive, and I believe weight inclusivity needs to be part of that. Thanks for reading if you did!
Idk why I missed this video... I'm just trying to sort my activities and learning plan for this month and the 66daysofdata challenge but I didn't knew where to start, this was really helpful because my mind was all over the place haha
Thanks for insights. Lastly my motivation to learn data science dropped. Content like that helps me to motivate myself.
Eyyy Chikna :*
Excellent
Thanks for your inspiring tips
Another great video, Ken! Thank you for the inspiration!
Thank you Ken for creating this video. Simple rules and defining what these rules are a great way to start. 
I am also starting my data science journey and found this motivating and helpful.
this speech is explanatory, meaningful, and consistent. good video!
This video made me subscribe. Thanks for the content! Keep it up!
I love this.  I read Atomic Habits earlier this year and it inspired me to add more structure to my life.  If I'm being honest, some of my habits have stuck better than others.  Do you struggle with this and how do you tackle it?  Thanks!
good stuff. One question: what about restoration/renewal? We aren't machines. We need to cycle though and schedule rest also.
I‚Äôm new to your channel and loved this video. Thanks for posting these tips!
üëå
Great advise Ken, thank you for sharing!
Man that‚Äôs goofy. You‚Äôre the first person other than me that I‚Äôve seen that likes that specific Korean Barbeque jerky. 4:02 when you‚Äôre making the smoothie
You look like shaved Gilfoyle tbh
Guys also checkout deepwork by cal newpot
You will be fascinated reading that
I think I'm going to watch this when I wake up every day for a couple weeks
Why don't you use ig ken???? I wish I could follow youüò£ü•∫
Love you bro. Thanks a lot for these videos!
Love the content
Ken thanks a lot and wanted to ask you what can I do next after completing python
4 disciplines and atomic habits are amazing books!
Hey ken,
I resonated very closely with you on the last point of 'focusing on one imp thing' as for a couple of months i was learning data analytics (sql/tableau/excel etc) and ml and dl(Nlp/Cv) all at same time and was going nowhere even after putting atleast 10hrs everyday. This last point made me realize how important it is to focus on one thing at time. Now i'm going to start with data analytics,find a job and build up from there.
Again,thanks Ken
Wow...look at those handwritten checklists / notes...the clocks with different time zones...amazing..
Thanks ken for this video, what worked for me is spirituality (Yes I am an Indian), its just enjoying the present moment, and being in the present, that's it....You can't describe in words what sprirtuality does to you, but its just watching the things happening around you, and not being affected by them ( Karma Yoga as it is written in Bhagwat Geeta)
Hi Ken, nice video. I really liked the last tip, I've been concious that focusing on one thing could bring in way more results than juggling too may at once. However, I have this irrational fear that I'll lose out on time I could be using to do all of those other things, which is why everything is always top of the priority list.
The timing couldn't have been any better on this video. Really truly thank you.
YouTube=strangers! Haha. Great video never would I expect jump roping in a data science video!
There are so many gems in this video! Please make more videos like these ‚ù§Ô∏è
This video was very inspirational in terms of how I can measure my personal success. The pillar of celebrating your successes really spoke to me because I'm in the midst of interviews for internships and after passing some of the initial rounds, I shared my hard work with my supportive friends and this motivated me to study even harder for the final rounds of those interviews. Thanks for the motivational content as always :'))
awesome stuff here Ken
Hi Ken.  Thanks for the videos.  I have been watching for a while and just went back to school this fall.   Motivation has been a struggle and this video is right on point for me.   Your pillars help me realign and rethink my approach to school, day job and child also going to school from home!
I have been a data guy for years and figured it is time to ‚Äúformalize‚Äù by background and experience with a degree.  Appreciate your sharing and keep up to solid work!
great content as always ! Thanks man.
Great content
"Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn" is great advise...another great video !

I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.

 I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called "How To Learn Data Science Smartly?" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try  to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering.
It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically!
Thank you a lot for sharing this;
about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done.
I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.

When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this "way of thinking" from, but it was very inspiring to me.
Even if you (as in "you" personally) do not feel that you have achieved "that" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done "average" or "somewhat well", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. 
I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)
one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning. this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them.
Can you Make a Video About writing an article(like medium)? How to Start and How to Write Useful Content with good edit and format.
I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:

1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. 
The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have "7 habits of highly successful people". 

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)

Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many "YES!!" I've shouted when marking one ;)

PS:
#66daysofdata
If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :)
PS2:
Haven't told you that before, but it seems we have something in common! -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnqZl_blT7E :P
i think ken is transitioning into a film maker  more so than a data scientist :)
Why those three clocks have three different time showing?
Thanks for the video. My energy has been really zapped the last month from depression and sometimes I just need a little re-frame of my mindset. Last night was the first time I opened up some coding learning material. Thanks, Mr. Jee.
... My main takeaways were you also enjoy Golden Island Jerky and we're the same age. ;)

Just kidding. Great video and consistent with a lot of things that I've read on self improvement. :D
Great video ! Thank you Ken , super helpful I'll be checking these books out !
Intrigued by the thumbnail, but stayed for the thoughtful tips. Accountability explained simply, letting others down is a lot scarier than letting yourself down! Also the editing game is getting upped :)
3:14 the fence on the left looks slightly surprised
This is an awesome motivational video Ken! Thanks for sharing your 5 pillars of success. For me, learning to say ‚Äòno‚Äô can work wonders, to give back time that I could use to be productive and take me a step closer toward reaching life‚Äôs goals. As Jim Rohn puts it, ‚ÄúTime is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.‚Äù
It's inspiring and motivating, Ken
Thank you so much.
You Are an Inspiration. Keep Going . Much Love.
Exactly the thing that I needed 
Thanks Ken 
I started #66days project with you but I couldn't do it regularly this helps a lot üëç
thanks for motivating me to study data science along with my college
Pecs of peace
Please make more videos like this.
I did all of these to move forward...domino's over too many plates..not to say that each domino has up to 4 facets....but dominos!
Really this motivates me to keep going , Thank you ken  :)
Noice video as always
Very good content i see you from Argentina
Beautiful and motivating.
Hey could you please get back to me on discord?
Again, special thanks to Alex for speaking with me. His experience in IndyCar is so unique, and I think everyone can learn quite a bit from his Journey.

Ken, you never fail to amaze with such useful stuff. This was awesome!
Dude.. your interviews are awesome... 
You should think about starting a podcast. It would be cool to listen to just audio.. on Spotify or such..
Bhai
Subscribed to @innoarchitech, his stuff is awesome! Thanks Ken for interviewing and bringing his work to light
Awesome interview; it was very interesting to listen to someone with such an interesting background! 
You can basically start a podcast with so many interviews haha :D
Thanks Ken and Alex for such a great interview.
I had a question regarding the scope of Data Science in the Automotive Industry.Can you help?
Here's the link to the AI Readiness article and model that I talk about in this video: https://www.innoarchitech.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-machine-learning-readiness
Got a chance to watch the premier live and I really enjoyed the interview. Thanks Alex and Ken! üçµ
Thanks for such an enlightened interview Ken Jee! Love from Bangladesh
I can't wait for this to premiere! Ken's a great interviewer and his YouTube channel is awesome!
Yoooo, it is my dream to work IndyCar or f1. Can't wait!!
I forgot to mention it in the video, but Deepak should definitely add his hackathon experience to his resume! Special thanks to Deepak for letting me review his work. If you would like me to review your resume, comment below and email your work to kenjee.ds@gmail.com!

Hello there! How did Deepak create a portfolio like this? It's awesome! I already have a github and LinkedIn detailed but not a portfolio, it's gorgeous and very attractive. I really want to explore more in depth this option :) especially because I'm searching for a job right now. Nice video BTW, I just discovered you, you really seems a nice guy.
Hey Ken,
Can you make a video on a project, where you predict the number of views you'll get in a week/month for that video?
Also thank you for such amazing content. Much needed üòÉ
Hey Ken, I've not yet watched the full video (although I'm sure it will be super helpful), but I wanna tell you that you could consider reviewing portfolios of your latest emails, because otherwise the person who sent you the portfolio won't get that much value (since in 6 months time he will have probably gotten a job). It's just a suggestion (I haven't sent you mine so I don't have personal interests).
Hey Ken, great video as usual! 

I just thought I would mention, if you add a ' smile' in the Amazon affiliates link, it will take people to Amazon smile instead, where Amazon pay an additional 0.5% to a chosen charity for no extra cost :)
Hi, Ken! I just want to say, you are such a good person! Thank you for helping us aspiring data scientist! :)
That's a very helpful video! Thank you!
What do you think of using pre-trained models and creating useful applications out of it? Would that still count as a portfolio project?
Great stuff as always ü§üü§ü
Do you think there is merit in making resumes and cover letters using Latex?
Interesting resume and great tips. Thank you!
I think C++ skills are a very nice to have although he probably will never use them in his work :-D
Good luck finding a job Deepak and thanks for sharing your CV!
This series never gets old! Always helpful to see you review project portfolios! :)
For a data analyst how important are hackathons when job hunting?
One day i will send you my profiles to review.
Really liked your work. :p
Hey Ken!
How important certifications are? Especially when you don't have much work experience. Is it worth to get some to prove that you have the skill or it's not that necessary ?
It was a lot of help #Ken 
But I do have a question regarding resume "Is it really IMPORTANT not to set Pic on our RESUME or we have to give pic in our RESUME"
Thanks Ken for reviewing my resume and projects. I really appreciate you for doing this. I will make the necessary updates.
‚úå.
Thanks for watching everyone! Keep up the great work with the #66DaysOfData Challenge! More info on that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXLnbdHMf8w&ab_channel=KenJee
0:00 Intro
1:30 Why is it important to learn from other's code?
4:04 My approach
5:18 Example
Very valuable tips!!! Thank you so much for taking time to share!
wow, thanks for sharing.
Great process! I should look into this Notion app.
Thank you. As a beginner , it is okay to just copy other people's notebooks . I didn't know that, and it used to make me miserable . I can make small projects of my own now(really small) , but it still helps to know that back then,  I didn't know, what I didn't know.
I was doing it all wrong till now. When in earlier video you said go through the notebooks, I was literally reading the code not understanding. Thanks for clearly explaining what we are looking for when we look at the code and how to use the documentations the better way. Thank you so much .
Interestingly, i left beginners project many times just because I could not approach and do them myself. And seeing other's notebook looks like cheating to me. Thank you for removing my notion.
Thanks for explaining the process. Reviewing is the best way which we can apply for learning and I also use discussion like if you have someone with you while studying it leads to good results. I am interacting with you through video but it is really great because it motivates me to come back again and go ahead.
I've always had this question on how to approach a solved notebook? Should I code open the notebooks side by side and type in one by one or should I go over the solved one and then try to understand. I always wondered how others might be doing or which is the best approach (if any)! So, how would have approached if that was a video lecture where the solution walkthrough is done? Any suggestions, Ken? And, thanks a ton for creating such nuggets of videos, really helpful for beginners like me. Even the comments sections in your videos are insightful.
one of the best data science channels out there.. kia kaha tonu..keep going
Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a "sanitized" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing "notebooks" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?


Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? 


The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.

Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.
Hi Ken
Great content as usual
May I have some recommendations or suggestions from you?
I'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics. The situation is that I know about one field, working with data and models in this particular area but I wanna make myself a bit more employable post graduation. Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network). 
Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge? 
I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job. 
Thank you
So I did a project on linear regression and I'm still kind of struggling to understand it. I looked up Kaggle Notebooks titled "Linear Regression" or something close to that. Other than watch other courses, read other books, and do more projects is there anything else I can do?
Let's help ken reach üíØ k  üî•
This is actually so much like machine learning algorithms themselves. Like we go through loads of notebooks to understand the innate algorithms and patterns of being s good data scientist and then after we're done training ourselves with others notebooks, we can test our understanding by predicting on newer projects and then matching with others who have done the similar projects. üôÑ
always the best tips, thx man
Thank you so much, Ken! You are truly amazing!!!
zero dislikes wow!!!
Until now I used to take on Github notebooks but I think Kaggle is a great option too. Plus there are a lot of introductory notebooks on kaggle if you need to dive in a new concept.
i feel im gonna quit this field the barrier to entry is too high and i cant build my project out of novel ideas
So, I have couple of questions related to transformation techniques (log, boxcox etc). 
- Do I need to use same transformation technique on all the features even though that technique may not be good for other feature?
- Do I need to use transformation on dependent variable too? 
Thanks in advance! again I would like to add that you are doing amazing work!
May God bless you for sharing this pertinent information. Thank you professor.
Which tool is he using for the notes again!?
Thank you Ken. I'll adopt this approach the more.
Genius
Can I have your contact details?? I have some doubts regarding masters in datascience
Great work ...It helps to learn Data science in efficient way ,thanks for this work,
by the way  can you say the documentation software  which you are using  it really looks cool
can I know which is the note taking app which you are using?
Thanks Ken. Got a clear idea of how to go about learning data science. Following along with you on the #66daysofdata challenge.
Hi Ken, great work, I am also taking part in the amazing #66DaysOfData, great initiative, it's motivating me so much you have no idea! I can't thank you enough for this. What's the name of the app you're using in the video to take notes? Thanks again
This video was great!

I have found some frustration from "not understanding a topic" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!

Thanks for the video Ken!
This is dope bro! Seeing you through the process is priceless. Good job. ty
Happy Teacher's Day!!!
This is a great approach for people who don't have a lot of free time on their hands. Another amazing video Ken!
Yeah, I totally agree with this approach. Whenever I start to work on something, I try to learn the steps form another person's GitHub. If I end with new function or new term I basically Google it out or search in stack. And I found that if I do the same patterns of problems or project for 4/5 times then I will have picked the patterns  already.
It's amazing, Ken.
Thanks for sharing üòä
You are a life saver !!
Ken, Thanks for the great insight. Very useful video for beginners.
Happy Teacher's Day ken, Thanks for sharing...üß°
This was super helpful ! :)
Just curious, but why do you have 3 clocks in your roomüòÖ
Thanks for valuable tips Ken. I am going to apply them on my #66DaysOfData  journey and projects from now on
Today is teacher's day in India, so Happy teacher's day Ken. So far your guidance through these videos is really helping me learn Data science. Thank you.
As a 20% data scientist üòÖ I totally agree with this approach. I also remember you saying anyone who is learning a new thing should seek 30% theoretical knowledge and 70% practice, I also agree with that. 

Keep up! You are crushing it! üí™
Amazing video Ken! This is so insightful and helpful for my data science journey
Always loves your video. You are inspiration I work so hard learning this field. Could you please help me in some of the topics I asked you on #66DaysOfData? I am stucked and I really need some help.
Thanks amen! I appreciate you helping others learn faster and more efficiently. I haven‚Äôt seen all the resources but it‚Äôll be great you posting more resources to find codes other have built! Looking forward to more!
Thanks ken for being you :)
Bro, I am a developer who is thinking to learn but while thinking got stuck much places. Without knowing basis how need to move like that I thought. Basics is completely theoretical. Your way is awesome to learn tq so much‚ù§. I can use this in different field also. I am doing the 66 day challenge  even got confusing. You cleared my way which need to proceed. Do well like these videos much. Thank you so much.
Thank u sir for this video You clear all my doubts.üôÇüôÇüôÇ
Exactly what I was looking for 
Thank you man
On one hand I really love your channel and I don¬¥t want it to become mainstream but on the other hand I really hope you will be rewarded for the effort & quality that comes with these videos. - So here you get a comment for the algorithm :D
Starting my Data Science Bachelor soon & your videos are like steroids for my motiviation :) Keep it up man!
Thanks KEN keep up the good work!
üëè Practical üëè Tips üëè FOR THE WIN
I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:

1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models.
2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.

There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.

I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks.
Great video Ken! Your daily progress updates on discord motivates me even more. Thank you for doing thisüòä
I really love this initiative! It really motivates me everyday to know that thousands of others are also learning the field!
I think reviewing notebooks is a great idea and I'll definitely do that as well in future days-of-data, for now I'll focus on the theory first.
Let's build some habits!
Thank you, you answered the exact question I had, how to best go about this.
Excellent tips üëç
This will be what I do
Wow. Best video I‚Äôve seen for learning date science / analysis
This is a highly valuable and useful video!
Thanks a ton Ken!üôå
Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. 
On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts üòÉ), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips! (Wow, I've just noticed how long this comment has become)
ofcos he didnt look good
I love hands-on learning
I thought that I hate this field but you help me to realize how much I still love this field and I quit my meaningless and bad job to be better and learn more because that job didn't make me a better data scientist. You even inspire me to write articles. thank you so much.
thanks man! This is helping me unblock things in my head, and allows me to keep my own personal #66daysofdata alive :) Plus, I already wanted to check the very notebook you're showing there (since I am doing a lot of this uncooperative House regression thingy). It also an important lesson since, so far, I wanted to take pride into trying to build my own model alone from scratch without external help ... well, I guess I came as far as I could with this method which your video is helping me understand :)
I think this is actually an incredible idea
You are such an inspiration to us!!

Thanks for motivating us :)
Bro. This is top. Maybe you have already said it and I'm mistaken, but I haven't been able to find it in your videos. What kind of projects would you recommend for getting a data ANALYST job (I've seen the data scientist recommendations, but I suppose they are not the same). I would really appreciate it, although I know you are busy. Thank you for everything ;-)

love the part where both of you discussed about growth mindset on dealing with mathematics. it's absolutely the key to not limit our potential, because we can do more than we imagine.
Getting a BA in philosophy hoping to get my masters in computer science.
What was your eco class?
I follow both of your content and I love it! I have a biology undergrad and I have one more year for my masters in music performance. I wanted to transition into data science/ SWE, would you recommend the MCIT program? Are there programs like that which made for non cs majors? Extremely inspiring contentüëçüëçüëçüëç
Thank you for this interview. I just started my foray into data science with 0 background experience. I've out of school many years and that's a little intimidating, so it was great to see a female coder who was able to acquire the relevant skills from scratch. I'm inspired.
The best data science interview I've seen
Awesome Video Bro !!!
Are there any people here who managed to get into DS with an undergraduate degree in CS ? I am still first year but I wonder whether it is possible to get a DS job as a fresh CS undergrad.
"So, I got the job first & then learned everything at the job"

Some people are just lucky, I guess.
Since I am going some very though times right now, having such a video is quite inspiring. I wanted to save them for later but, after what I learned in one of your previous video ... the best thing to do is to learn to emulate the best! Not just the technical aspects, but the habits and frame of mind required as well .... it is a pretty long interview, but I'll digest it in several chunk today :)
#66Daysofdata
dude please try to improve audio quality.
Thanks for sharing this interview with us Ken. Keep it up! :)
This was super insightful to me as a FAANG contractor haha. You guys reminded me to have my resume tell my journey.
Interesting journey :)
It's really a great interview, Ken. Thanks for sharing with us!!
Amazing interview! Tina really is a motivating force as well, it's just amazing to see how people, even from non-cs backgrounds, make a transition into software engineering, or in this case, even data science. Thank you for the helpful content!
Ken could PM since I am getting an MSBA and I seeking supplemental material such as the 365 course in your over video. Let me know if this possible, thanks.
Finaly a female data scientist. Yes girls learn to code
Hey Ken. Thanks for creating Such Awesome Contents. I am really inspired by You and I am too thinking  to create my Channel. 

I wanted to Ask That How to get project Ideas for programming in Python or any other Lang Data Science and Python in Specific.
Please Try Creating a Video on it if U think This Is Something Worth to Share with Others Too.
Challenge accepted
2:05 My OCD really wants to synchronize the minute hands on those clocks. LOL, great insights as always, Ken.
my two favorite data science youtubers in one video!! It's abundantly clear who I'll have to thank when I land a job someday..
I have also just finished masters in CS. 
Only this lockdown i decided to learn DS. 

So relatable. 
Thanks @ken and @Tina

Learnee alot.
So what were her projects that had value to others?
I would rather listen to this without background music. It's so relaxing that it makes me sleep :)
It's one of your best videos. I really learned and enjoyed alot. Thank you so much for interviewing such people
Awesome interview Ken and Tina! Great story on breaking into data science from a pharmacology/bioinformatics background üòÉüëçüëç
Great interview! Thanks Ken, I loved learning about FAANG interviews
if that isnt wifey material idk what is
Hey !! I am super exited about your #66daysofdatascience I have checked multiple times but i haven't found any video regarding day 1 of 66 have you not posted it or it is on some other platform please let me know!!! i am a beginner and i think that series will be of great help
Thanks so much for having me! It was so much fun doing this! Also just so much fun chatting with you every time üòä
Really interesting  interview
Thanks for the interview. Also Tina is awesome! :D
This is my favorite video so far. Great guest. She said a lot of things that opened my mind. She definitely is a "work smart, not hard" type
I'd wife her
Tina rocks! Incredible insights from this interview
Again, special thanks to Darwin for submitting his gitub profile! If you would like to have your projects, resumes, portfolios, or linkedin reviewed for a video, please comment below and send me an email at kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
Discord for #66DaysOfData https://discord.gg/VXSUJYJ
Hi ken, after creating a project, how do we put that on our resume? Do we just add the link or put a section for projects and just summarize the project on the resume?
Dude, next time you do this, please just stop going up and down the page. It gave me nausea :(
Agree this is such a cool profile
I know this is a late reply to this video post. My aim for 2021 is also to build a strong GitHub profile and this video is a starter. Loved Darwin's GitHub profile. Ken, can you please post his GitHub profile link as well, I couldn't find him.
I like the Tren Black mention he is one of my favorite tech YouTubers. Probably because he reminds me of myself so much.
Your clocks are painfully out of sync in the minute hand
I know I‚Äôm 3 months late but I think it would be cool to answer comments but only good questions üòÅ choose wisely
Hey Ken, 
I have been working as a Mainframe developer with 3+ years experience. I have been quite well with Python as well. Right now, I have enrolled myself in a DataScience MS course and trying to build my github and kaggle profile. I have made an account in Medium and started blogging as well. But I have never made a website(except using blogger and wordpress). Just wanted to know about your thoughts on having a personal website.
Thanks :)
I agree, this is a very neat and tidy repo, very compact and well documented. Only critism I have is that when I comes to using github in the real world the developer/data scientist will need a good understanding of working with development, staging and production branches which is not demonstrated here. In addition, when it comes to deploying models through cloud services such as aws it is more secure to have everything in its own repo
Is it just me but i am seeing a lot of Indians Here.üòÅüòÑ
Hi ken jee thanks for the video
Just a quick question how much tensorflow and tableau needed for a data science job?
If you ever want to review my second attempt at a regression, it is in a gist here. My first one, which was huge was just embarrassing. This one at least gives better results. But I‚Äôm not overconfident that everything I star is correct. hope so :) https://gist.github.com/lewiuberg/7b2c750ede0c3e9026ea0dca8e6e1c89
Responding to questions from the comments at the end of the video definitely sounds like a good idea to me, thanks for the great videos, really useful content!
Thanks Ken for another great video! I agree with you Ken, Darwin's GitHub is very well structured folder-wise, content-wise and format-wise. The plots are visually appealing. The drop-down button is also an awesome feature, I also haven't used that yet üòÉ
Very interesting.
Hey Ken, I've a question. Since I saw your video where you built a project from scratch and I discovered pd.apply(), I feel that I've been abusing it. I've read more about the function and sometimes another implementations are faster. When do you decided to not use pd.apply() and use other methods?
Thanks for accepting my invitation on LinkedIn. Can you please review my profile as well?
Wow ... Great GitHub profile , motivating to create such one üòÑ
New personal goal : submit a profile to Ken in 6-7 months.(Currently have an empty github).
hey ken quick question. When describing ones skills with ML on the resume, is it better to name specific models, or more general techniques? i.e Skills: Machine Learning (linear regression, svm, PCA, etc...) vs. Skills: Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction etc..). Thanks for all the videos you put out, and thanks for reading!
Responding to good questions at the end is great for everyone who can learn from the questions they didn‚Äôt even think of.
Congratulations to Darwin,very good portfolio! I also browsed it and got very surprised : https://github.com/darwin-a .It's good to know that he got his first job in DS 3 months ago. My portfolio is also a bit different, because I recorded some videos of the last 4 projects.
Thanks bro!
I feel that incorporating good questions into videos would be good. That way people dont ask the same question over and over again. Also good questions wont get lost as videos get older.
Hi ken, do you think a github portfolio is better than a personal website that contains all your information and projects ? Or should I do both. Thank you
Wow, I actually haven't seen this one repo - multiple projects folders approach so far; that's a pretty neat idea!
Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos!
Speaking of questions: Here's one:
So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give "something back", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced? 

Oh and I'm excited for the 66 days of data science! :) 
Personally I'll probably go for 66 days of machine learning engineering haha
Take one question and a 2-5 minute segment on it would be cool at the end of the video. Even throw in an example. Cheers!
I know it's outdoor but three clocks on the wall !!!
It's  a productivity matter or it's just a decor ...
Namasthe Ken Jee. This is Shiva from India. I'm a mechanical Engineering graduate from Lovely professional University with a 6.5 CGPA grade.

I'm currently learning IBM Data science Professional certificate and planning to start Python 3 programming from Univ. Of Michigan ( both on Coursera). 

MY GOAL: By the end of Jan 2021, I should be working as a Data scientist. I want to celebrate my birthday (23/02/2021) as a data scientist! üî•

Would you please guide me through this journey?
Hi Ken what would you suggest for variable engineering, EDA and data visualization? Welding etc.
Hello Ken! I want to thank you for all the great videos you provide that really help us, the ones that are interested in entering the field of data science. I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do?  
Thank you!
Go ahead with responding comments üíØüëç
Love this approach in reviewing, very honest and straightforward
Before this video, I thought creating more and more repos would actually be a great show off in front of employers, but now I think that I really have to work on my GitHub and organize it. Thanks for this video brother.
I think that would be a good idea. I asked a q on your last video so I'm excited to connect!
That's the best way to respond to our questions, please!
Thanks bro! Do you have a goodreads profile?
This series is going greatüòÅ
Thanks Ken!

9.1.2021 saw the hashtag trending on twitter. followed the breadcrumbs to see who started it and why. Great idea. Will apply concept to my current job role as a business analyst. thank you for helping me break up the monotony.
Thank you Ken Jee, I will start tomorrow
Amazing stuff Ken! Btw I am unable to join the discord :/
Thanks for sharing! It's awesome that your committed to continual learning.
Love this starting on this tomorrow.
I am seeing your videos from past few weeks and I even made an account on Kaggle and was trying to see what that Housing Project is all about. But after seeing it, i was overwhelmed and was questioning myself whether I'll be able to learn these things. Then, I started learning python basics and seeing your posts on LinkedIn where a lot of people talked about this initiative and now here I am seeing this videos and thinking of going this way. Maybe I'll be able able to understand what to do in that project after few weeks. #day1 #66daysofdata
Watching a data science video on YouTube was a good punch... Also if you don't mind can you share which background music you have used in the background because for me it is also helping me to stay connected...
Good morning.  I want to join the 66 days challenge in 2021. Please how do I follow up with the program
Hey! You mentioned that you will be using the 365 data science course, is it the same as the udemy (365 data science bootcamp 2020) or is it different?
This is great! I'm going to start this in the new year!
Hi @KenJee,

How to choose Data Science domain?

Things that should be kept in mind before choosing a domain.

Any suggestion will be a great help.
For statistics I would recommend the books of Geoff Cumming instead (abandon p-values and embrace confidence intervals!). üòâ If you're new, start with "Introduction to the New Statistics", otherwise have a look at "Understanding the New Statistics". His website is great with cool stuff www.thenewstatistics.com and he has also made some nice videos www.youtube.com/user/geoffdcumming/videos (check the Dance of p-values or Significance roulette)
I definitely was not expecting that wink. Loved it! lol Thanks for making these kinds of videos :D
Hey Ken, have you ever tried Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla? I'm learning so far from that.
Oh men! I don't know why I just saw this. Nonetheless, I've been going through the Kaggle Microcourses for a few days now. Thanks for the recommendation! :)  #Day45 #Late
Where do you learn stat for DS most effieciently? Thinkstat? 365 datascience?
i agree, the "Right One"would not exist and it solely depends on people's available resources and their interest as well depend on their determination to continue put the effort to learn it!
hey ken which pc are you using now?
Nice, I started to learn machine learning a week ago, soon will join u after finishing basic courses!
Hey man,

Really glad to find individuals such yourself. I will be joining a bit late but starting today. For sure each person should apply himself the best method suited to their own motivation and capabilities. Myself I started with Data Camp, its user interface and the app helps me a lot to engage on it and will be using the hashtag you displayed. 

Keep it up please, you are honest and very approachable in your videos, your first person perspective is one of the sparks  I needed. Thank you very much man. You really rock.

Regards from Barcelona.
System requirements for Data science ?
Hi Ken. I was recently made redundant and decided to take advantage of the chance to return to the type of work that makes me happy (problem solving). I decided to learn Python and became very interested in data analysis and data science. A few weeks in I found your channel and that is when I really found direction. Thanks. I did have one quick question that I cannot find covered elsewhere in your videos. I like all your advice on CV and LinkedIn information but what would you put as your current  job title in my situation (paid for several months but not actually working for an employer). Thanks again for your amazing guidance.
Hello Ken. How can I get to reach you? Kindly
Dude I just discovered you but I love your videos. They have been really helpful. I majored in ecnomics and graduated this june and am now doing my masters in quantitative economics and I'm trying to figure out what I need to learn on the side. Thanks for making these!!
Hello Kan, 
I started it late but was highly recommended by a friend to do it. But I am missing the track like which videos belong to which day. Could you suggest how should I filter that (which video belong to day1 , day 2 etc.)? Eagerly looking for your help
How can a novice start journey about statistics and probability for data science. If possible could you please provide any resources, books so that we can learn enough to land myself into Data Science field.
Hey everyone, how's your progress? I'm sharing a template I created, you can make a copy and use it to track your daily Data Science activities: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V9FKGREWCjv6sJ2pADT29iMoxTw_BfKOraGKCpYB_MY/edit#gid=1603444521
Actually am working in some other domain but want to transist my carier as a data scientist ..given time constraint if i study for 1-2 hrs (only) daily .. Can i become a data scientist  in 66 days .. Provided i learned coding,statistics bit of lib so far .. Plz reply.
1. I'm excited to join #66DaysOfData!
2. No joke, I have the same shirt I got in 2017! It's a sign! I will wear it on my journey! Thank you!!!
o.k.  I started today by watching this video.  I guess now I need to get a twitter account.  Thanks for the kick in the butt.
Ken please make a playlist for this series 
Will be helpful for everyone
Ken, thank you very much for this video. It's quite informative and you share a trove of resources. I'm collecting resources for accompanying you in this journey as I am also very interested in developing my competencies and skills in data science. 
Tx again.
Fantabulous challenge! I'm in! Hats off to your initiative!!!
Hi Ken
I just found your channel yesterday and I'm about to start learning data science. This is so amazing thank you so much for making this. Happy to follow along :)
Yessss....you're the best Kenn. This is really awesome. 1st time I feel that I can actually break the iceberg to become a data scientist
Great Idea! I started Sept 1st! I recommend keeping track of progress and time in a spreadsheet, share with friends to stay accountable and on track!
Can a beginner join? I am interested in data science (in plant breeding)
Thank you Ken! I‚Äôve been digging through your channel lately and it‚Äôs great. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering but I really want to go into the data science space. Would you suggest getting a masters?
When you say you will start Kaggle projects, which projects in particular will you be attempting?
Is data science mainly used to do evil such as face recognition and surveillance in communist China? I've just completed first and second stage working on C++,  and I'm presently doing research for next stage of study.
All set ready
Holding a bachelor degree in petroleum engineering but in the past few months i grew passion in DS. Equipped with intermediate python skill (self taught) , might get a DS job someday. Kindly advise whether i should get a degree in computing ? is it necessary to get a degree to land a job in these field ?
Sure, why not.  Ill join ya
did the #66dayofdara app work for you ???
Hey! I've watched your previous videos, and really did learn a lot! Keep up the good work, waiting for your next video!
What if I don't have a twitter account, how can i follow you along?
I am taking ds bootcamp from 365datascience
Hey, Question! I'm going to be graduating with a Bachelors Degree in CS this Spring, but I would love to pivot into Data Science, particularly in the sports field. Do I need a masters, or something else? thanks.
Hey man, where do you get your shirts?
Thank you
This is a great initiative Ken! Gonna be a part of this and hoping that my slacking journey to mastering data science will become more efficient
I'm happy to participate in your #66DaysOfData initiative, Lets Reboot and Finish what we have started... Thanks a Zillion Ken Jee!!!
Thank you for your Video! I'm following you and also willing to participate in your #66DaysOfData initiative :DDDD I was really excited to hear, that you wanted to start all over again, because my Data Science Journey will begin now. Thank you very much for your inspiring videos! And good luck on your new data science journey!
I'll try this. Seems fun
Please tell what are u reading iLL also start from there.......
Hi Ken! Loving this idea. I actually just started the data analyst in python pathway on dataquest a couple days ago after realizing I needed to up my skills if I really wanted to become involved with data analytics/science in the future, so perfect timing. This is an amazing initiative, and although I don't have twitter, I will be following along on your other socials (linkedin/YT) trying to connect with fellow data lovers!
Looking to follow your journey. I‚Äôve just started a post grad course on Data Science and been watching your vids for a lot of help and resources. Thanks man! Good timing that you‚Äôre doing this!
Love you channel! I‚Äôm in grad school, MS Data Science coming from a GIS background, and your channel was my inspiration. My goal is to break into sports analytics and I would love to combine spatial data analysis with sports analytics.
I'm in! So excited for this! Thank you so much, Ken! I'm new to Data Science and I appreciate this very much!
Hi. I have learned some basics of scikit learn and machine learning, is there any specific source you would recommend for learning more of data handling and preprocessing? Thanks : )
Hi Ken,

Thank you for this video. I am new to your channel. For past month or so, I have been going through your videos to learn more about data science and how to break in to this field. I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, and have worked as Business Intelligence Developer for past few years. I am hoping to make it to data science field :).  I have been taking some free courses that you have suggested over the past month (brushed up on my stats, finished two of the Kaggle courses (more in progress),  etc.). I really want to thank you for taking the time to provide guidance to those of us who are new to data science field. I also want to thank you for pushing people like me to break out of their shell and go public :).
Towards a being better data scientist
great idea. I‚Äôm super interested.
Thanks Ken Jee...I'm excited !!
Very cool idea, Ken.  Good luck and thanks as always for continuing to inspire and help grow the DS community!
Wow!! This is so good. I'm going to join you. Excited for this. #66DaysOfData
What keyboard is that? üëÄ
Ya 66 videos on the wayü§üü§ü
Edit: maybe just ignoring the sci-kit info for now? I think I'm in a position where I actually need to learn a lot and I am curious about R specific resources 

I just started a new job (entry level) at a startup and I only know R. I'm currently building out pipelines and other processes and I wanted to know if you had any resources that would be helpful for the 66 days
Lets go...
How to follow if not on Twitter?
Following you commander !
Is it on youtube only?
If so I'll love itüòò
Great initiative! I'll be following along! Just started with Kaggle micro courses.
I'll join the challenge! Accountability is helpful when learning online. Tomorrow's tasks include setting goals, creating a calendar/roadmap, and signing up for twitter. I'm interested to see the journey from different perspectives.
I too feel "stuck" which is why I also will be participating in #66daysofdata.

Time to buckle down and get focused for September!
#66Daysofdata I am in 
Let's play data :)
Thank you.
You are a gem! Love from India
I've been planning to kickstart my DS Journey. And here I have finalized the date. Will be joining you on the journey, come Sept. 1
This is awesome!! Thanks for sharing.
Wow l am on board for this.
I really don't like the number 66. However, I'm a huge fan of the channel and will follow along.
Thanks for this, Hope I can make myself accountable too. See you soon.
Hey, Ken. A question. Is learning Google Data Studios would be useful to a Data Science person?
Can't wait to join the trend #66daysofdata üòÅ
Man why do you have 3 clocks of the same design all telling the different time?
Lets start and do this!!!! #66DaysofData
That's great will join you on the journey, was planning to start from Sept , will keep updating on Twitter following you on daily updates, thanks a lot for this man. Let us taking the competition on Kaggle
Hi Ken! I have seen that the Practical Statistics for Data Scientists book is based on R. Isn't it confusing if you want to focus on Python, or you just want to get the statistics part? Thanks.
I'll definitely be getting involved in this. Thanks Ken !
Count me in Kanjee. Let me follow u on twitter. But I do not have 365 subscription. I do have datacamp. Is it fine?
I already started learning Python from scratch again yesterday!! ü§îü§î I guess I'm reading your mind üò±üò±
"It's written by Abhishek Thakur who I had on the channel a couple days ago, actually"

*That's badass*
Ken is the one who always shows others light and make people have faith
Wow..great initiative.. Thanks Ken.
Discord or slack channel?
Let's go! #66DaysofData super excited and I'll be trying my best to follow along.
Hii Ken Jee, Me being at start of Data Science Journey, can definitely say that this journey with u will help us people like me, Definitely will join u along. Thanks a lot!!
I just obtained my Bachelor's in Business Management and became interested in Data Science a few months ago. 

I‚Äôm taking classes to pursue a second Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and will be cool; to follow you along with your restart on Data Science. I also purchased the 365 Data Science program because of your recommendation.
@Ken Jee I am just starting out on the data science path and would try to make the best out of this initiative. You definitely make an intimidating subject easy to follow. Thank you for your efforts!
Mad respect for doing this. I feel like you're the type of person who values being accountable to yourself.
For a long time I was thinking about building up my project portfolio.. but I was lacking a regular structure.. With this initiative I will probably get some structure and also get motivated to follow it. Thanks for starting it all over again üëç.
Feature Selection!! Loops!! and Matplotlib
I really want to follow on this initiative, but have a question. I have already taken the Kaggle micro courses (Python, Pandas, Data Visualization, and Intro to Machine Learning). Is that okay if I already have somewhat of a headstart? I am starting to learn now some machine learning, but with a different book. It is from O'Reilly and called Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (another book I can recommend and a bit tight on buying new books). Would that be ok?
This is so great. I really need to brush up and get motivated!
Really excited about this
I love this Ken, this is so thoughtful of you!!
Would be starting with you
Thanks for the recommendations Ken! I really appreciate it. I want to dive into machine learning, but my math and statistics knowledge are not good enough yet. Do you think the book Think Stats is a good book to learn statistics basics? After learning statistics, the book Hands On Machine Learning is good for beginners?
Thank you for this ! I‚Äôm want to learn Data Science but the boot camp is too expensive for me right now (17K) . I‚Äôm in a free camp for software engineering so I‚Äôm finally starting to learn tech . I hope next year with this and Coursea hopefully I can make my break in data science . There aren‚Äôt a lot of black people in the field it seems so I‚Äôm nervous üò©
Joining as well!
I am ready!!
literally sponsored by 365data lmao aint trusting
Looking forward to statistics part!!
You inspired me to take a peek at Abhishek's book.   Seemed legit.   Purchased!
Thank you Ken for these great resources!! You inspired me to start my data science journey. fastai also launched new free course recently, which is a great resource to learn deep learning.
really appreciate the back-to-basics reset.  thanks Ken!  looking forward.
i am so fucking pumped dude
I bought the 365 data science complete bootcamp on udemy. Would that work along with your initiative?
Hi Ken

Thank you so much, you came from havean for me.

I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....ü§™)

for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet.
my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero.

I found myself really taken by data science.
For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that)
check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors

Great Job HeroüèÜ

Believe me, Im cheering for you man, like you made a triple points with a big dunküèÄ.

 "Ken.. Jee  hoo hoo"üì£
 "Ken.. Jee  hoo hoo"üì£
 "Ken.. Jee  hoo hoo"üì£
Great initiative! Would there be a slack or discord channel where people who want to follow you on this journey can update?
For anyone thinking about learning the skills for a data science career, or even as a personal hobby, Johns Hopkins University created a pay-what-you-want training series of 11 courses targeting beginners. You do not have to be a complete novice to benefit from these courses; get your feet wet or whet your appetite - whichever analogy you prefer.  https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science
Hello Ken,
I think this is a really positive move!
Refreshing your knowledge is always something beneficial and I think this will be great both for you and of course
for your audience. 
Since I also wanted to widen my horizon for a bit now I'll try to take out that bit of time out of my day and learn as well! (I don't acutally use Twitter but I'll just keep track regardless)

Happy learning! :)
Commenting before the vid ends just to address the wink at 2:42. 
That was a nice touch lol.
Hey Ken! What about setting up a discord server so the community can better help each other and communicate! Thanks a lot for this man! Keep it up!
Hi Ken, could you post your daily work on LinkedIn as well besides Twitter?
#66daysofdata thats a fantastic idea Ken ! I was using Daniel Bourke's 42 day learning strategy, which worked so well for me. As a beginner, this strategy helped me to not waste time getting overwhelmed by the vast areas of topics to learn in data science. I just picked some basic projects to focus and learn using reverse engineering for 42 days and it was a fruitful endeavor. Looking forward to learn with you man ! :)
It's rare people accept the downsides publically... Good wishes Ken Jee..
Hey Ken
Thanks a lot for taking this initiative. I'll definitely join you up.
Just wanted to make a suggestion here
It'll be great if you can make a whatsapp group by the end of this course so that we can have a community of people on similar stag in their data science journey and they can  colobrate  from there and take it forward by doing more projects.
Again thanks for doing this! Really excited
Hey ken! I dont have twitter. Do you have a discord group where we can collaborate as a community, share progress, learn and motivate each other? :)
Bro, From Where Should I Start Software Development skills ie Excelling Python or From Mathematics or Directly Jump on To Data Science Concepts. Recently it has been over a Month or two fro me Programming in Python and I think I am at SOMEWHAT intermediate Level. Please Suggest Me..
I think one of the biggest obstacles of learning python is actually practicing the syntax and memorizing the many different functions needed to code. Any websites you‚Äôre using to practice the syntax/functions and solving given problems that are common when using python?
Thanks  a lot sir , for doing so much for us .

You are the best . üôè
let's go!
I can't thank you enough for this man!! I will be honest, I didn't have a friend to prepare for Data Science with and I was looking desperately for someone, and who he turned out to be, it was Ken Jee! The same person from whom I understood what Data Science basically is! And I owe you, big time man! Thank you, thank you so much!!!! 
I will surely keep you updated on my progress! Thank you once again, my man! Thank you!
Hi Ken! This initiative is amazing! Are you going to upload videos during the 66 days? Or just sharing the process through your Twitter account?
I am up.
Thanks, ken for sharing...excited to start the #66daysofData...one question from you WHY THERE ARE THREE CLOCKS ON THE WALL? JUST CURIOUSüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ... TO KNOW OR IT'S JUST  FOR A SHOWCASE!!!!
that wink at 2:37 should be the wink of the month
Will you also upload YouTube videos on what you are learning?
I was feeling stuck in my  learning, so this video is an excellent incentive to move forward with my projects.
The #66DaysofData learning / relearning initiative comes at the ideal time. I start a geospatial data analytics graduate-level program after Labour Day.
Twitter, why not LinkedIn??
Let‚Äôs do thisüòä
I'll be following! Thank you!
Hello Ken. looking forward to learning data science with you.
Hi Ken, this is so exciting for me. Really looking forward to this initiative and I just wanted to ask why twitter and not Linkedin? for posting the daily updates :) 
#66DaysOfData
Sir Please Improve some lighting; the light in video looks very dull.
I really don't need to start over, the first time is enough, haha!
please do the same in Instagram
Unofficial discord server: https://discord.gg/MCczub
Do reply with an official one if that exists, but for now, this will do
I am excited and looking for that üòç
@Ken Jee what are basic kaggle projects to do and learn
Discord will be great for this
What a irony ken sir !
Every time I wanted anything you made a video on it and I get solution of my problems.
Excited to join this with you. Hopefully 66 days becomes 6666 days :p
Waiting for this from a Long time..üëçüèª
Can you create a video comparing data science or fields of DS and Actuary
Soo excited
Can you add linear algebra as well? It is taught in Applied.ai course and I'm searching for resources to learn it and haven't found anyone yet...
Finally 66 days of data is here!!!!!?

I have started to upload #dataset on #kaggle

Hello Ken, great to see this. Do we have any prerequisites for this serie?
I have taken a Stats class, a Intro to Datascience class, and have some experience with R, is it enough to follow along. Thank you Ken üòÅ
Woo! Excited to follow along on this one :) Revising the basics will never be a bad idea. Let's do this!
want to start data science in the right path show us ken
Really looking forward to this!! I hope you can also touch upon how important it is to learn about deployment/pipelines, and if so, how we should go about it.
I'm so excited for this, patiently waiting ‚ú®
Just the thing I wanted.
Speaking of which, related to my comment below, a message for the followers of Ken jee:
How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses? And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :)
PS: a discord chat with voice might also be useful, and I am willing to help establish it, just in case :)
I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day (that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field) but als, recently, I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field. 
And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !!  :)
Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle "maelstrom" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map.
As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :)
And I assume when we, your followers and students, start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' ... well ... I am really hoping this will open doors for you, the best ones, just saying ;)
super excited ....lets rock it ken
Thanks for this amazing initiative, I would love to join, so much to learn, let me stock up on the books you suggested üòÅ
Really excited for this. Can't wait longer.
Why is Ken Jee playing dota for 66 days? üòÇ

Jokes aside. This is awesome. The value you give to the Data Science community is massive! Thank you very much üëä
Epic. much-awaited one
So excited for this! Please guide us to the right path Ken Senpai!
Wow, I'm just starting too. I'd love to join you on this. I'm currently working through the HarvardX cert (John Hopkin's lined up afterwards). I'll squeeze in your courses too as appropriate :)
Wow, really excited for this journey! #66DaysOfData
#66DaysOfData Let's do thisüî•üî•üî•üî•
Oh man !!! Looking forward to it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much ken , looking forward to it üòä
how long do you plan on grinding each day.
I have been following your tips
Its pretty good and promising
Favourite video is How I would learn data science (if I had to start over)
Can't wait for today's video.
Hi Ken !!
I have prior experience in analysis on excel . However , I consider myself as the beginner .
I recently acquire the knowledge of Python hope it will help me understand more efficiently.
Looking forward to it ......Thanks!!!
sweet mother of all that is good and pure!
Hello Ken, could you also mention the  important topics to learn sequence wise, 
like i am really confused about embeddings and models like BERT,GLOVE etc.
it would really help if you could explained " where they will be used " with few example in the video.

Thanks. 
Eagerly Waiting.
Hey Ken! Can beginners follow along in #66DaysofData as well? I'm really new to the field of data science.
I'm very excited to start the #66DaysOfData initiative on September 1! You can follow along with me and also participate on twitter (https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS ) !

Thanks for great videos ken‚ù§Ô∏è that helps alot
Hi Ken , thank you for the interview . Really useful for beginners like me . But please avoid the background music. It‚Äôs distracting.
I love how ken replies to every comment. Kudos Man.
I like the way you manage the interview, it goes smoothly. 
I appreciate what you are doing to the community you may have impacted many lives, God bless you.
Ken is a good person.
What do you mean by benchmarking your model? Great video!
Such an amazing interview! I‚Äôm an absolute beginner currently focusing on Andrew Ng Machine learning theory videos and then i‚Äôll jump into the kaggle.
Hi, I am a beginner. Could you please tell me how to check if my approach to a particular competition/problem is correct or not?
Thanks Ken for this podcast. It was certainly enlightening listening to the amazing discussion, lots of practical tips. üòÉ
Great guide and motivation for kagglers. Don't get disappointed with the low scores and never give up!
i just found out kaggle existed here! thanks alot ken
Hello ken jee‚ô•Ô∏è.. i am one of your old subscriber .. i just wanted to tell you that if you could make a video where you will take an interview of any fresher data scientist..like a proper interview. So please make such  video ... If anyone agrees plz give a like to let him know
Hey Ken, thanks for the great content.
Have you ever thought about uploading episodes like this as Podcast, too?
I think w/o any additional effort many would benefit from this, because Youtube2Go is not really functional.
Thank you Ken, this interview motivates me work very had data science with kaggle.
Awesome conversation guys :) All the tips around kaggle are pretty useful.
Again, just for the algorithms :) Awesome interview.
Where can I get Andrew Wang's Course?
Really appreciate the content and the interviews you're putting out. This honestly helps a lot, tweaking my own path.
i think it's motivational too since this field is wayyy more complex and the kaggle  community has grown a lot too. Thankyou!
I am just starting to do the beginner competition that you told about
Another amazing video. Thank you ken
This is GOLD! Thanks for the amazing content!
Nice Video Ken Thanks. This video is  such a motivational to become active on Kaggle.
11:04 A month. I am also starting my kaggle journey with titanic dataset and already spent 2 days into it. I was just thinking about for how many days I am gonna do this. I thought he was gonna say a week at most.
It's so informative and inspiring, Ken
Thanks for sharing üòä
Nice discussion !
Thanks ken for sharing this interesting interview...
@Abhishek Takhur one of DS leader
Love this interview, Ken. This video has motivated me to be more active and compete more on Kaggle!
Amazing! With every interview you just surprise me more and more! It is definitely relieving to hear that even people like him sometimes struggle with the data science ecosystem. Just goes to show that everyone struggles but it's still possible to come out succesfully (or even exactly because of the struggle)!
Great content! There are nuggets of serious gold in here
Great vid ken! This video is very informative for a kaggle beginner like me.
Thanks for the video Ken. Your videos help a lot!!
Keep it going Ken! Amazing content as always!
Love your content Ken! much love from South Africa üáøüá¶üî•‚ù§Ô∏è

2 of my favourite youtubers coming together
Special thanks again to Alexander! Again, if you would like your projects, resume's, or portfolio reviewed, please comment below and email me at kenjee.ds@gmail.com! 
My Resume Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsXWVPzwZPk
Alexander's Website: https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/
Tina's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww

Danny's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYPQz_qySbPESTK8k2ky5g
I want this website layout to make my data science portfolio 
How can I?
Is LaTex commonly used to write up a data science paper? If not, what software do practicing data scientists use? MS Word?
Thank you Ken for the detailed overview! I was wondering how Alexander embedded his project into the webpage? I saw your video on creating a Github Pages portfolio (led by Chanin the Data Professor) and I thought the way he integrated his project there is quite cool.
Is Alexander picking his nose in his profile picture? lol
Wow, he really does have a very impressive resume! The level of detail he put into his projects is just insane, especially for someone who even has a different background!

I think it would be great to see Tina and Danny review projects as well, that would probably give them more attention on this platform as well! ;)
Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. 

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen,Request
import pandas as pd 
import random
import pickle



headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3"}



website = "https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm"

for i in range(1):
    req = Request(website, headers=headers)
    page = urlopen(req)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
    for item in soup.select(".jobLink span"):
        print(item.get_text())


Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page.
Thank you ken jee,
I'm learning data science, your video inspired me, maybe i will make a blog to share my learning progress, difficulties because I am a beginner...etc.
Hi Ken,
Is freelancing a viable option for a data science career? Or do you have to stick with one company?
i feel bad about my projects now. this is amazing
Both review options sound good.
Amazing portfolio, 
Great review, Ken
Almost time for me to submit mine! 

Amazing portfolio and great review Ken!
Which is better internships or work as a freelancer ?
Thank you Ken so much for the feedback! I love what you're doing out here on YouTube, and love the critical feedback! You are more than welcome to share any of my projects or anything else.

I hadn't actually touched my website, or much of GitHub, all summer because I have been working a few research projects with my university, among other things, so this is great motivation to get back over there and update everything! You have also inspired me to start sharing more of my work with the world!
Why people dislike this? wtf
Good work, this reviewing projects series is really helpful.
Thank you Ken, This was really helpful :)
Congrats Ken on the 80k! Alexander's portfolio website looks really nice and clean. The Trivago project looks amazing. It is very nicely structured and goes into great depth into the underlying math as well as summarizing the key findings in several data visualization plots. It almost looks like a research paper, perhaps it would be nice to format it as a research paper (Key sections: Abstract, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results & Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgements, References) and upload to arXiv.org as a preprint, might even look good in the resume also üòÉ
Very nice! Employers will line up from now on ;-)
Good luck Alexander!
Do you have a video on where to start on your data science journey. I have less than one year to graduate from university and I‚Äôm majoring in data analytics. My university just recently made the data science major so I wasn‚Äôt able to declare it. I may just be overwhelmed... any help is appreciated!
I learned python during the quarantine. I also want to make projects that got me into the data science field though I'm not familiar with ml concepts, I'm learning them. I want some project ideas that I could add to my resume. Right now I'm doing some beginners level project like Titanic survival and wine quality one. But I want projects that could get me jobs. Any idea where I can search for them?
I‚Äôve been meaning to send you mine but I‚Äôm terrified of being roasted publicly

Title had me for a moment
it said 92 percent discount and i purchased it :)
Hey ken...what is your opinion about moving from data analyst role  to  more of manager role...also  how many  years of work experience should one have before the transformation(Is 2-3 years sufficient)?
Ken: 'Don't but my course...'
Me: Went ahead and purchased the course during watching the video!
loving your channel a lot ken! will definitely take your course once I brush up on basic skills and knowledge. keep it up man!
Thanks for updating the discount, unfortunately there is no way to buy it. The order form is not active.
I put this message here, since it's your last video. I was wondering if you will do a video on the following subject:

How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle.
And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform. 
I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). 
Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there. ( I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight :) ).

In any case, thanks for your youtubes videos :)
There is something wrong with your promotion. The yearly price is only 20% off, please correct and update
Your wholesome click-bait worked ! Just purchased your course on Udemy, it was on sale for $10. Thanks for making such a great resource. Cheers !
Watch on 1.25 speed thanks, great content :)
Is competitive programming good for data scientist and if someone has participated into it and got a good result so can he mention that in his/her resume?
So much respect for you, Ken! You are being transparent instead of hard selling like everyone else.
Judging by the amount of effort you put into organizing your thoughts and ideas and displaying them in your videos, I can tell you would make an excellent lecturer.
Thank you Ken for your contents. I recently got 365 data science course with your discount linküòÅ because I noticed some basic knowledge gap from learning in an unstructured manner. I hope to polish my skills and get a job before the year winds up. Thank you!
Thank you for being brutally honest. Respect.
Hey ken, if you ever plan to make videos teaching data science concepts or any sort of tutorials but you are struggling with time, try live streaming. It will save so much time of yours since you don't have to edit them  + you can interact with us guys more often.
Hi, ken. I really like your voice. I'm not a native English speaker and your video really helps me speak like a Data engineer. HAHA.
I'm doing my master's degree in Data Science/AI. Personally speaking, my college's courses and many resources like Andrew NG's lecture mainly focusing on mathematical theories. If there are courses about job seeking, it is really useful for me : )
Thank you for your awesome content!
So honest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi Ken, I saw your course in it as i had already bought a one year package. as my boot camp starts in a fortnight, i am desperate for time to get my machine leaning code done in kaggle datasets. i will go through your course after the bootcamp. i am currently undergoing kaggle mini-courses to get going. the new visualisation course in 365 also i on-holding it, lol. i watch your titanin walkthrough, several times, its great. but it is too high level for us beginners. i am trying the easier one on estonia. i wonder if you could do something like titanic on a much simplier dataset, for those really beginners out there and me. i like your voice, tone, speed. its really easy to understand. i like 365, its guide learners very well. but then we need more practise on datasets, there is where kaggle comes in. but its overwhelming for beginners too. there are too much to learn to roam around in kaggle, so i took the mini-course to learn how to get its data, and to submit. Thanks for the contents. i watch everyone of it
Dude I literally binge watched almost all your videos. Thank you so much for providing invaluable and informative information to the general public. I felt that this channel is especially invaluable with those who do not have the ability to attend a higher level institution. This channel clearly and concisely shows all the necessary steps and procedures to succeed in this field, which I greatly admire and appreciate. You're an actual legend, keep up the amazing work.
Love your honesty, those who save money because of this video will appreciate you a lot
Bought and video commented üëçüèªüòÇüòé
this guy is such a great lad, he's an inspiration for me at this point.
Production quality üíØüíØ Camera, mix, editing, speaking everything!! So much growth haha
Always be plugging! You have a great ethos from reading your comments (and what I think of you). Highlighting that your free content is already a great substitute is a great point to build trust. We support you!!
2:10  haha wow.

Great Video Man.
Is anyone else going to get the course just hear Ken's voice?? üôãüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ü§î I bought the course after watching a "Don't Buy My Course.." video
why don't you come live for solving any data science case study so that we can code and solve along with you the case problems and learn from your approach? I and my friends would love you to watch that, if possible for you. By the way, watched and loved your every content
you are very honest person in giving opinion, thanks
udemy courses are really affordable. my first intro to machine learning is via udemy. the good thing is that you can get answer of the questions. which is not in youtube
That is so honest and cool of course :)
In an environment where people just market their products without considering its actual value, there are a very few people who open up like this and be honest to their target audience. Ethics is very important!
Thank you for the awesome content as always! :)
damn ken i sooo humble man. love him.
Do you think this course can be done in a day, like 6 - 8 hours in total? Also, do you go through an in-depth analysis about python or is it just rudimentary information about python? I want to get better at my python skills.
What a great clickbait title, I like it :D
I haven't seen such honest personality in my life, who is thinking about people not about own 
Really appreciated your efforts
I wish your all dreams come true !!!!!üëç
I rarely leave comments on videos, but as someone working towards landing my first DS job, I‚Äôve found your content and channel extremely valuable. I also appreciate your candor and transparency.
My college is sponsoring all courses on Coursera till end of September and I'm completing courses and their assignments for about 6-8hrs a day. I have so many personal projects in mind which I wanna do but I'm not able to decide should I stop taking those courses and just do my projects instead? I'm learning new stuff all the time through those courses and they great. Currently completing the 'Applied Data Science with Python Specialization' and I plan on doing the Deep Learning Specialization after completing this one, what do you think I should do? Thanks for reading till the end.
I think we all would agree with that 7:31 üòÜIs that a Joby tripod I see in the background?  Awesome gear üòÉ
Telling these things on youtube honestly is a big task.
Thank you for guiding us sir
Ken, Thank you for your honesty and authentic interest to share the joy of your profession.  I will continue to watch your videos to determine my next steps. Keep up your great work!
will you provide certificate? how do you compare coursea vs 365datascience?
Nice work on the logo!
You're honesty/believability is is one of your strongest assets for this channel. Obviously, aside from your knowledge on the subject.
Bro if it wasn't for your content I wouldn't have a clue on how to break into DS. Without it I'd be completely lost, especially when it comes to sports analytics. I'll definitely be checking out your course. Thanks man
Master Ken jee course is thing that can actually help student. By paying little amount  for course student actually value the course more. ‚ù§Ô∏è Soon will join ur course ü§†
Hey Ken, surely gonna check out your course! Could you also do a course specifically for sports analytics??

Cheers!
Ken : "Don't tell Udemy..."
Also Ken : Uploads the video on YouTube where anyone can see it...
(loved your honesty btw ken)‚ù£Ô∏è
Ken is slowly turning into my favourite YouTuber. Thank you so much for your awesome content. Lots of love from üá≥üá¨üá≥üá¨
This man is immensely underrated. You are awesome, Ken.
Hey Ken,
to be honest, I (sort of) knew that you were working with 365,
but I didn't know that you created an entire course for this.
It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible!
I think this course will really benefit a lot of people.


Btw: If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and
basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door,
especially for more of a machine learning engineering, rather than DS role, do you think this course would be a good fit?
( Maybe I'll buy it anyway tho, just to support you ;) )
Love your channel and your honesty. You're an inspiration. ALLAH BLESS YOU
I plan on buying this just to support you for all the information you've given me, not just related to data science but the way you really break down the ins and outs of the day to day data science processes.  You have impacted so many people and will continue to do so (hopefully) for a long time.
Is it worth it to Learn C as someone who knows R , is familiar with Java and Python. currently I am focusing on Python.
I've always appreciated your honesty from day 1 and it's one of the reasons why I love watching your videos! üòÑ
Such an honest review! üî•

This interview looked like a struggle lmao. Ken we see you yawning with your mouth closed ü§£
It's so comforting to know, people like him with no phds and masters and years of working hard could land a job by just focusing on  for the next five months. Love this ken! Thank you so much
I simp for this shirt ken, it looks great on you @.@
I love the story about how he follows up with the CEO.  I never knew that was even a possibility to do, even though it makes total sense.  Great job.
Ken - Thanks a ton for the prompt response!  I figured I'd reply to your message in the new comment field - I've had difficulties posting replies to replies off comments in the past.  It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field.  Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field.  Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem.  I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc.  Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's.  While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire.  
With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go?  Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics?  Indeed includes many Data Analyst positions where at least an Associates is preferred.  I've also read articles stating that holding a Bachelor's is virtually a necessity in terms of getting one's foot in the door as a data analyst.
Thanks again for your inspiring channel.  I look forward to combing through all of your videos as I attempt to traverse this arduous journey to becoming  a seasoned data scientist such as yourself.
Thank you for the insightful video.  I do have a few questions that have been lingering on my mind: would it be beneficial for a 36-year-old - who works full time - to at least pursue an associates in math and/or comp sci?  Perhaps blend that with taking edX/Data Quest/365 DSM?  I've been messing around with some Kaggle projects as well.  
Thanks again.
Very insightful. I wish you could interview a family woman who succeeds in getting her first data science job.
Motivating update from future Ray to whomever is reading: I just got promoted to Lead Solutions Engineer! I‚Äôve been at this company for 7 months and coding for less than a year, so keep going, you got this!
Is there anyway to get a recruiter to notice you if you dont have any aquaintance or friends who are recruiters?Thanks in advance
I'm doomed :(  I have experience as a business analyst, now Im learning SQL, but to be honest, I always go really bad at maths and logical exams. If they ask you to do these exams even with you proving that you can do the job, then I'm doomed. Really sad!
This video is so informative, thank you for sharing! I was wondering, what's the best format to upload projects on LinkedIn? Would you create posts or add them to experience?
Nice video! Can you please make more videos like this one?
Stop with the impostor syndrome Ken! ;) your content is good and you seem to be a very nice person, smart, down to earth and encouraging. No wonder your channel is growing! ;)
This is interview has many great insights, I'll be implementing some of these in the near future.
Hey, what are the books mentioned around 31:44 by the speaker and Ken
After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.  Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions.  Thanks again!
This video was a huge shot of motivation. I've been using the past couple of months to begin my own journey towards working in the Data Analytics field since losing my job to COVID. This interview was extremely helpful in reinforcing some of the things I was already doing as well as making me aware of the things I wasn't. Congratulations to Ray on his success in breaking into the Data Analytics field and thank you to Ken for providing such helpful content in this area.
Great interview! Totally up for the 66 days of Data challenge!
Thanks for posting
I'm excited about the 66 days of data idea. Really helpful interview.
Any advice for someone who can't afford to finish their degree right now(I have 3 years of applied mathematics).
I so needed this right now.Thanks for including people on this side of the spectrum,the beginners!
Can someone who‚Äôs not so good with Maths go for data science career path
What was his resources again data camp and data class ..?where will I get it?
Big fan of your show and the guidance you provide.  Interviews like this are extremely helpful for those of us looking to get further into data science, both from a motivational perspective (someone did it, here's proof) and an instructional perspective (here's a way someone did it, it worked for them, here's why and how).  Thank you again for doing this.
I'm doing the Data Science Professional Certification by IBM on Coursera. What's your opinion on it? I really hope it's worth it. I'm at course 5 out of a total of 9. Started just 1.5 months ago and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of topics I need to learn. One thing that really bothers me is that I don't know how deeply I need to understand a particular topic. For example, python. Numpy, pandas, etc. How much of it is required to be able to work effectively with data? Any suggestions Ken?
i loved the 66 days part, look forward to it
Thats a great video. I have been following your channel and love your work and its precise content. Inspiring me in my data science path.Great Stuff.Thank you Ray Ojel for sharing your journey. Its of great help! Thanks Pal! And all the very best!

Thanks Ken.
What he said about "not understanding Kaggle notebook" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science.
When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work. 

All that is to say: be patient, keep learning and keep tinkering with datasets. It's a marathon not a sprint. You will be surprised by your progress. :)
Really insightful study. Learning on my own to be a data analyst. I got some inspiration and also how to go about my learning plan. üëçüëçüôè
Awesome and inspirational video. Let me continue my practicing journey as i wait for your 66 days of data video.
feeling so much positive , thanks ken jee
What would you recommend for learning Excel skills for Data Analysis (some book or course, doesn't matter)? Learned Basics of Python/IPython, NumPy, started Pandas and then checked vacancies in my country and find out that for Entry Level in Data Analyst usually required Excel (pivot tables, DAX formulas, Power Query) and SQL (+ PowerBI, but it usually not in "must have section").
As always, great material!! I really found this helpful & inspiring.
This is quality content, Ken! Thank you for this. This is really inspiring. I am on a similar path. Also congrats to Ray on landing the job.
Amazing video Ken! I was messaging you on LinkedIn other day!
Man there was so much to learn from this video. Really loved the part about Ray following up on the question he missed, never thought about it this way. Also, recently I've been reading some books about habit building too (Atomic Habits by James Clear currenty), trying to focus on habits and being consistent with my practice of data science. I believe that the 66 days of data science will be a great initiative.
hey, Ken Jee why are there 3 clocks behind you?
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
this is so relevant. im a recent math graduate and im also learning python to work towards a data analyst job. thank you for sharing!
Inspiring conversation.
Great Interview it's what I needed right now.
It's amazing, Ken
Keep connecting, Keep pushing, Keep learning
Motivated :)
Great interview! I really enjoyed hearing his story.
Hey that‚Äôs me üòÉ
Great Video Ken, Thanks , in my other Channel ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY5_YVQHrto&t=37s) I have reviewed DataCamp and DataQuest courses ( in Arabic and in English) and I agree with him , DataQuest content is much better than DataCamp.
This video has so much great advice for anyone seeking to break into the data science field.  Great content as always, Ken!
Though it's late night (1:52 AM ) but spending time watching this was worth enough.
I realize that if your background is in math or statistics you learn the programming part fairly easy since there are many packages etc but on the other hand if your background is CS/software, learning math/stats take more time to catch up with.
If anyone can afford only one platform, which one to choose; DataCamp, DataQuest, 365DataScience? Please provide your suggestions.
I have also been learning on Dataquest and about to finish the Data Analyst path.
This gives me hope. Let's keep learning and pushing.
People are not able to start their careers in this field.

Companies are not ready to invest their time on new incoming talents instead they want the ones with the excellent skills set and experience in the field. While almost all the tech companies have their own Data Science departments, the others which do not have one, need a person with a lot of experience in this to start one.

What is your opinion on this Sir, Correct me and suggest me ?
Cool, that's a good plan #60DaysDataInsight
Yooo!! I think remember reading this guys comment here! Congrats Ray!
Learning from other code examples is definitely very helpful in my opinion as well. Sometimes you just need to see a hands-on example of a function being used and it just clicks. Knowing someone on the inside surely is helpful and that my network is something I want to put in more effort into as well. Thanks for the review! Very interesting to see the perspective of someone who also follows this channel.
Nice video ken!

Also one suggestion, please try to add links to questions asked/key points in video which will be easy for us to go through the video quickly!!!

Thanks!!!!
do the 66 days of data science...as a part of your youtube community I would love to be held accountable by your videos and updates :) - from a subscriber stuck in tutorial inferno :/
Greatly inspiring video for me Ken. Keep it up.
Shit 5 months is quick? So in the meanwhile what do you do? Work at Mac Donald‚Äôs or live with your parents?
Is RegEx really that important for NLP/Text mining in data analytics?
If it is then how can i master it?
Hey I‚Äôm an SJSU studying Business Analytics, I would love to get my github/linked in to get reviewed if possible.
I watch your video twice or thrice in order to properly get the wisdom you r trying to convey. 

Again, 
Great work.
Damn just 10 min ago i was watching your video and saw this guy's comment on it and after few minutes found this video üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Funny thing: Back in my interview (Data Science) I was being asked a similar question referring to index values.
Very interesting talk (Especially the barrier/momentum discussion). Thank you for this.
Good luck on your first day Ray! You have a great and positive attitude.
I liked the video first.. then I watch it hahahaha
Keep posting
Never clicked so fast.
Thanks for watching ev;eryone! Special thanks to Francis for submitting his work! If you would like to have your project, resume, portfolio, or LinkedIn reviewed please comment below and send me an email at KenJee.ds@gmail.com

Help me out here, 
I'm gonna complete my Degree (CSE dept.)
I want to do my carrier in Data Science field.

I have pretty much of knowledge of data science but not so exactly,

What steps should I take now and after completing my degree ? 

Should I do Post Graduation in Data Science or learn by myself ? What is best for me ? Please guide me
Amazing review . üôåüôå kudos to Francis üî•
Thank you very much Ken for the review, I'm definitely going to apply all the corrections and strongly consider all your suggestions! Thank you very much Man! I really appreciate it.
Hey Ken can you tell me how can I collect such types of interesting data ( likely as the whatsapp one ) , from instagram or Spotify. :) Thanks alot.
Great video Ken! Generally, Francis‚Äô project was well implemented, great job. Also thanks Ken for the shoutout üòÑ
Another awesome video, Ken! Learned a lot on how to tell better stories with data. By the way, your new GitHub profile README is looking good as well :)
What's your opinion on putting class projects on github along side one or two of my own projcets? I am now a sophomore and have only started to do my own projects completely on my own. I want to start applying to interships, but feel that only one or two projects of my own is two little.
Nice review! Nailing the fundamentals is definitely the most important thing when it comes to portfolios (or projects in general).
I also love how Francis used DS to analyze an actual situation of his life, I will definitely put that on my idea list!
Also gj on updating your GitHub-Readme! ;)
Great video. Can you link the tutorial you mentioned regarding adding the word cloud to an image?
Make a video on how are you selecting the video for review, are you using any sampling technique for the same :) Thanks for the work and share man keep posting
Please made video on sports analytics
As both a creator and data scientist, thanks man!   Great stuff!
YouTube is well known in its recommender system to favor content with lots of engagement.   As a result, consider the like button of this particular video SMASHED ;)
Like Bayesian probably
I truly loved your video. thanks a lot. it was so clear and concise.
Thankyou so much for this information Ken‚ù§Ô∏è
No doubt you told everything about it but I'll also read the paper‚ù§Ô∏èü§©
Thanks for breaking this down for everyone! One thing that caught my attention is about the sad truth - so technically you can find viral videos and basically duplicate them with same tags and it works?!
Wow thank you !
This was actually really helpful! I‚Äôm researching for my own future channel, but I‚Äôm thinking about making a program that takes samples of YouTube videos, and samples yours and marker what similaritys it had on low viewed and high viewed videos.
3 things:
1. CAPTIVATE and DIGITAL MINIAMLISM are great. I aim to read the rest on your shelf.
2. ooooo alchemy
3. thanks for sharing such VALUED content. Keep it up!

cheers!
Awesome tips! Thank you! Will implement that on my channel))
I can't completely say that this is relatable to the video's topic but theres a website called invidio.us where you are able to know the percentage of engagement, rating, family rating, and also the wilson score of any video. For any the data analysts out there, I guess this can be a bit helpful to analyse your video's status. :)
Hi Ken
I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.

So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific.
Link - https://github.com/2000siddharth/web_scraping_classification/blob/master/EDA_YT.ipynb

Thanks for always making amazing content.
Thanks for sharing, i found your channel 6 months ago and your video's have definitely improved!
Does the dislike button hurt or help creators?
This channel makes data science more easy to digest piece by piece in an interesting way! Also how old are you at this point and what age did you get your sports analysis job? Just need to get a relative idea of my progress lmao
Really well done!
Comment :)
Oh no, now I'm going to get video recommendations on how to beat the algorithm...
What constitutes the end of the video? I know some Youtubers put their ads/sponsorships at the end of the video but if someone doesn‚Äôt watch that last part of the video because of the ads is that the end of the video? I know the ending screens can take up the last 10 seconds of the video so is it one minute till the end of the video or 10 seconds to the end of the video.
This is a compelling content. I have been watching a lot of videos that say it is just about the algorithm. Yours is different.
Is there a way to to confuse the algorithm to shuffle random videos instead of the learnt pattern?
great stuff ken, I would love to see an interview of YT data scientist...
amazing move at 1:37
funny that the YouTube algorithm recommended me this video
Great video man! 
I am curious to hear your definition of 'maximising reach' as it was one of the key takeaways but was seemingly brushed over?
Funnily enough, I literally found this video on my recommendations from the algorithm you just explained XD. In all seriousness, this is great content as always
Thank you very much for video Ken!!! I'm a Data Scientist, and I was really curious about how the YouTube algorithm works.
Putting in good work man!
I would love to see an interview with a YouTube Data Scientist
Hey Ken! Kind of a random question but, in an interview, how would you go about describing a data science project you did that involved web scraping (in particular the ethics of it)? Big fan!
Commenting for the algorithm
Great video Ken. Do you happen to know if when you use a multi-word keyword like "Data Science Tutorial" will it be part of the search result for the term "tutorial" or do you have to have a separate keyword for "tutorial" by itself also.
Haha I always love those 2010 random recommendations. Great video as always!
I'm sure there is more to the algorithm. I have a video on my other account sitting for 2,5 years and it's been pretty stable in views. The key is - it was searched for explicitly. It worked actually even after the 3 days you mentioned.
just commenting to beat the algorithm. great stuff!
Awesome video! The throwing of the research paper was hilarious! For all the advises that you are giving, you are practically demonstrating them in action, amazing üëç
I've recently been learning about recommender systems and It's interesting to know how YouTube's algorithm works, especially when dealing with the cold start problem. Great video, Ken!
Thanks for great content, Ken! Can you make a video about math: what kind of math do you use in job, what part of math is need to know necessarily?
Regarding your insane growth rate you definitely cracked the YT-Algorithm.
KEN JEE Problems:
3:34 -> 64k 
Growing that fast that your subscribe button is not up to date :-D
Hope you get the opportunity to interview a DS from YouTube!
Can you ask him/her if they have noticed any (adverse) effects of optimising to boost the viewing time on the long term engagement of a user?
Ken giving a tip on how to keep people watching till the end and at the same time giving an example by telling us some insights will be given in the end ...Brilliant üòÇ
Great details!
I loved the visual explanation you put in at 3:44 and when you threw the paper into the back I could not supress a small laugh :D
Excellent and very innovative content!
Awesome man!!!

I want to be in lawn tennis as a data scientist/analyst/ sports analyst do you have any suggestions?
Great interview!
I am planning to start my masters in busienss analytics during fall 2021. What would my course of plan be right now? 

What should I start with first? Programming or maths or excel or reporting tools??
üòÇ I definitely used screenshots of tables in business school. Glad to see you having fun. Just purchased your course on Udemy.
Ken Jee, have you some book or video about sport analytics to learn more about this field ? thank you
Hey Ken i sent you an email. I'm the guy from twitter sry fr bothering u EveryehereüòÖ
Ken Jee, the data science quality content steamrolling machine :D
Great seeing all of those different perspectives on the topic!
Never knew there were Data Science streamers!  The more platforms the community has the better!
Im confused of what i want to study.  Im good at math , physics, and chemistry which makes it harder for me to choose. I already know that i want to do something with STEM. My options till now are data science, computer science , mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. I have learned the basics of python till now but dont know how to go further.
Great !! Thanks ken !!
Haha I love the fact when I google his name and twitch 'nick wan twitch' the first thing is Nick Wan Doesn't Drink....already hooks me in! Great content as always!
Hi, Ken! Great interview!

At 49:42, you mentioned something that I found really interesting. Namely, that there might be a potential divide of data science jobs in the future. Do you happen to know any other sources (blog posts, YouTube videos etc.) that talk about that idea in more detail?
At first, I thought Twitch was only for gamers, I was wrong, it is also a great platform for data science! Truly innovative and great value Nick is bringing to the community üòÉüëçüëç

Awesome !!
Special thanks to Shile for sending in his work! Please comment below if you would like to have your projects reviewed and send me your work at kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
what are the courses we should  do which related to finance and tools we should learn
3:10 does coursera courses add up to it?
Hello, What is a reputable online certification program for Data Science? Thanks.
Noice
Im interested in this domain. I am considering taking UPenn's Coursera specialization on business foundation which includes some finance courses. They also have one on modeling. Also, I have found a Udemy course on quant finance concepts. Do you think this is a good approach to build my resume along with projects and networking
Interested in the review I will email
Wow üò≥ this is exactly what I needed to see
Damn, I got a long way to go before I can start applying. Well done Shile!
The code for getting all tickers is very nice! I had to go through this some months ago as well and didn't find helpful resources on that.
Additionally the code is understandable commented. 
Thank you both Ken and Shile for sharing!
array length 889 does not match index length 418"-i am getting this error while executing the following code in titanic  project .

Here's playlist of workshops from a school club if anyone was interested in catching up to what I know https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMSih0au9SsDWnhClQbJLIYnJW9rgILfx
Hi Everyone! Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks for the awesome video content like regular, Ken. You've really been starting to upload very frequently about practical data science content, and your subscriber count has become indicative of that. It really helps newbies like me try to get into data science.
It's interesting to see resumes from different sectors! I think that can help people trying to get into that specific sector. Just in general I think this is a really great series! Also: *Reminder for you to update your GitHub start-page* ( I did update mine this week too! ;) )
Hi Ken , what tools and libraries I should use to become a financial data scientist and can you recommend some good resources for learning.
Thanks Ken for another awesome video! Clean and nice looking resume üëç
Hey ken! Would you prefer julia over python?
I want to do a risk related project but I‚Äôm having trouble finding inspiration
Always catching up new ideas from every videos, Thanks, Ken :)
Always waiting for new videos in this series. Thanks for emphasizing the importance of domain specialization, Ken! I‚Äôll definitely need to work more on that.
wow :)
Thanks for watching everyone! To clear things up, the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of. If someone simply has this in their repo, that is not as big of an issue, but it should be cited there if they are applying for jobs. Plagiarism is a serious issue in data science. Hopefully this could help clear things up!
If u copy someone‚Äôs work ur just cheating yourself
Thank you Ken as always! Just going to post my first project and yes I am going to cite everything. Contrary, I feel good giving credit because the project helped me a lot to learn. And I should write a para about how A YouTuber named Ken Jee is helping me for free without asking for any credits :p. Thank you. You made my day I hope this comment makes yours :D
Great video sir, I want to know how exactly can we cite others work if we used their work in our projects?
We need "fork" button on arxiv üòÇ
Thanks for sharing. I want to know what kind of projects should be done in order to get Data Analyst/Business Analyst roles?
Happy I learned how to properly document code from your by scratch series!  Was a big help.
This happened to me too.
I hope you read this bro.. the course 365 data science that you had described in your vlog information is showing only 20% discount not 47% can you check on this TIA.
Plagiarism can't exist in the IT world. If you have a dataset and you need get some data out of it.. there are maybe 25 solutions. Even if people don't know each other they can have the same solution and or have the same way of writing code. In the past i had idea. Didn't talk about it or publish it. I was working on it and about 2 years later(was not done yet) a big company came with the same thing.. I have tried to prove that i came with the idea first. But it didn't held up in court.
I love the new lighting, really ups the professionalism of the channel
I care very much about getting and giving due credit as it is about humility. Giving credit is hard, especially if that person will get ahead faster than I will. Getting credit is hard because it depends on other people giving credit!
Hey, Ken! I hope this situation didn't hurt you too much. I see a lot of people who are trying to catch a job with any methods and doesn't think about consequences of theirs actions. I think it's kind of struggle for survive.  So don't be upset, we are with you ;)
Thanks for the video, I have two questions though if someone don't mind answering 
1. Let's say I did a project without knowing someone else on the net did something similar to my projects, is it plagiarism ?

2. And if I get ideas from some others projects but codes are not copied at all ? Is it plagiarism ? Or what if I got inspiration from a project but did something completely different from what that project is ? Should I even cite the resources I got the inspiration even though the project is different ?
The same things happen in other branches of science, or probably worse. Intellectual rights of an ordinary people are never respected.
You mean to say that plagiarism isn't wrong but not giving credits to the source is wrong  ?
Elon musk said that when we go to the depth of the problem and ask questions and slowly the layer unveils than we truly know whether the person has truly done it or was just part of the major project.
Hi Ken, if I copy snippets from your notebook where exactly do I give you credits? In the first cell of my notebook or the last one? And do I just mention your name or do I also add a link to your notebook?
Me too...
Hello Ken, how can a beginner like me get the most out of GitHub?. I want to enter the data analytics job field one day and I have been doing self-learning.
I‚Äôm gonna plagiarize that haircut
Great clarification Ken. Not only for Data Scientists but also for other professions. In the world we're living today plagiarism is easy to do and I believe that most people do it without realising so clarifying this is important üëç
Thank you very much Ken. Very valuable lesson!
Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.

The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.

If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.

The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? 

The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence?
Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.

I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said, "You can wipe your axx with the Ethics. In youtube world this makes no sense."
Welcome to the 21th century guys.
Glad you made me clear about this issue. While learning from notebooks in Kaggle and other sites I feel so low to use someones codes. But I see this is common and a quite learning approach. The thing that I shouldn't do is just not publish it as my own . Thank you for clearing up my thoughts.
Sir I have a bid confusion in field.of data science so please can you provide me your mail ID?
FOR THAT in will be grateful to you
How did you find out that he copied ?
awesome video!!
I finished IBM's Data Science specialisation course on coursera few weeks ago. The capstone project is peer-graded. I can assure you that there were plenty of  students who simply copied and uploaded others' work. It was utterly disgusting.
Thanks a lot for bringing up a serious topic! Plagiarism can easily happen when coding and you pointed out very important stuff. Hopefully people have a better understanding of plagiarism now!
Love how you always get straight to the point! So sorry to hear that this happened to you. Would you even write the source if you got some code from Stack Overflow? I probably should start doing that huh...
With Siraj the real nail in the coffin was how badly he plagiarized that deep learning paper by replacing mathematical words with nonsense words (complicated hilbert spaces, haha). I understand why people lie when there's little chance of getting caught. I don't understand when people do it in a situation where they will almost certainly be caught.
Bravo üëèüëèüëè
Love the dramatic beginning hahaha already know it's going down 
It's great you took such an ambiguous topic and broke it down with rights and wrongs. Really important to highlight the consequences too. Great video!
Thanks for clearing that up Ken that‚Äôs sucks man. It really is important even when following your guides here on YouTube that you get the credit you deserve!
Hey Ken, I'm very new to programming. I followed along with your Glassdoor Project (reproducing it for the UK). I attempted every section myself before looking at the approach you took for each step of the DS pipeline. But when I was stuck (As this was my first end to end DS project -  this happened a lot) I referred back to what you did. Here is a link to my repository: https://github.com/TobiAdeniyi/glassdoor_proj

Is the referencing Okay??
The results in the table are in question marks because it takes ~1 hour to run all the models.
DS loves pandas and set it as background! Maybe green color helps to protect your eyes.
Time
This is a pretty insightful topics in terms of originality regarding projects. Now in terms of the "finding the same dataset someone used and using different algorithms to do some analysis", wouldn't that also kind of include people using common datasets from Kaggle in that case since it's the biggest source for data science projects?
I think some of this comes from being badly informed on proper protocols for giving credit (just because something is freely available on Github doesn't mean it's free for anybody to just grab as their own with no strings attached), and poor mechanisms for dealing with the understandably great pressure some face in the field.   Doesn't make it right, though I agree with you that I doubt it typically comes from ill intentions.

On an unrelated note.... I think it's "sy-kit learn", not "sick it learn".   "Sick it learn" sounds like a modern experimental metal band or something ;)
I have a question in regards to your work being original and you having the ability to do it yourself and that being important to employers. So with the web scraper example, would you say that an employer would say that you maybe don't know how to do that? Would they rather you go through and write it out fully yourself, which would've substantially increased the length of that project. And of course, you knew it well enough to modify it. And I will be clear, I am not saying that you should copy it without giving any credit. But if you did what you did, would an employer say you don' t understand. I hope that made sense... Thanks, I appreciate your channel!
If I did want to site your work from your data science project from scratch video, what exact steps would I have to take? Like what is the format for citing work?
Hello, I am from Iran. Could you please guid me to learn a programming  language to find a job In Canada?
I had no idea you get more credit having shared that you are using non-original sources. Super counter intuitive at first‚Äî but makes sense
Ken- great example of how handling a problem maturely brings you a net benefit.

Let‚Äôs assume you freaked out, put this guy on blast‚Äî and moved on.

You‚Äôd feel worse, and I (VERY green data scientist trying to learn the ropes) wouldn‚Äôt have learned this valuable lesson!

Your ability to calmly walk through the pros and cons helped out a lot of beginners‚Äî and I‚Äôm sure you feel better having taken mature action.
Would be great if you went through a project showing how to site work etc ... later down the road showing best practices.
While I think it is an important conversation I should point out that most of what you described is not plagiarism. It is more intellectual property violations.  I think technologists have become so accustomed to software reuse that the lines have been blurred. I agree with the principal of your commentary just pointing out the legal distinction in hopes of focusing the discussion into the appropriate arena  of IP and open source licencing.  Thank you for your content I do enjoy watching it.
So if I used someone else‚Äôs algorithm with totally different datasets, I should cite the person on my project right?
Finally somebody called it out. Thanks
You mean you got sirajed üòâ
Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall.
I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. 
My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault.
This is a very important topic, I agree!
As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general,
however it is important to credit the people correctly.
Some people may think "I could have written that code myself", which can of course be true in some situations,
but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature.
If you use a normal sentence such as "the weather was nice" obviously you don't need to quote anyone.
But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source.
Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code
stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in
tech than it is in literature.
Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!

Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!
Thank you ken! I know how you fell
do you pop a Xanax before every video?  Have some inflection in your voice
Thanks for the info bro...
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
what do you think is the future of Data Science jobs? Will jobs remains with all this autoML,pretrained model etc and so many people getting training in ML?
Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? 
Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful.
Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much "me" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the "life" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist.
Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond. And again, thank you for making these videos, they are a huge help.
It's nt a issue until and unless they are using ur codes in learning channels and earning money. 
Becoz ultimately even if they get DS/DA jobs by showing your codes they will definitely struggle to carry out data scientist role and threw out of organization üôÇ
One of the first things I look for when interviewing data scientist is whether their work is original. Great video!
Valuable Information as always.. I love that Panda Wallpaper üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è.
The pc build in the background üòç
I have seen this quite a lot. Some articles I had read turned out to be plagiarized as well. Sorry that it happened to you.

Great session , everyone knows how nvidia is acing in AI researches
let's just hope this isn't just another diversity hire, happens too often these days
This woman made a list of people she wanted to cancel. https://web.archive.org/web/20201214233656/https://twitter.com/AnimaAnandkumar/status/1338282250614411264
Thanks Ken for the awesome interview. I love it, learning a-lot from your interviews. I am also new and creating podcasts for data. We also feature interesting industry leaders including folks from Spotify, Uber, and Petco.
Very inspirational!
Wonderful interview Ken, quite insightful
I only watch videos about AI if there is actual tangible content in them (image completion, generation, nlp, nlp, nlg etc)
Love these interviews please do more of these videos!
researchers or innovators?
How do you deep teach the background cropping around Amina?
Thank you for the Interview. <3 it
Great interview.
"Bridging the gap between the industry and academia", that's my take away. Amazing! Thank you, Ken.
What do you think is the future of data scientist? Will there be roles 
for data scientist in the future with gpt-3,AutoML, improved transfer 
learning models. And with so many online resources and people getting 
into it?
Absolutely legendary. Amazing video to the both of you!
14:00 We need to separate State and education so there is no money to hide in the Education industry. Instead Education needs people from Industry to teach, so it is directly from the Job market what is being taught.
It is great seeing interviews with so many awesome people in the field!
I definitely agree with Anima on the learning part. Having a great theoretical basis and a good amount of practical experience is probably the ideal combination!
Also congrats to the winner(s) of the Jetson Nano and swag! 
I think Po is a really cool name for the PC! :D
Thanks for sharing amazing stuff, helping and encouraging @Ken,
Focusing on making foundations strong :)
13:20
Thanks for bringing an insightful interview with Anima. Glad you also brought up this question. I really agree with her opinion entirely. Hope this will inspire the academic instructors to bring more interesting courses for their students
Now we need her in Lex Fridman interview.
Great video.
Great Content.
Amazing thank you
Really great interview guys!!!
6:00 problem with gradual approach from experience is, it requires managers that care about probability and statistics. In Economics one is often faced with the demand (from business people) for just The Answer. Probability is seen as cowardice. This view is luckily fading.
I really enjoyed listening to this while I was working. Listening to interviews always opens up so many more avenues to learn more too so I'm glad I tuned in.
do you have a podcast?
Wow such an inspirational video. Finishing the video, I just ran into seeing her full bio and got so much amazed and inspired. Certainly there are more than just building models and implementing it. I am in my 3rd year undergrad. And needed a proper guidance about what to choose between research and industry. This video helped me a lot to get a good intuition. Thanks a lot.
Finally you started to bring amazing people 

Eagerly Waiting for entrepreneurs.......
Seems she has some Indian History.
Excellent Insights! Great to hear someone who is implementing these concepts in their everyday work!!
Great conversation. I loved the content discussed. The maturity of AI hardware among other aspects is going to be the one of the most promising future topics, I mean look at IPUs, FPGAs, TPUs , etc. in addition to great Nvidia & upcoming datacenter AMD GPUs. I love her personality! Thanks Ken for making this interview happen :)
Great Video, keep doing the great work and I am pretty sure one day will come when you will be getting interviewed just like that as Legend of DS and AI. üëè
You're growing so fast in terms of subscribers and I'm loving that because there is no any data science Youtube channel that's growing this fast and I hope that you'll be hitting 100k subscribers very soon this year
Gained a lot of insights from this interview, Ken! I love how Anima explained AI and ML in an interesting way.
...maybe a raffle for a free DGX for one you subscribers? :D Just a suggestion...
üßê
so eager and excited ...
I hope next one will be ceo of nvidia haha, but I'm really excited for this one
I can't wait! This is my aspiring field
Wow üò≥ okay, need to watch this!
Super excited for this one!  I used Nvidia style GAN to generate character game armor.  Really love their stuff! Thanks for always brining awesome content man!
Special thanks again to Talha! If you would like your projects reviewed, please send your links to kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
Hello sir,

I regularly go through your videos on data science. As you said you follow some precoded template (coding) for most of the projects. 

Rather than the GitHub code. Could you please share some  of your advanced codes for Data science projects (python).


Thank You
I'm a beginner,
How much machine learning theory, hands on do I need to dive into Deep learning ?

One doubt please clear this,
I have knowledge of ML, any other technical knowledge, and I want to do my carrier in DS field.
But I don't have any certificates.
I'm a final year CSE engineering student.
I need to place in company,
What steps should I talk ? Please help
Do you think using Kaggle as portfolio projects is a good idea for data science projects?
@Ken Jee Hey Ken, I'm 30 and i'm considering really getting into data science and machine learning after going through the field on and off over the last couple of years. Would you say it's pretty late for me to get into the field? Can you suggest ways that late-comers into the field might find an edge for themselves? What would you say or advise as an employer or someone hiring new data scientists? What would make an older applicant/late-comer more of an attractive employee or colleague compared to younger applicants?
Appreciate the content thank you so much!
is BS a good degree fro landing a job in the field of data science
This is perfect videos
Hi Ken, I've been watching your content for a while now, and I love what you put out. Thank you for the videos. I do have a small request. Could you perhaps remove the background music in your videos? Sometimes the music comes off as irritating and given that the main content of your videos is the dialogue, I feel like it's unnecessary to have the background music for the type of videos you make. Keep putting out the great content! I'm learning a lot from you :)
Ken, you're look smart bro <3
This review was üî•just like your haircut!
Excellent üëåüëçüíØ‚úîÔ∏è
Ken Jee series >>> Netflix
Focusing on my GitHub readme these days üòÅ, you look üëå, Ken
this hairstyle is also good but your previous one was better.
Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. 
Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon. 
PS: If you can please tell what name you decided on for your new PC

Once again thank you for making these videos, I cannot stress enough how helpful they are!
Watching your videos and observing them is really helping me with the workflow and approach towards my projects
awesome video...
fboy haircut \m/
Commenting code is just like data cleaning, the one part of the process no one likes to do xD.
Great review! Combining fields is something I never really thought about but that is really great advice! 
The new haircut looks nice as well ;)
This is just what I needed to improve my GitHub READMEs. By the way, looking fresh with the new haircut, Ken!
Great video Ken, the projects are awesome with a biomedical focus, I'll definitely look into this. Cool haircut by the way!
Great video
Oh yeah, loved your haircut.
Literally the first thing that got my attention was the haircut. Fresh start to the video already
Please keep this series coming! I am way behind and need to catch up‚Äî but Im very excited to have the time to go through all of these.
Thanks for watching everyone! I recommend watching this video next about how to get data science experience without a job: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWVQ0vN5uig
Thank you
Really good video. The insights on how to get a freelance job can be applied to any industry really. Great work üôåüèª
You're honestly inspiring me to self-study and learn Data Science.
Bazara net ! Very good advice!
Hello sir

My question is, as i am data scientist aspirant and started learning R, python, practising tableau, BI. And i am also interested in learning SQL. should i learn PL/SQL or T/SQL as a data scientist aspirant. How much it is worthy to learn SQL or PL/SQL or T/SQL for me or none of them are required. 

Thanks
Amazing videos Ken! I am happy to find your channel. Keep up good work.
Hey, you got an awesome channel with a lot of valuable videos.
Do you think data science jobs could become non existent in the future with the possibility of it getting automated using tools and having non specialists utilize those tools
Thanks for sharing, Ken. Definitely learned a lot from your story.
Thanks for the video! really interesting video, I'm actually a product guy but love to use all the data available to do my work. Provides me lots of valuable information about product usage, market potential, impact on business and so on. Keep it going!
Ken, I just found your channel, and coming from a software engineering background, I find great value in your data science-related videos. Thanks for your inspiring stories of success!
Thanks for the video
Really love the casual advice he provides through his videos. And really like those random shots of reptiles and üç∫ to make the video more engaging üòÇ‚úåüèºüî•
Hey, how do you calc your usual rate? I heard the rule of thumb is 1% of the annual salary per day. Also, do you think that freelancing in data science is the way to go? I'd prefer to work on a project by project basis rather than being an employee and doing the same every month.
Thanks Ken for sharing your experience in landing the contract job. Really like the background, the aesthetics (lighting + plants) are awesome!
always awaiting ken jees videos!
Sir, Is it beneficial to do Data scientist course with B.Sc in physics or with Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA)?
Ken Jee ~good luck~~üëçüòä
Thanks for sharing your content. Can you share your experience on some real world project? It will be very helpful. Really appreciate your help!
I've been interested in data science consulting for a while now. Developing relationships in business is so important, something you can't learn in a deep learning course.
Thanks a lot! :) Really useful advice for fresh graduates!
so after i graduated in civil eng. i did some worked hated it so had to quit tryna find my self i came across data science its soemthing if i put in effort i can truly be great but i have been studying since 8-9 months i havent achieved the mastery people online tell so its really getting frustating for me because idk maybe i get too overwhelmed from the codes i see and i am like how i dont know this basic code i can understand the methods involved but i dont feel confident enough for a job but i need atleast an intern job or something because i just acnt sit at home seeing my life passing by ,i know its much i had to let it out somewhere 
sharing experience and advice would be helpful
Now you really seem confident in this video! The stock clips were a nice addition as well, I particularly like that you only put them into the video sparingly. It's just incredible how much you and your channel has evolved in such a relatively short period of time! Very inspirational!
Hi Ken, I know it is not related to the video but I got a question, I was planning to start a Data Science club at my high school and what suggestions do you have for projects and stuff like that to do at the club that are friendly for high school students... Thank You Ken!
Hey Ken your doing a fabulous job! Your videos help me a lot. Thank you mate .
I wanted to ask you how do you manage time? Because in this field you gotta put in hours and I'm that kind of guy who like to relax on weekends after a hard week. I mean how do you do it? I mean being on YouTube and learning new everyday and working your job? Can you please share some insights.You also reply try to reply to almost every comments which is one of the reason  I love your channel . Thankyou Ken . Love Dinesh
@ken Thanks for your work and time man, keep posting. All videos are helpful in some or the other way
Got rejected today.W told that the deadline was today so they couldn't put me in the project. They literally gave me the 6 dates to choose and I choose accordingly. Ohh well
Thinkin of leaving academia once I‚Äôm done my PhD (genomics) so thanks for this.
What was your rate that ended up being discounted
Thank you so much !
sir can you make video on types of white board questions that are been asked by data scientists during interview
Thank you ken for sharing this, Can you tell us more about which field you should choose as you have a sports field, or how one can select the particular field or what areas of fields are available ?
Thanks for sharing your story Ken!

Also, where did you get the short clips in between your video? Clips like plants growing, a person writing the word analytics and stuff.
Thanks for sharing @Ken üòä
You‚Äôve quickly become one of my favorite Youtubers! I‚Äôve been learning data science while attending college, and I‚Äôm hoping to become a data scientist after my enlistment in the Air Force!
Hi Ken I love you videos‚ù§Ô∏è Can you please suggest a data science course that provides project and placement too.
Zehahahaha

Wonderful conversation :) Danny showed first as very kind and tender person and then showed as a wise sensei master. This conversation gave me a lot of insights for using social media. Thanks for the content!
Thanks, a lot of insight from this
sir is competitive programming and hackathons necessary for data science
Having a mentor seems like a very cool idea, just having someone you can connect with and learn from while of course making a great new friend. 
I think it can be very difficult to find a mentor, especially if you're starting out or data science is not really as established in your country. I look forward to meeting more awesome people on my way and I am super grateful for everyone I have met so far. 
These longer videos are really in-depth and I quite enjoy that!
Hi Ken... I am looking for mentorship in ml ops side activities like production model deployment pipeline, monitoring, audit, model auto retraining etc... Plz guide pathway or may be can i reach out to Dan...
Hey Ken! is it really important to complete all micro courses like intermediate machine learning and like that is kaggle to do our first project
How long does it take to become data scientist?
Thanks for the video Ken, and Congratulations on your course with 365 , wish you more success, keep up the good work
Wow wonderful video!! I am a data analytics professional trying to set pitch into data science role and working with data science teams within my current organization is what I am trying to do as well. Hope I succeed in that. Thanks for this video üòÉ
This was a great video Ken!
I am switching into data science after 13 years of experience . I was an IT Quality analyst for 8 years but I am not into IT for the past 5 years. I am planning to join full time Masters in Data Science in UK and switch my career. Will this be a good idea? Some universities focus on statistics and deep learning more and some are focusing on computer courses. Which one will be better to choose?
Thanks for sharing! Hearing someone else made it the way I'm trying to get through it really helped me to know I'm on the right path.
What's cool about the data science world is that everyone has different backgrounds and stories. I Really enjoyed the podcast and I'm looking forward to the future ones as well!
Greetings from Brazil, I am migrating to the field and your channel has been helping me a lot !
Gogoogoggo
Special thanks again to Thinam for submitting his work! If you would like to have your projects, resume, or linkedin reviewed in the future, please comment below and email me at kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
Definitely did enjoy the linkedin part
I feel like lots of people are getting I to DS, don't u think same?
It is a kind of buzz word DS
So cool to see me in there haha! Keep up the awesome stuff Ken :)
Hey Ken your videos are superb. I recently worked on a dataset. Could you see it is fine or not??
Love the review.
While starting DS path amd having about 8 months to get first internship should I focus only data analyst things or data engineering skills?
Would you think it would be helpful to put projects we did in University on our GitHub pages? (I'm a new grad)
Key Ken, just sent you an email. Hope I can make it into one of your episodes!
If someone is introverted then what is your optimum requirement.
Like you said in linkedin profile they don't wanna share everything so what's your take on this.
This was very helpful! Please keep them coming Ken.
Ken Jee on laptop in background is meta.
I am in a serious dilemma , should one go striaght for Deep learning or practise machine learning ? 
Thnx for the help.
And love ur videos
It's been few months now that I've been watching your videos. It goes undenied that they are really insightful. 
I'd like you to give a read to my article on medium about one of the topic you talked about 'ULTRALEARNING' 
I've mentioned the link - https://medium.com/@jairajc9/ultralearning-fe8a1f4cc349
I'd like to have your feed back on the same. 
Thank you!
I was not confident about my Git, I would love to watch some tutorial in showcase current project or any upcoming project
Thanks Ken for another awesome resume review! Nice GitHub portfolio, projects were quite unique and shows a great level of creativity, kudos to Thinam!
Loved the overall review!
Ken  Jeeüëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëè
Great video as usual,Thanks
Sir, I have completed micro course you suggested on kaggle, but I don't know how to do projects and how to select them. Please help me with that
Great Video Mr. ken.
What editor do you use? Microsoft visual studio code?
Hi Ken. I have a problem in Kaggle I don¬¥t know if you can help me. Since the training set has all features and test set has all except the predicting one, I cant predict y for the test set because is not the same shape that the train set (that i use to fit). How can I solve it?
Hello,First of all thanks for all your great videos...
I want your help regarding my ML path..
   I have been learning ML for almost 4 months.I have done few courses on udemy and coursera,but still if I follow some professional's repository,or if I open the libraries codes for debugging I cannot understand alot of python stuff.,like how the functions are written and other advanced stuff.
  So if you can suggest me some specific python  course that can make me comfortable with all these things.
  I am currently doing ML engineering nanodegree from udacity,but that is also too costly..
  Thanks.. regards
Hey, Ken. You make a great job, thank you!
Hi Ken, This was such a great video, I really enjoy your videos. I have a question, I am grade 11 student and I am an aspiring data scientist, I have been doing lots of research about the field and I started taking free courses online, I want to know what you will suggest me to study in my undergraduate to become a successful data scientist. Thank you, and Keep up the work!
Big fan of more LinkedIn reviews in the future! Danny is always posting great stuff!
It's great that you have included LinkedIn in your reviews. Although I am a beginner in Data Science and whole Analytics thing but still I would like my GitHub and LinkedIn to be reviewed.
Great reviews as always :D
Personally I struggle the most on optimizing my LinkedIn-profile so it is definitely interesting to see good examples
(would love to see more!).
Oh and btw: Your new environment (with the monitor and the flower) looks *really* nice.
Also, I know its not your niche to talk about news but I'm curious about what you're thoughts on GPT3 is
Hey Ken, what are your thoughts about having a 2-page resume? (called CV's in places like the UK where I am)
Entry level Data scientist : Don't manage their time well .
Pro Data scientists : Buy 4  clocks  üòÇ
Great video as always dude. Can I ask what monitor you use for doing work? Been thinking about saving for an UltraWide :)
Hey Ken, I have a question. When one makes a project for a company they work in, using the company's confidential data, etc. How does one publishes it or add it to their portfolio? Should one change the data? Like, names and labels? Or one should just not publish any project related to confidential data of any company, and just make projects using open source data?
Hi Ken. I would love to eventually become a data scientist, but I don't know if I am smart enough. In your opinion, do you need to be far above average intelligence to be a data scientist? Or would you say its doable with average (or slightly above) intelligence and a strong sense of curiosity, willingness to learn, persistence, etc.?
We do lot of projects as a biostatistics student like regression trees and random forests can I put these class projects in github too? Or  should I just focus on posting projects outside classes?
please do more of these.
This is so helpful Ken, thanks a lot
Sir which MacBook should I buy for data science learning in budget
I've been preparing my github, website and LinkedIn to finally get the confidence to ask to get a review üòÇ
Ken jee...thats a good review to make us understand what should we do n dont...Thanks for interesting video
Its great you added LinkedIn now I think I would share mine too ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
KEN I LOVE your work. im like on my new data science journey , doing a 3 month bootcamp with  General assembly in Data science. What would be the order of your videos like a newbie like me should pay attention to.
I'm interested
Thank you Ken,
I really appreciate your time and effort üòä
üíØüéØ
Great stuff! Thanks! Can you make a video discussing tableau, Apache Superset or similar type soft considering their application, importance ? Really appreciate your hard work!
Thinum Tamang :)  Hey
i'm interested  :)
Thanks for watching everyone! Remember to comment below with your name for my new computer ! The best name will win a Jetson Nano!

I am suggesting name very late but if you ask me my suggestion will be TiZen

Really powerful machine.... üî•Your projects will be very HAPPY with you Ken  üòÇ
Hi Ken, thank you for a great video. I am also building a PC GPU first :) and this video is so relatable. 
I was wondering if the CPU is a bottle neck ?
What is the rating of the power supply you are using?
Did you add any extra cooling?
What is the model number of your cabinet?
If you can shed some light on these it will really ease my decision making. Thank you.
Hyperion ! a TITAN and bigger than super!!!!!
How about "super saiyan"
titan rtx now beaten by rtx 3080 for half the price lmfao you got ripped bro
Name it 'Model Overfit' :)
because with this power it's very tempting to make a mistake and overfit the model)
Beast gig, I am new to deep learning. Please let me know if my below pc is ok for it

Processor- AMD Phenom hi x6 (6 core 6 threads)

Ram - 16 gb ddr3 1800

Graphic card - ati 5770 1 gb ddr5 

240 gb SSD 

1 tb hard disk
Tigeragon will be a good name!
Hyperion like the titan in ancient greek mitology
Super cool to see that you also build computers. About you breaking your side panel, the funny thing is the same thing happened to my friend about a month ago who ordered that same lian li mid-tower case. He wasnt sure where he could purchase another panel separetely so he purchased another new case entirely. After watching him gently  placing the side panel down on the floor to remove the film it shattered again lol. I also just upgraded very recently and made sure not to purchase that one and went with the nzxt. Anyways, just had to share this and let you know that you aren't an outlier.
Goldmember! You built this rig around that beautiful gold Titan card, so I think the name should reflect that. Also, one of the all-time great Bond films üëåüèΩ
Ryz-Cruncher just for its sheer performance and number crunching potential.
Name it KAIJU
"Professor" like from money heist, because its seemingly calm with the lovely white exterior and nice lighting, but in reality nothing is stopping its constantly fierce compute, power and GENIUS!

Loved the video - what a beautiful machine!
My name suggestion is Monarch.
How about BlackDeath ü§îü§îü§î
After a famous chess player Henry Blackburne
I see all these creative names in the comments , while my 2 awake brain cells  thought " Thor" üòÇ , this video was so much fun !
DEITY - a god cos that's what you are building üòÖ
Tesoro, italian for treasure, because that pc is gold!
Stormbreaker
I would suggest Black Mamba just for 1 reason and that is Kobe Bryant. I am a huge basketball fan. I know that you are into Sports Analytics so that will be the perfect name. üëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è
DeepBeest
I just read Circe, a book about the daughter of Helios, the titan god of the sun. He was a jerk (as were all the gods in the story), but Circe was pretty awesome. She was clever, devious and a problem solver. I think Circe would be a good name.
‚ÄúPrometheus‚Äù the Ryzen Titan.  Have no idea what the kit is for but I just started taking data science classes so it‚Äôd be some super delayed gratification üòÇ
Not exactly cost efficient way of doing things.
Should be called El Tigre for sure.
Zeus
What are the temperature cpu package for this build idle and at full load
A video on how to respond when one of your projects doesn't go to plan would be great! Do you just forget it ever happened? Or do you put it on your CV anyway, even though you didn't get any inspiring results?
how  about  'deepmonster'?
sir which is best for data visualization Python or Tableau
Just finished watching the video and taught of a budget and when I saw the price of TITAN RTX, its price was 3 to 4 times more. And then taught its okay I will use my 4gb ram and 1gb graphics card for deep learning, hope so one day gotta build PC like this expensive.
A new day and now let's see video what to do when you model takes moths to train ........ Kidding

Name ---> Bok --Beast of Ken --> Bok
Since you live in Chicago, I would go with ‚ÄúMonster of the Midway.‚Äù
finally, I found someone interset to config and Deep learning, thank you so much.
how about OS? (Windows or Linux which better?)
Where can i get the wallpaper
Hi Ken, I enjoy your videos, thanks for helping me on my data scientist journey. Name your PC "Kobe" after the late great, Kobe Bryant.
The thumbnail is scary indeed ü§™
As for someone not too keen on computer science and still learning recently, how viable is data science as a career for someone like me. Remember, still pretty new to the idea not computer science it self. My freshman year my courses revolve around more of an actuary field, macro,/micro, calc 3, stats, and intro to comp sci. I plan to transfer out next yr hopefully, and if I get into one of my choices, my major will most likely be operations research/ financial Engineering/computational finance. What would be guidance / word of advice for someone like me if I did pursue a more data science track instead for a career
THIS MAN IS LIVING HIS BEST LIFE.
BinFin for binary finery is my suggestion for your rig's name. What OS or OSes are you going to use?
Hey Ken!!Just love your content dude. I am 19.I just wanted you to ask How to keep consistency? I love this field and currently learning python. I like it. But it gets intimidating there is so much more to learn and know. How do I keep going? I know it's a long journey. How did you keep the patience and consistency?
Ken, name it Ashwathama. Its a hindu mythological god. Its a man as well an elephant. So both characteristics of man and beast. Good luck
samaritan
Hey Ken! This was a fun video. I‚Äôd say you name it ‚ÄúStormbreaker‚Äù since your last computer was named after Thor‚Äôs hammer!
Call it "TITANIC"
It should be called " CPU ", and let the viewer be surprised. 

Ken : Turn on CPU
Frn : ok!! 
Frn : woaahhhhhhhh!!!!
you should name it Yeager. It's from Attack on Titan anime
I think you should name this beast --"TANZEN"!
cheers!!
Anton
Call it Saturn V, after the rocket that was used in the Apollo missions. Without such a powerful vehicle that was so well crafted, humanity wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get to the Moon and make that ‚Äúgreat step‚Äù. I feel that this computer could mean something similar to you, in terms of hardware :)
Datsmon or DTSJee or DataJee
You should call it "Shredder" because it will shred the data!
GKen as 1. There's your name 2. Acronym for Global Knowledge Exchange Network
Maajin !!! Buuu :)
I think "Storm breaker" as it will coincide with your previous build,  and will also justify with that white-colored chassis.
By the your workstation looks amazing, looking forward to more projects on it. Best wishes
Amazing workstation and NVIDIA really got stuff to work on.  I will suggest the name "Predator" or as you are sports analytics I will suggest "Jordan Beast" or " Bolt"
mjolnir, nice, i like that hammer a lot, its like there is life in it. since this is a upgrade to new, faster and stronger PC, name it stormbreaker, haha..., or DataSmasher etc
How about "Nix" simple yet edgy?
"Zamasu" from the Dragon ball super seriesüî•
Cool
"Enzo" because that thing is as fast as a Ferrari
name it Jee Jee
Name it ODIN
The Shredder or The Reaper will be the perfect name ü•∫
Haha I was expecting a Henry Cavill build video lol.  Also is that a Cotopaxi sweater!  Great video.  If you're a portal 2 fan you can call it GLaDOS
Well, Hela destroyed Mjolnir and Surtur overpowered Hela aaand he is kind of a beast... SURTUR!!
You can name it Thanos, it will erase  training time in half.
Call it Roberto
You should just name it Uchiha Madara then
Awesome!!!

Name it: Leviathan Behemoth!!!
Nicklaus at Night
Kronos or zeus
Stormbreaker
Snow White would be a cool name
Well *this* is what I call an original intro :D
This really made me excited to watch the rest of the video! 
And as for the name:
Since you already went the for the nordic route, 
how about the name ''Valkyrie''? 
I think it would be a great follow-up to Mj√∂lnir! :D
Man you gotta shoot in higher FPS! Maybe 60 or 120 frames per second and your slow-motion will look way smoother, cleaner, and cinematic. Check out Mark Bone's channel- he has a video called "WHY 120fps IS OVERUSED. FRAME RATE GUIDE: 60/120/180fps". (The beginning of the video the slow motion looked unnatural)
Oisin Brannock. Love your videos Ken I‚Äôve never seen anyone who both shares my passion of golf and data science keep it up dude
Balls Deep
My little war machine lmao (love that meme
Moana, bc you are from Hawaii lol jk
How about " PERCEPTRON " üî•
dude you're gonna be playing cyberpunk 2077 on ultra high in 8k and 200 fps on that machine. that's crazy!
Name it "DataSlayer" lol
Leo. That last part of the video though xD.
My suggestion "Lena"
Hopper or Jeevice (Invented from JarviceTexas Supercomputer))
Hope you like it üñ§üíå
You can easily overclock that RAM in case you need extra power :)
LOL The VERGE call out.
Frost Titan might be a cool name
Hulk
if u like pokemon, u can name as 'Raikou' its one of the most powerful pokemon which has amazing electric power :) ur gpu remind me of raikou haha
Hands down my favorite video of yours!
hey @Ken Jee  call it Rocketrain ..........your models will be training at rocket speed now........hehehe
Beast is hereü§ë
Ken Jeeüëçüëçüëç
Call it Beast of the Depths
I would name it Honey Badger,  the most badass creature with no natural predators
Name it as VIVAN means intelligent
The name should be RT-Rex, to beat the dinosaure game when your internet crashes !
Hey bro ... i will name this pc as "susanoo"  from Naruto reference - since susanoo fights on your behalf.

I also would like to know if we do a sli of 1080 or 2080 will the performance be greater or a single powerful card is ok for deep learning. Currently i dont need this much power but its for the future
#TAIJEE or #TIJEE
Holy crap! What a beast! I might get some of your parts when building my own PC.

Explanation of the name: got the name from the martial art "tai chi" and I mixed it with Titan (the GPU), Tiger (one of the beast animals), and your last name Jee lol.
Nice video Ken- sweet build damn that Titan is clean.
GhostCat 
Anyway, your build is super awesome :D
Thanks for another great video Ken! It was really fun to watch this video! I would like to suggest the name "TIZEN"  (TI from TITAN and ZEN from RYZEN) that can also be called "TIZEN the Beast". Inspired from the name of Mike Tyson and his nickname "The Beast". üòÉ
Its white and its a beast = Fenrir (a white wolf) ! Also just wondering, regarding the choice of CPU. Doesn't ryzen cpu's have problem with intel compilers which significantly reduces performance?
Sycamore


Using the company's state-of-the-art quantum computer, called Sycamore, Google has claimed "quantum supremacy" over the most powerful supercomputers in the world by solving a problem considered virtually impossible for normal machines.
You are a good hardware engineer
I would recommend Zenitsu as name.
How about 'Everest'? New heights and all that jazz
Computer name : Katy ,  reminds me of Roar - by Katy Perry . Nice PC btw.
Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this.
As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because -
1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool
2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time
3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense

Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!
PS: I hope you like my name and the reasoning I gave
Maybe name it Imperiex, It's a DC Vilan.
It's name should be BeastoComputa
Can I learn deep learning on Macbook Pro
Call it JARVIS
Name it Fugaku
Name- Samurai
Call it Haietlik. 
It's a mythological creature, "Lightning Serpent". They are described as huge serpents with heads as sharp as a knife and tongues that shoot lightning bolts. (From Wikipedia)
You know... Cause Python
Maybe name it Cronus, one of the Titans from Greek mythology, since the center of the build is the Titan RTX
nice devbox)
Name it THE KITTEN. It purrs like a one.
What an awesome workstation! Hope I could get one üòÅ I am also a big fan of AMD and never get disappointed by its performance, durability, and obviously the price.
The name I suggest is "Saturn" since Titan is Saturn's largest moon
Since you are calling it a beast what better then the 'Kraken' itself
Name it JEEzus
"Po" should be the name ....
From kung fu panda. Because of it's black & white look and it's a panda and a beast...you know right panda..pandas....right...
How about X √Ü A-12 üòú
Cheetah
Drago
call it  {    Mark ||   }
Harpe or Cronus. Cronus was one of the 12 Titans of Greek mythology, and the Harpe was his weapon fashioned by Gaia.
Wolverine
Call it < Dr. Zola >
How about Bruce?
The computer name has to be Benetton ..
you should name it "Better than the verge build"
Call the PC Masamune!
DataWeaver or Zeus - one of the most powerful gods (greek myth)
Name: The JEENATION
Treat your as your buddy.. and name it.. Scooby Doo!!! Or Guntherüî•üî•üòÇüòÇ
Thanks for watching everyone! Remember to comment below with your name for my new computer ! The best name will win a Jetson Nano!
NVIDIA TITAN RTX Details: https://nvda.ws/32ViJVx
Awesome work station!
Damn that's a beast.... and the verge is now a level of very bad in PC building community xD
You should name this new computer Stormbreaker! That or Gungnir. I like the Norse Mythology inspired naming theme you had for your first one :) 

Edit: Or if you're looking for something else, Godzilla could be a cool name? Final answer though is Stormbreaker.
Keeping with the same theme, StormBreaker...PC name
Thanks for watching everyone! You can learn more about Eric on his linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-weber-060397b7/
I am Indian. how can I apply for data science job in foreign country if I am fresher b.tech 2020 batch.
Eric is great! Love his LinkedIn posts! Great video Ken.
Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. 
     As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. 
     Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward. Imagine if we all share, the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn, get inspired and create further awesome data science work. üòÉ
Sir, I have a confusion
I want to ask which is better an online certification course on data science or a 3 year degree program?
Just a Quick question: 
Should I (I'm from non-technical background) be doing competitive programming and algos in Hackerrank or Github to learn and excel in Data science?

Thanks, your videos are very helpful.
I recently read something about digital footprints (don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8yXWFRROg&t=479s). It talked about how anything you do or post online, maybe a github account, or a comment on stackoverflow, anything that can help the world see you, is efficient, the important thing is to do somehting.  Sooner or later, opportunities will come.

Great video Ken. A suggestion: I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners  trying to enter the data science market (in your case in the U.S.). How it's possible, advices, maybe stereotypes or if there is much prejudice. Think it's a nice subject.
üëèüëèüëèüî•Great content like always. üî•
David Perell wrote about the concept of 'serendipity vehicle' in one of his blog posts where he explains the importance of sharing your work on the internet. It goes hand-in-hand with what you explained.  
Great video!
This video hit really deep personally.
I have been thinking for a few months now that I should
show my work more. I though about starting a YouTube-channel or a blog,
because I think it would be a lot of fun doing so.
Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand,
and your choice is not if you want one or not,
but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not,
this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work.
I now feel even more motivated to start sharing my work more.
Thank you for this video!
Sharing your work -> opens up more opportunities
Hello Ken! It's amazing how your channel has been growing. I'm looking forward to expand my DS knowledge. Are there any books/text books you would recommend for learning Data Science? Thanks!
Can you please tell,from where should i study mathematics for data science?
Video just shows you don't need to have great hair to be a data scientist! Thanks for watching everyone! Comment below if you would like me review your project, portfolio, or resume. Please also send an email to kenjee.ds@gmail.com
Love your resume reviews!
Hey Ken can you please review my resume for Applied Scientist / Computer Vision R & D positions? I have emailed you my latest resume to the specified email id. Thanks for your uploads.
Any good resume templates I can use?
Can you make a video on writing "Statement of Purpose" for a masters degree in Data Science?
hey ken from where can i download these resumes ?
Do you think is better to put the kaggle classifications in a project or something like the value for accuracy o rmse reached in the model? I have some projects and some nice classifications in kaggle as well. 
Thank you for your  job
Hey  ken jee, great video. 
I recently got a data science certification and going to apply for junior data scientist job (I have in me almost all skills company required) no job experience in data science field, that's why I am confuse how to make resume as a beginner? 

Kindly suggest me, or make a video on that.
hey ken, where to edit or create resumes , tell  me some good sources
This is so helpful, thank you!
hi ken, I have sent you my CV please review it and thank you for teaching and guiding us. You are my role model and inspiring all of us to be driven in the world of Data Science. Thankyou
Thank you for  your content ken! I hope to be a data scientist one day, and your videos are inspiring!
can you send the pdfs?
evilc3.github.io just created yesterday
For someone like me who has been working for different domains (HR Analytics & Business Analytics), What do you think will be a good idea, to create a mixed resume or have them separate.
My personal inclination is People's Analytics (HR side) but I don't see enough job openings here in India.
Your Guidance is appreciated.
Hi Ken, Love your work and it really helps me a lot!! I hope you can review my resume and give me some insight!! Thank you
I just sent an email. I hope you pick mine for one of the coming videos
Hey Ken, Currently I'm learning Data Science, but soon I want to learn Deep Learning and Machine Learning too, Which one should I go to first. And what should be the areas I should cover in those, I'm totally unaware of these topics. Thank You. Great content! :))
Hi Ken I would love if you review my resume, I just sent you one in email.
Hey Ken,
thank you so much for the great videos!
Would you rather suggest to improve Python skills (after some first projects) or change the main focus on other recommended languages like SQL?
Thanks Ken! Which resume template would you recommend?
Do you have any tips for high schoolers interested in data science?
Hey Ken, great video as usual. I wanted to let you know that I got the job in downtown Chicago at a finance company but I have some questions. I start in 2 weeks and in that time I want to do some finance projects but kaggle doesn‚Äôt have that many, I was wondering if you could recommend some finance projects/datasets that I could practice on. Thank you!
This series really is giving me such a confident boost with the provided tips that I'm learning!
Heyyy ken jee,
You, data professor, krish naik and codebasics are doing an excellent work and helping many data aspirants from the world to get their life settle. Thank you for all of thisüòÄ.
Thanks for taking the time to review my resume! I hope that you continue on giving insightful advice to help more people get into this industry üôÇ
What's the exact difference between a Machine Learning Engineering vs Data Scientist?
Long time no comment (exam period came quick :D) !
Awesome review(s)! I just took some time to catch up on your uploads and I noticed,
that your recording, your background and your thumbnails have upgraded! 
It was also really great seeing you collaborate with other people in the community.
One question I always had about your channel is why you had this golf-wallpaper as your channel banner.
But after watching the previous videos I learned why, which was cool to know :D
Hey, Would you mind making a video on data science resumes for freshers who are seeking for either an internship or a full time job?
üíØüí™
Another great video Ken! Awesome insights on crafting the perfect resume. üëç
Sir I want you to also review data science internship Resumes too
I'm doing a virsual internship that data professor mentioned, in which section should I put it my resume?
Thanks so much.!!!.....ur videos have helped me very much for my data science career.
Cool
Thank you master bruno Mars! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Heyy first here 
After your last video I started working with Titanic data would love to share it with you and would like to know your opinion once I am done with it
Thanks for watching! Feel free to upvote the kaggle notebook if you found it helpful! 
Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/titanic-project-example
My Kaggle Profile: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee
Try watching my kaggle project from scratch series next! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-DR9HBaipU&ab_channel=KenJee
As a complete beginner, can anyone tell which topics should I learn before trying these types of competition.. anyone?
The letters in the cabin correspond to the deck.
Kaggle is the creepiest organisation that has ever existed. In order to verify you for competitions with prize money they want a 3D model of your head!!! Wow! 

Let me repeat in case you think you miss read what I typed

KAGGLE WANTS a 3D MODEL OF YOUR HEAD!!!!

What are they doing with all those heads?!????? An AI company that harvests human heads!!!
Thanks! It was insightful and too the point. A lecturer pointed to this website. I'm just starting off but haven't put my learnings together such as this video shows. Now I'm aware I have more self teaching to do
thanks for this video. Just started this problem and realized I have no idea what I'm doing
Aren't some fields "redundant"? I mean, female with one spouse is almost automatically a "Mrs." and I don't know whether that leads to a bias or not. Thank you
I took several days and went through this.  It was a good starting point.  You simply can't learn it all in a few days.  As Ken said, this is to be used as a framework.  Learning the various models and the revaluations are extremely important
Thanks for your great tutorial on youtube! I have a question In regrading to this analysis. In 24:40 you start talking about cross validation. I'm not sure If I clear understand your code here. You're making cross validation on X_train /y_train data set? Is this correct aproach? Or we should do this on whole data set X/y?
very good!
so much emphasis on the model, not enough on the data..
I scored 0.69 in my first kaggle competition ü•π
Good to know, in a sinking ship, you have more chances of survival if you're rich or a woman, or a rich woman is even better perhaps. Damn, seeing as I am a poor man, I'm never going to travel by ship. EVER ü§£
Actually Capt is not for the captain of the ship it seems , after some internet search i found out that Capt is referred to a different captain that was onboard the titanic as a passenger who unfortunatly lost his life in the sinking.
can someone pls explain what is the meaning of len(x.split(' '))......in cabin column?
Great video! Iwas super clueless before this video but after watching it i became much less clueless but also found out that i was even more clueless haha! I just moved over from c to python and see a lot of not so familiar python code(i only have the basicsüò≠). Can you tell me what parts of python i had to go through to start with? Thanks again for the video!
Wow this is a gold mine! Can't believe you went through all that work! Looking through all this, it seems like to become a great data scientist, it's not just about the skill. It is about intelligence and your ability to understand and see things that aren't clear to the normal human being. I have a fairly normal IQ and i am currently wondering if i should continue building my skills in order to become a data scientist.
I will try this very soon. Bookmarking this
Bless me for my success üî•üáÆüá≥üôè
I am trying to understand the one-hot encoder method you suggested around 22:03, applying this method to real-world datasets. I ran into this issue before and had to merge train and test data sets to be able to apply a one-hot encoder. What is the solution to the issue of not having the same columns when we apply a one-hot encoder to train and test sets separately? I don't know how to approach that.
there too many "ACTUALLY" in the video lol. its totally fine tho
‚ù§
What an in-depth analysis!  
By the way,  how many possible approaches are there to this dataset?
I am new in the field of data science in terms of experience. I have completed paid skill course from IBM though. In my first attempt of this project which is my first project i got an accuracy of 78%. Is it good enough and should i move on to next project or try to refine my model for better accuracy. Please suggest someone with experience
Thanks for the great efforts
Anyone is know the same projects like this Titanic by the difficulty?
I need project easy as this Titanic))
Hi Ken, I want to say thank you for this wonderful explanation and this break down of what a data science project workflow typically looks like. Amazing job!!
Just one question when you use pd.get_dummies shouldn't you set drop_first parameter to true that way you use one less column and not worry about multicollinearity in the new columns generated
I'm here because of GPT4. Before GPT4 was released, I had a decent basic understaning of data science applications, but did not have the time to learn all of the Python syntax. Now, with GPT4, all I have to do it understand how to explain what i want to do, and GPT4 takes care of all the coding. It wouldn't be hard to create this entire notebook in 2-3 hours of time. 

Wild times we live in!
why am I not getting anything what he says. I am still taking the Google Data Analytics course and I have some knowledge of SQL are they not enough for me to understand what he says ?
Thank you for the content!
I copied the code below from you, but it didn't work for me. I wonder why?

for i in df_cat.columns:
    sns.barplot(df_cat[i].value_counts().index, df_cat[i].value_counts()).set_title(i)
    plt.show()

hi, thanks for this explanation I have a question is this dataset suitable for semantic annotation and event extraction?
U did feature Engineering first?? Then remove outliers ü§î
Strange. I thought the answer was, 'women and children in first class'. That's what I got and some other people.
you are a genius!!!!
I learned so much from your video, thank you!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9zVmz9afR7wIfE_xLPbwCg
I am taking the test, but it sounds impossible to pass ! Any idea to the test
I'm very very very soooooo much
Thanks, Ken for this great video. Can you please explain, how did you measure that the Model XGboost is overfitting?
The music in the background is very distracting. I keep looking around for the noise.
Thanks for the video! I have some DS experience but it was very helpful to see how an expert would approach a Kaggle problem.
im a beginner at this and have a question: where is the actual tuning going on? i.e. how do you "improve" your score? because anyone can just run these ML models on the data, so is it in the preprocessing steps
I'd like to say that I discovered a gem of a channel today.
Hi Ken, thank you so much for the video! It's super helpful! One quick question: when creating dummies for categorical variables, did you also create dummies for variable 'norm_fare'? Based on my understanding, 'norm_fare' is a continues variable, but it is included in the list of variables which we were trying to get dummies from (all_dummies = pd.get_dummies(all_data[['Pclass','Sex','Age','SibSp','Parch','norm_fare','Embarked','cabin_adv','cabin_multiple','numeric_ticket','name_title','train_test']])).
Great video Ken!! I am a begineer in Data Science. Can you please explain the reason for creating dummy variables? And why is numeric_ticket included in the training and testing sets?
As a beginner this was a bit to complex for me, wished if you may have made it a bit more structured and simple
I keep getting tired and demotivated and I keep picking myself up to learn this :(
Very helpful
can you pls do more kaggle projects pls üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
Hi Ken, Thank you very much for this video. I am getting an error at section 11 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AttributeError: 'Index' object has no attribute 'df_cat' I have put in df_cat in section 7 like you did. I don't know what I am doing wrong. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks
Thank you for this video!  On a separate note, how do you get your plots to be so colorful?
fantastic video, my friend. I started this project in R studio, ran into some walls, and got extremely frustrated. Listening to your process is extremely helpful. Thanks for the upload.
Thanks so much, i feel happy that i could undersrand 90% of the content months ago i didnt knew a thing!
Hello, Ken, I wanna know about if there are many files in the data set in kaggle competition, how can I use Jupyter or colab to do code. Thanks a bunch.
very helpful, thank you. comment for the algorithm.
Hello Ken, was it R you used in this analysis ?
Thanks a lot for this video, having learning a lot of things and didn't know how to tie all the ropes together. This video was for it. Thanks a lot Ken Jee :)
13:27 why exactly do you choose 'Ticket' for values in the pivot-table? Dont understand that
Hello, beginner data scientist. Great video! I'm trying this out and my pivot table outputs don't have scrollbars. What could be the reason? I would want to view all the columns via the pivot table. 

I'm using Kaggle. 

Thanks.
Ken, I Think about the project planning which on Histogram and Boxplot should be place after missing data,
So Here's the plan order from the top
- understand the Type of data 
- value counts
- missing data
- histogram and boxplot
Then continue by following step you make from
- correlarion analysis 
- exploring interesting fact
Until scaling
Huge thanks from beginner DS switching from mechanical engineering!
Hey Ken! I know this is an old video, but I was watching this again to plan a project that I am planning to work on. At the exploratory analysis part, you say that age looks like it is normally distributed. However, I'm pretty sure that if we run a Shapiro-Wilk test on it, it will turn out to be non-normal. So, I am wondering what do you mean by 'looks normally distributed' here? Are you looking for extremely skewed distributions to normalize? Thanks! Go #66daysofdata =)
Could u please tell how did you change color to black of "Out"s ?
Ken, I'm a long time listener first time caller :) This is a terrific video .. and I have one question!  

... at around 22:00 you clearly tell us that concatenating training and test datasets together and then pre-processing them all together is NOT the way it should be done in real -world (real world way, as I understood: train encoder scaler on training dataset then transform test dataset using encoder scaler trained (only) from training dataset). 

So .. do you have (or do you know of one) similar to this one but which demos the real world way of doing business?
Hey Ken! I am copying this project to understand the process. I am confused about the explanation you give on using all_data vs training & test data separately. Can you explain why training and test sets should be processed separately by giving a bit more background? Thanks!
Great work!  I was just wondering why you would create dummy variables for features like "Age", "SibSp", "Parch". These features are either float or int. They are continuous and not categories/strings like name_title.
Hi Ken, any reason for calling fit() method twice on rf? I mean best_estimator is used already. It is not the case with xgb..
Thanks a lot!
I'm just beginning with Data Science. I 'don't understand, why you transform "norm_Fare" to a Dummy-Variable with 0/1?
Great video! Do you perhaps know whether should beginner in ML have good knowledge of statistics to even start learning it, and advanced knowledge of calculus and linear algebra?
Thanks for sharing. From start to finish to this video, how many hours did you work on? I just want to benchmark myself accordingly.
thanks Ken this was really helpful
Thank you for this great video! I've already subscribed to your channel, digging to find a lots of DS insights )) 
But please improve the audio quality in future videos: background noises are really frustrating, and a background music seems to be a little bit loud. 
But again, you're making a great resource that is very useful for Data Science beginners like me!
Hi Ken Jee, thanks a lot for the video! Can you please share on Feature Engineering on Cabin? What does the number 0-4 indicates? I don't get that part. Thank you!!
I have a question. in the preprocessing stage you use test set along with training set and you said you do it because in this case we want to know about the test set, but I don't know why. aren't we supposed to predict the output of test set? why do we need to have some information about it in our prediction model then? isn't data leakage happening here?
thank you sir to make this video I can't explain it in words.
how much information in this video. which is really helpful for me to become a good data scientist. thank you so much
Hey ken I have a question I‚Äôve spoken to you before , back when I was getting started with the google data analytics certificate I‚Äôm done with the program now and I noticed they didn‚Äôt teach us how to create models and test sets and stuff ‚Ä¶ what would you suggest I do next ? I‚Äôm guessing machine learning is an important aspect of being a data analyst .. should I take a course on that and get that out of the way ?
Thank you Ken,
just now I finished one course that focused on Titanic survival, your attitude makes more sense for me.
Hi Ken! Thank you for this and all other videos. That's very generous of you. Very valuable information.
My company is suscribed to Coursera and I was wondering which opinion you have of their Data Science courses. I have seen many of your videos, but I think you haven't named it. Is it because cost, quality?
I know this is random question, but to make sure I'm understanding the data, at 14:59 does the last row mean that 2 people had 5 cabins?
woo!
How long does analysis and mode building like this take?
Is this a binary logit model?
9:44
Hello,

I ran this code and received no output:
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory
import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
for filename in filenames:
print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))



Also, I received a FileNotFoundError after running the second line of code:

train_data = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv")
train_data.head()

I downloaded the necessary csv files to a folder on my desktop



I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to proceed further.
this level of coding is scaring me
Hey Ken Jee, thank you for the video, it's helping me a lot. :) I wanted  to ask though, how did you know that you overfitted (the spoiler alert) with XGBoost?
Very cool! By the way, you wrote "compention", instead of "competition" in your notebook's opening remarks <3
You did a great job explaining your approach to solving the task at hand and walking us through the process and so Im wanting to know what would be the next steps for someone wanting to use this competition to learn data science?  Like I dont have a detailed understanding of all  the algorithms that you used in this competition so  would it be best to pick the one that produced the best score and learn how to tune that particular algorithm model metrics to get a better score or would it be best to transfer your process to another beginner competition altogether to create a better understanding of the complete data science process as a whole?
Would you consider doing one for the linear regression example you suggested on your 3 beginners‚Äô projects? It‚Äôs the Aimes housing prices project
Really awesome! My only minor criticism is that in the first half of the video, most of the pivot tables and charts are displaying counts. When comparing counts between categories (i.e. survival rate by age) it really needs to display the percentage of that grouping... Sadly I'm too much of a noob to figure it out just yet :(
Thanks Ken. I loved the video! Do you have any videos that deal in more detail with the correlation heat map output in line 9? I would love to know more about what I can learn from this and when to use it.
hi ken jee! one question for you! about the dummy variables! for example there are 3 categories, so 3 dummy variables would be created for that column, then do we need to remove one dummy variable, because the 3 dummy variables would be linearly dependent with each other?
Thank you for this video and your explanation how you approach data science problems. I was just able to reach the baseline from the Titanic tutorial by my own approach with XGB and GridsearchCV.

Did you tried stacked denoising autoencoder in your projects and how did it work out? It is kinda like an automatic unsupervised learning approach that can be fed into a neural network.

Your channel is golden! Keep it up and stay healthy!
I didn't understand almost 50% of the walkthrough,  got after EDA ‚òπ‚òπüò´.
This walkthrough seems to be a bit too advanced.üò≤
I have a question @24:15 after you made some changes for the entire dataset you split the data to train and test so doesn't this cause data leakage?
Thank you Ken Jee for your video. I have a question maybe you could help me with. Why did you assume/make the variables age and fair price as categorical instead of continous?
Hi Ken, 

Thanks so much for your videos; I find them really encouraging and instructive.

I am wondering, how does the intuition we build about the data inform how we set up the models?
If feels like there was a bit of a disconnect there, and right now if feels like I just turn on these black box
models and get a prediction with little understanding of the variables ...

Thanks!
You should provide timestamps for such big video.
overall great tutorial but fast.
Great! Very inspiring and helpful!
Just came here to see what you got. I used random forest and got .76 on my first try and then a little tuning got it to .77. I think I could make it better so I will continue to play around. I got to the point in my course curriculum mid-lecture I said "this is more advanced than I need to get started on beginner projects" and instantly hopped off to do titanic. I had it all worked up in my head to be some super hard task but it turned out to be relatively painless! I am going to do a couple other smaller projects and then try something of my own, probably using youtube data because I am a massive geek for the algorithim.
You are my absolute Guide to data science. THANKYOU KEN
Thanks Ken Lee, great video. Question: i am working on a different dataset with not many features (ca 12-15). it is an imlabanced dataset with not a lot of '1' but loads of '0'. I am using TomekLinks to balance it out a bit. My highest F1 score is 5%, and whatever i do i cannot make it any higher than that. Do you think this is an example of a project where I will not be able to build a decent model?
Since the test set has no output (Survival), should we even consider it in our EDA? Why not doing just on top of the training set?
What keyboard do you use?
sir can you tell your background music?
Awesome tutorial. I have a question. Why do you log normalize Sibsp and Fare in addition to using StandardScaler? What does the log normalization accomplish that the StandardScaler doesn't?
This video is gold!
Super informative, thanks Ken!
Amazing video. I got a question, don't we need to detect the outlier data in the models? or its not a necessary step in calcification?
Hi Ken, Great Video.
I have a doubt though, when you say you are creating categories based on the first letter of the cabin why are you ignoring the second letter (some have different lettered cabin as the second cabin). eg -> F E69
34:18 Ken, what does the parameter initialization of weight mean. can you explain
Thank you so much for your videos, I watch them all the time.  I'm in a masters DS program, and I feel like I'm actually on the titanic right now, going down down down.  Here you are handing me a raft, a dingy, and also giving me a map to a huge lush closeby island where there's an escape airport.
Hi Ken, Great video. thanks .sorry for a very basic question but how did you get the baseline numbers? I am trying to get them but unable to do so i.e. Naive Bayes (72.6%),Logistic Regression (82.1%), Decision Tree (77.6%) etc.
take a drink every time ken says actually.
Hey, It was kind of advanced for me to do it on my own. What should I learn before doing these projects, can you share some source. Thanks for the amazing video
please improve audio quality
Hi Ken jee, what is the process and techniques to do data mining ?? , do I need to do separate course on data mining for datascience?? I'm stuck in this phase  pls help me out this
Hi Ken. Great video and walk-through. One question - why have you created dummy variables on the numeric features?
Hello Ken. Is there any book that will help me learn which features I should use and which features to drop.
May i ask you which IDE you use to run python codes or for data science works.
Dude you are terrible in explaining things in a pedagogical what. Impossible to follow your quick scrolling.
Can you do more videos on EDA?
I bet The Countess survived :V
Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)

Signed:
A total newbie at this.
I gotta be honest here, started learning Data Science on my own but every now and then I become lazy AF and I just stop for a period of 2-3 weeks. It's difficult to be consistently committed to the program and learning. Although I hope I slowly complete the training.
Hi Ken....Deniz is speaking from Turkey! Your videos are helping me a lot! You force me to keep up :)
"y_hat_base_vc = voting_clf.predict(x_test_scaled).astype(int)
basic_submission = {'PassengerId': test_data.PassengerId, 'Survived': y_hat_base_vc}
base_submission = pd.DataFrame(data=basic_submission)
print(base_submission)
base_submission.to_csv('base_submission.csv', index=False)" 
I executed the above code(same as Ken used) but i getting an error as "array length 889 does not match index length 418".
Can anyone please help me?
U have a best data science chanel, I love u
Wow what a in-depth analysis. You really put a lots of efforts into this. This is my first try in Kaggle too, after spending this much time i wonder how much time it will take for even tougher Data , i also checked the House Rent Competition. It have 81 Features. how can we do such a detailed analysis on all the features. Not sure how the real-world ML problems are solved where they might have 100 or even more features. I am really excited to know more :)
This video is a great help!
Hello Ken, really cool video. I have a question for you. You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around 32:30. I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? 
If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would "spit" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model. 
This is my first data science project, so I want to apologize in advance if my words do not sound "data sciency" enough.
Hi, Ken, when tuning the model for random forest, you use RandomizedSearchCV and then GridSearchCV. Your comment is 
"Because the total feature space is so large, I used a randomized search to narrow down the paramters for the model. I took the best model from this and did a more granular search "
Do your mean the GridSearchCV' parameters are based on the its above RandomizedSearchCV' results?
The brightness is very high . I cant see the wall clocks...
First of all Thanks Ken for this, and secondly it's a request if you can make a dedicated video on how data analysis can work in cricket, I know you may not be knowing about the game but I really want to implement some data analysis into the game of cricket, so just need your help and it will do great if you make a video on the same. Have a good day mate.
Hi, Ken, what's the purpose of log norm the fare? And why we need to scale the 'Age','SibSp','Parch','norm_fare'
Sadly, the Captain did NOT survive
Not gonna lie, when I first saw the Name of the video, I thought this was about some kind of kegel exercise
bro your videos are very helpful...please suggest me. how do I increase my data preprocessing, data analysis skills. few tips ?
Thanks Ken... I just got my physics degree and i want to become a data scientist..Your videos are helping a lot! Thanks
Thank you for this. This was my dabble in data science and I may not have understood all of what you did, but I'm happy I tried it. Where should I go from here? I am thinking about taking the data science bootcamp course on Udemy.
Thanks Ken!
Hi Ken, any tips for freshers ?
Hello really appreciate your efforts.
I'm ML beginner, done with only theory algorithms no hands on experience yet.
How should I start and from where ? Need few suggestions.
Thanks ken‚Äî never used Kaggle or even done any data science projects. The detailed analysis (including the nuances MOST IMPORTANTLY) is really making this digestible‚Äî not to mention applicable
Amazing video! I hope you do a similar video on regression and clustering problems in the future!
Hey,
I am a new fork üòÅ
I just want to know what can be considered as a good score for this problem?
I scored 0.75837
And I see thousands of people with score of perfect 1

So just confused ü§™

Please help me with you thoughts
This is great walkthrough for beginner like me. Thanks Ken Jee
Hi Ken, great video. Thank you!
Please consider making a similar video with panel data!
Hi Ken, I have to predict a binary classification, the dataset has two columns with monetary information, both have right-skewed distribution. If i scale columns and /or apply log transformations, accuracy gets worse. Why could that be ? Even by removing outliers (percentile 98 or 99) it also gets worse, Thanks !
is regression or classification harder? I don't know which one I should start learning first. In stats, we only learned regression and never classification. Thanks
Loving this video and the thumbnail dude!
Hi Ken, thanks for the help on learning about data science. I struggle a lot using Kaggle to learn python. The user experience for me is quite intimidating compared to other platforms I used as there are times even when I know the question, I get lost on how to answer and follow the steps.
Thank you for the great video! It's very helpful! ^_^
Hi Ken, your videos are really helpful for beginners like me. Can you do a similar walk-through video for House Prices problem as well.... thanks in advance.
Ken,  I really love what you do on your channel.  I hope you don't mind, but I've mentioned your channel on my first Medium article about my story. posted here:
https://medium.com/@davidlee_41200/my-inspirational-journey-in-starting-data-science-with-no-code-experience-through-12-weeks-of-35362800886a
You can delete my post as I'm not trying to self promote here. 
Thank you for what you do man!  I'm starting bootcamp tomorrow while learning from your channel as well.
Hi why did you type training["train_test"] = 1
test['train_test'] = 0
test['survived'] = np.NaN
Love your content man! Keep it up 100k subs is just around the corner!
Looking forward to more videos like this . It's incredibly helpful to get an experienced viewpoint on how to think about and dissect these sorts of problems.
You have saved us hours of self-exploration! Thank you, Ken :D Hope you can make more videos like this!
Hey Ken, 
I have recently did my submission for this topic on KAGGLE. I got a score of 79.904% on my 2nd second submission using KNN for classifying. I have submitted my notebook under the title "TOP 9%: 0.79904 USING KNN".I want to score above 80%.
Can you please check and like give me feedback about how I did and what I should improve on?
I think it would be great if you could show how you would present this project in a markdown file in order to add it to your github. Thanks for the great work!!!
Hi Ken, 
I know this is not a  correct forum to ask this.....but still
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62978419/creating-a-new-corpus-with-nltk-nlp
can you help me with this......thanks in advance!!!!:)
Hello,
Thanks for the video. I heard you told about deep learning for this dataset (included categorical and non categorical features). It is a typical data that we usually see. Could you please make a video and build a deep learning model?
I‚Äôd be super interested in seeing you competing in a real Kaggle Competition.
May I know the best laptop for data scientist? ^^
Hey, Ken can you tell me how cloud computing is connected with data science...and from where to start for this field?
You‚Äôre content is always top class Ken! As a beginner in this field you‚Äôve taught  me so much through your videos. Please keep them coming
I don't understand who are these people to dislike. If you can't support him stop disliking him at least someone is putting in efforts to make knowledge and learning process easy what is the problem of you dislikers.
thanks for this video
Thanks a lot ken jee
Ken Jeeüëçüëçüëç
Hey Ken, Amazing video. Where did you learn the feature engineering?. I am always stuck in that part of the projects.
Udacity or Coursera to gain valuable data science knowledge???
Literally was looking at this today
I am glad that I came across your channel. Always wanted to try titanic dataset on kaggle but didn't. now I m gonna try it. thanks.
This video came at such good timing! I just taught myself python and started the titanic project today but was feeling so unsure about everything! Thank you for your videos!!
Hey Ken! Nice video :) how old were u when u started your data science career? I know it‚Äôs a weird question to ask, but still I am little curious to know as I am currently planning to shift my career into Data science field. I am 24 years old and working in Project management. Also I have a bachelors in Mechanical engineering which i think is far away from data science.
Love your videos, Ken. They are no-nonsense and stick to just DS. Your content is well made up and your voice is clear. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. I am sure with such quality content you will soon hit 100k subscribers and more.
Amazing!, i learn a lot with your videos, thanks for sharing your knowledge, hug from Argentina!
Since you made a confession at the beginning, Imma hit you with one myself: I'm been trying to study DS consistently for a year and half and bruh... I find it incredibly frustrating. I do not feel particularly smart enough to do projects on my own but I really like your content, so I will stick around. üò¨
Thanks Ken! I'm working on the same competition and that was super helpful! Quick Q - I'm trying to build up my DS portfolio, do you think it's worth my time to do the whole thing from scratch (i.e. EDA, feature engineering, modelling) and to dwell a bit more on the theoretical stuff? Put another way, is it more important in these types of projects to show knowledge of how these models actually work, or to show that you can use tools and libraries (like sklearn) proficiently?
I sense a rising Kaggle Grandmaster in the future!
Great job! Thank you so much! 
Sadly, I have some work at college and couldn't finish the video but I will definitely come back to it hopefully next week.
Great video dude, exactly what i was looking for, its really great to see creators actually listening to the audience and working on it.

Keep it up pal
This video was extremely helpful, I have been searching the internet for a video that would walk me through this exact project! Your videos are the best, keep up the good work!
This is just great
I've been following your videos for a while now and making my way through all the microcourses on Kaggle. This is the exact video I was looking for to begin the next stage of learning by diving into some data science projects . Top content and keep up the great work Ken!
Aw, kaggle series here we goooo ‚ô•Ô∏è
Great job..Please do these sort of videos more often!
Man, great video! I'm starting on data science and this hands on project explanation was super helpfull!
It was a very insightful explanation of this project, really liked it.

And, at cell [5] if you execute training.describe(include = "all"), it will also give you the values which appear the most for every categorical variable. Which I think can be really helpful.
This was much needed... Thank you very much!!l
Thank Ken Jee 
For spending your time during this lockdown for educating youngsters like us
Hi ken Great Video, I just completed your 7 part data science from beginning series. I am a beginner in data science and your video helped me a lot. Thanks üòä
Thank You  Ken for providing this video...your new subscriber from India...üß°‚úå
Nice insights Ken Jee. In fact I remember working with this dataset in my early days of ML :)
Thanks Ken, I was waiting for this video , Good Luck
Learned something new - VotingClassifier!
Thanks!
Keep up with great the work you've been doing in this channel ken, really helping us beginners.

Hi Ken, Please create a separate play list for kaggle videos. üôÇ
Thanks a lot Sir, this help me a lot to clear my doubts.
Ken, Great video and great initiative! Sounds like fun, I also haven't done a Kaggle submission yet, will follow your path and do one soon.
Thanks! I will try to do this alongside your video! :D

Thanks guys. Very informative video and inspiring as well.
I‚Äôm getting my masters in Earth Systems science. Recently found a passion for the machine learning side of our field. Something I‚Äôm going to try and resist is the idea of further formal education and just teach myself what I need to know.
Great episode once again. My learnings is to create a journal to write down what you‚Äôre learning, how you did it and what next. And I‚Äôll take it a step further and share it with the world. Thank you for sharing this conversation
This was such a fun conversation to watch! Learned a lot. Thank you for this! Definitely following Daniel!
Currently teaching myself python/sql/ML and this is 100% the best video i‚Äôve come across. Incredibly inspiring. I feel a lot more motivated and feel a greater sense of clarity in terms of which direction I need to go and what approach/steps I need to take in order to move in that direction. 

Appreciate you both and hope you have Daniel on again soon!

Fellow aussie from Sydney üá¶üá∫
I took his Data Science Bootcamp course on Udemy that course has so much value for beginners.
Love this guy‚Äôs honesty and humility.
That is a very nice conversation... The points I like most are,
1. Trial and Error- try to do as many experiments as you can and reduce the time been them.
2. Rubberduck is the best one.
3. Three things- Smart, happy and useful. Also, things that might not work are used for learning.
4. Building skill, sharing work (Ken also say this very often as it is really essential.

Thank you to both of you...
Wow, that's so inspiring! I aspire to do that ML thing too, although I have no previous background in science or hardcore math. So, hearing about real humans doing stuff from scratch helps me to believe in myself. Thank you!
You drove Uber on the weekends, and just studied ML all week long?
Some nice nuggets in here.  Marketing yourself truth quality content can def help with getting a job.
Can't wait to see your BJJ match
I am a software engineer from .net background and it's been barely a month journeying into data science. Your channel is an inspiration. I look forward to learning more from your channel. Cheers from Rwanda (East Africa).
Brazil !
Realizing that my odds of establishing a lush career in the field of data science in my middle to upper 40s are at a probability of close to zero given my past employment history going all the way back to dropping out of high school, this video gives me hope that anything is possible with enough devotion, dedication , desire, and willpower!
Wow, I'm amazed by this.
Just completed the dog vision project in Daniel's course. Throughout the course I've dreamt to one day become as proficient as him.
Turns out that he didn't know much about computers just four years ago.

I need to improve our find excuses than a non programming background now.
So much applicable useful information in this video, thanks again Ken!
2 legends and both do BJJ
I really enjoy both interviews! I remember back then in the end of 2018 when I decided to study ML by my own during my master in physics. Daniel's channel got my motivated, inspired and informed about the online courses out there. Today I work as a Data Scientist in an amazing company that produce plant-based foods trying to imitate animal products using artificial intelligence. I recently found your channel Ken, and it have very honest advices and great material to people that want to start in Data Science and also people in the industry already! Thanks to both of you guys!!!
PD: Can you share the podcast with Elon Musk? :)
Very enlightening to hear from someone with Daniel's background. As a recent biomedical science graduate and nutrition/fitness obsessive, I identify with this story to an uncanny degree... Only difference is I eventually got into medicine and only now started with coding/machine learning!
The best guy to motivate,  that nothing is impossible you only need the determination to do it. :)
I would pay money to see that Brazilian jiu-jitsu match!
Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview. I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day... we all could use some confidence and motivation.
Super video. Super inspiring. Only wished that the background music was more calm. :(
Hey Ken, great video as always! I have been looking for a specific dataset where I can do a project using clustering and classification. I have been having trouble finding a good one on Kaggle and GitHub, do you have any specific datasets that you recommend  (beginner/intermediate level)? Thank you so much again for the content, your channel has been my main source of guidance on my data science journey, I couldn't do it without you!
"In the short term progress disappoints but in the long run it surprises." Love it. @53'30"
Your channel is really helping lives in my school. I'm from Nigeria and most of us get into this machine learning thing self taught and your channel has given a lot of insights to this thing and for that I want to say a big THANK YOU! üñ§
Sir I really enjoyed this interview and one thing I notice unique from your other videos and that is your energy your energy was so high interviewing denial and i loved that very much.
That's so awesome. I've been following both of you for a while. I really like how he just explored everything till he found something he liked.
Inspiring...
Awesome i'm inspired
Dang... all the nerds doing bjj these days.  Me included.
Thanks a lot Daniel & Ken for putting it together.
I do have a question for both of you : How do you keep your concentration levels high when you are reading a book cover to cover ? It's a lot of stuff.
I tend to lose my interest after reading a book for about 2-3 hours. At the end of the day, when I look back, I have just skimmed through the pages and I can recall maybe  1 or 2 topics at most.
Wow!155 likes and 0 dislikes.This interview was very good. Waiting for your Kaggle projects video!
This is extremely useful. I realized I was so wrong about some learning approaches and practices (I'm a pure beginner). Very informative.
For more coding stuff subscribe #Indieducate
Really awesome interview.  Thank you Ken and Daniel!
Both of you are really amazing. glad to say that i learned hell lot of things from you too. looking forward for more colabs.
"You are a lot smarter doing things than you are  thinking about things." - Best quote I'be heard in a long time. Thank you for this interview. As an Uber driver, this has been beyond words inspiring and helpful.
Is it too old to become ml engineer at 25?
this is so dope. Daniel is my inspiration in many aspects from learning to health! This is two of my favorite AI youtubers colab!
We are getting together a group of friends and self teaching ourselves ML right now!
The Biggest Data Science Crossover to happen
Honestly, if 1 out of 3 is gonna fail, then the system is the biggest problem. It just means the admissions team didnt do a good job filtering out those who lack a crucial background in bio, and the curriculum along with the support system lacks quality. A school with a good system would only see 5-10% drop out rate at most.
Very very inspiring!!!!!! Thank you for this! :D
Excited for this collab & to listen to Daniel's journey!
Can't wait!!!
Looking forward to this! Agreed with Joseff, this is going to be legendary üëç
Whoaaaa üò±üò±üò±üò± this is gonna be epic
Damn excited two fav YouTubers on Colab üî•üî•üî•üî•
Special thanks again to Shivam for submitting his github portfolio! If you want to have your projects, resume, or github reviewed, please comment below and send your work to kenjee.ds@gmail.com! Link to Import Data's github header video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_RDoNJ1zGg
What do you recommend doing for a review of the interpretability of project outcomes. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm working on an econometrics project on my own, what‚Äôs the best place or way to review that I‚Äôm drawing the correct conclusions from my results? A lot of data science online sources simply take you through the code and the outputs but don‚Äôt go into how to make sure you‚Äôre drawing all conclusions from the model.
Another nice video.

Ken, I have a question here. Which one is better, do we have to put one project in one repository or do we put several projects in one repository? For instance, this repository is a repository for the projects that I have done by taking a dataset from Kaggle. 

Thank you Ken
As usual, great content and pragmatic tips! Thanks for doing this. Hoping one day to get my projects reviewed! This might be slightly out of place but I have been meaning to ask about your ring, It's prominent and elegant and I was wondering where can I get myself one of those :P
thanx, this is useful.
Loved this videoüòá,
I am excited to share my GitHub as well.
First, great video and definitely a great series Ken.

In few weeks i will be ready to submit my github. 
Merging all the recommendation given by Ken Jee. 

Can't wait :)
Helo sir, I am DHEERAJ KUMAR  I have mailed you my GitHub link and Portfolio last month, kindly request you to review it sir
bhut hi bdiya mere bhai shivam..
i am on my way to doing my first project and i hope you can review my portfolio then
Hey ken! Loving the series! I wanted to make a suggestion since I don't have a decent portfolio yet to submit it for your analysis. I think you should make a series solving actual data science tasks and problems that Data Scientists face daily. I think it would be very innovative and reaaaaally helpfull to beginners like me. Greeting from Brazil!
I'm almost ready to submit my projects/portfolio to this series! Another great review video Ken!
Thank you Ken, for the feedback. I have jotted down all your points and will be working on these in the coming months. 
Anybody who is interesting in learning together by doing some Kaggle Projects as mentioned, connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivam-jalotra-39b019159/ or shoot me an email: jalotrashivam9@gmail.com.
\(*0*)/ It would be really great if you reviewed my github! Actually, for now It is still a student profile. But You could show good insights for me and others.
Oh, I'll submit properly in some minutes, but if you can look at it right know: pauloreis-ds


Thank you! It makes all the difference have a mentor like you.
Hey bro, just wanted to let you know that 6 months of studying later, I may have a job lined up! I did the interviews and skills tests just waiting on the word. Fingers crossed ü§ûüèΩ
Thanks Ken for another great video! Noticed your iPad? touchscreen notebook? has a mirrored display of your camera. Would love to learn what software you're using for that ü§î
Thanks, Ken for sharing my video! I agree with you about linking projects on the GitHub profile page. That will help employers view your projects more readily! üòÑ
loved this mate!!
Nice nice nice üëçüëçüëç
I love your content ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for watching everyone! I hope this video was helpful to you. If you're new to data science, I recommend watching this new playlist I just put together: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs . I took all of the best videos I made for beginners and threw them in here!
If you just want to jump into my recommendation you can skip to 2:50!
Would you recommend Beelink Ser6 -p as mini pc for data science?
the whole setup is costlier than my Data Science Fees
Hi. Do you know which of these CPUs will perform better in machine learning and data science tasks, no need to say I would use a Nvidia GPU like 3070 besides the cpu, but I wanna choose an appropriate cpu for these types of tasks. These are my choices:
1. 5900X      :$250
2. 13600KF :$400
3. 13700KF:   $500
Is ryzen 3 acceptable when starting my career in data science?
great hawaiian shirt bro, where can i buy one?
Useless video
Ken, do data science learners need a specific size of GPU (I was wondering about Intel iris xe, bcs some people said size of it is 4gb, but it is not that good)? what's your opinion
Hello, Where do i learn about pc hardware specs for beginners.
@Ken Jee, even though I'm watching this on 8/20/2021, thanks for the vid! I'm in my first year of a business analytics/data science program and about to build a new system for work/play. The information has pointed me in the right direction because it focused on my main first goals, analytics, and data science capabilities. Keep up the good work. Thanks again!
Hi Ken! I'm hoping you can give me advice on deciding which lenovo ideapad slim 3 that has most value for money :
ryzen 3 5300u (567 usd)
ryzen 5 5500u (635 usd)
Core i5 1135g7 (676 usd)
ryzen 7 5700 (711 usd)

My main needs are SQL, Tableau, Python/R, and Spreadsheets.

Thanks in advance!
I got  Acer Aspire 7 and is perfectly doing its job .
256GB is NOT enough! If you had to install several operating systems you'd be screwed!
I am sorry, 256G of hard drive for data science ?  I really think you should do a few data science projects before you start recommending these specs.  256G even for a regular system might not be enough (even considering the fact that lot of data is stored in cloud).  For data science you should be looking at TBs of hard drive space.
Hey SSD stands for Solid State Drive not steady state drive. Just wanted to let you know.
can i use a rx 580
were you a rower? heard you say "steady-state" drive and threw me for a loop lol
What about linux or macos or windows? It would be amazing to make video adv and disadv of them in data science:)
@Ken Jee I have one question on this... Even if someone have good knowledge and some experience but companies give different role instead of what we want so what to do in that case?
Hi Ken. It will be great if you share your opinion about the new M1 MacBooks for the field of data science, especially for beginners. Thanks!
Hi Ken Jee! I have a macbook pro 16 2019 but i need it to work with Power BI and Power Query. I am struggling with that. I may probably need to buy another computer. What do you suggest?
Hey, could you make a vid explaining how to get a gpu in the cloud in your laptop, I have all specs but my gpu is integrated.
Hey ken. I know it's  a off topic for this video but I only know you an IT expert who can answer my questions. I want to learn android development . I am already a web developer. But I am not sure if I need a computer science degree to become a android developer. So can you tell me do I need a computer science degree in order to become a android developer or can become a self-taught android developer.
A quick question
Is it possible to run CUDA on an AMD CPU ? (Yes *CPU* , not talking about GPU)
I bought a $699 Lenovo IdeaPad flex 5 laptop as i was a newb and didn't know about the gpu requirement. This one has an AMD Radeon gpu. I have the option to cancel the order. Should i cancel it?
Nice home exterior view u have.
Thanks for the content Ken but SSD stands for solid state drive not stead(y).
ÏºÑÏßÄ Ïß±!
Hey Ken,
How do you go about classifying data as unknown aka outside the distribution that the training classes fall into? My neural net softmax probs are high for data that should be unknown
I've got a Ryzen 7 computer with 32G RAM and NVIDIA 2080 Ti, since I'm going to almost exclusively work with neural networks. My professor has 128G RAM and claims that isn't enough for the real-life tasks :)
I don't really like Colab for the serious work. First, the session expires pretty quickly, and you should fall to the shameless tricks to keep it. Second, transferring gigabytes of data for training via Internet may nullify all the advantages of TPUs. Colab is great for the small learning or experimental projects, but it can't train a BERT-based network that required more than a day on my 2080 Ti.
Ken Jee, tell me please! SSD on SATA 3.0 for what kind of work in data science we can use? And for SSD on NVMe the same question) hope you understand what do i mean) Thanks a lot for your videos, interesting to listening to you!
Thanks, Ken, for this! You're simply amazing!
Please upload more data science project as well like krish naik üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Ken, Thanks for another quality video! This is a golden piece of advice on the million dollar question. The 3 tier starter specs are really useful starting point for building our own PC. Currently most of my work are down on my MacBook and run on the cloud. Will definitely, re-watch this video when I actually go and build my own PC.
Nice guidance Video.
Video quality is increased so greatly.
Sir, I request you to interview Joma Tech
I recently switched from a Hewlett Packard Spectre 13 (8 GB RAM, 1 TB M.2 2880 SSD, Intel i5) to a Lenovo ThinkCentre M700 (16 GB RAM, 512 GB SATA III SSD, Intel i5-6400T) for data science. The impetus for the migration was my need for an ergonomic keyboard because modern notebook computer keyboards are terrible for extended typing sessions. Eventually, I will add an NFS server providing easily expandable file storage but that is likely a project for next year as part of a larger re-architecture project for my home office network and computing hardware.
a year ago i built a computer for ML and DL , Thanks Ken , another great video as usual
Awesome video ken, just a quick note there , it would have been HDD and not HHD :p. Else it was yet again a great watch
Tell me more about that usb-c graphics card tech for laptops.
Thank you so much Ken for your awesome videos
Hey, Ken. I'm using Asus Vivobook. What can you say about it? Thanks
I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.

What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.

The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.

Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?

Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.

My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.

For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.

For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.

For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.

For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.

For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.

Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.

Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.

As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.

Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.

Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.
Great video ken . Keep them coming.
This video came at the perfect time! I‚Äôm leaving for grad school soon doing an MS in Data Science and Analytics, and my laptop is about 10 years old and hella slow. I desperately need a new one but as a student I don‚Äôt have the budget for another Apple product.
Thank you ken :-)
That GPU looks like a monster :O
Can't imagine the performance difference with that!
Have you considered doing a video discussing the different operating systems? Lots of conflicting opinions between Windows, Mac, and Linux and very few resources for data science specifically. Would be great to hear your opinion on this matter
Can you show us how to get/use GPU resources from online such as Amazon service or Google platform?
I tried, but felt a little hard
Hey Ken, how're you? Great video once again :)
Apart from MacBook and Dell XPS what are the other laptop suggestions you have?
The video I've been waiting for! I'ma save some money and go for the mid tier one as I wanna get back into gaming!
Great video. 

I have question.. Can i practice Deep learning using Google colab/ kaggle notebooks?
Ken, what about the keyboard? I see you're using a Durgod Hades 68. Do you think a mechanical keyobard is worth the investment? Also, do you think that a TKL keyboard work just fine for doing data science?
Great content as usual, thank you for your insight!
Great video! Always informative.
AMD Ryzen series is awesome, I just rebuilt with that and an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT. Absolutely awesome.
Thanks for making this video Man ...!! I have  never own a Laptop or system before it's more helpful to understand the requirements of a system....! Actually I'm also planning to buy a Laptop for learning DS big thumbs up to u man.....! But the problem is there is no such laptops under the price range of 500 $ with the specs u would mention in the video üòîüòî could u pls suggest some if u don't bother abt the mentioning......!
For beginners, go with what you have. Of course it is nice to have high specs, but to get started you dont need that much power. You can do pretty much anything on kaggle, googlw colab, or native jupyter notebook. If you get professional enough, you will need what kind of computer you need. 

For much of data cleaning and learning and linear regression, average computer is just fine. You dont need nvidia cuda cores for that. Waste of money for beginning.
Nice content Ken üëç
Great video, I have a gaming pc build that I use but yours if one of the first I‚Äôve seen on DS PCs
Hi Ken,
Could you do a video (or videos) on machine learning on the cloud? I see GCP, Azure and AWS have a lot of services that help you setup your ML environment on the cloud. I believe this is going to be the future where creating a ML pipeline using cloud services is going to be crucial considering that the data usually exists on the cloud and training on the cloud is cheaper that racking up physical resources.
Thanks Ken for this informations.üôÇ
that slow transition into tech review for data science ;) I see you Ken
I have only been looking at DS for two years but I built my first PC at 11 in 1994 and I did it professional for a while, so I know I have built and setup at least 5000 computers. I would choose a Mac with parallels, without a doubt. Then you can use OSX, Windows and Linux. I won‚Äôt go into specs, since I do a lot of 3D modelling in Inventor I know I set the limit quite high.
Thanks for this video!
How about Apple Mac Book Pro ??  I am planing to buy , is apple laptop is good for data science  ?? any suggestion please. Thank you :)

Could I be successful majoring in Data Science and minoring in Computer Science? I recently just switched my major and minor choice because of personally preference.
I'm a second-year Economics student. Do you think I can make the switch? I'm unclear on how to pursue data science from here.
Awesome content üëè
Hey, I came across your channel and I have a question.  I'm currently a junior in high school and I've been intrigued by data science for a while and want to study it in college.  As a result, I've been taking courses like AP  Computer science A ( in java),  AP Stats, and AP calc AB. But what do you suggest I should do or best prepare for an undergraduate degree in data science? 


Thank you.
I am currently an Electrical Engineer and I always felt that my strongest side was in programming and mathematics. I always struggled with the hardware side of EE and was looking to change into another major. What are your opinions on a switch to DS? I have taken Statistics before and enjoyed the class as a tid bit.
Hey Ken I am currently pursuing my ms in DS but want to continue my studies further will phd be a wise option if I want to work in industry and not planning to go into academia?
 Or will MBA be a good option since DS needs some buisness knowledge?
i posted this comment below an other video in data science.
i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips.
I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. 
A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc.
I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually "suck" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills.
So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa.
i would like to have your opinion about this tips.
thanks.
regard from italy :)
I am interested in field of x-informatics  or data driven science or computational science(which has a major chunk of data science).How would you recommend me to proceed?
My university now offers a dual-degree in computer science and data science that has all of the computer science major courses and some statistics and data science courses. I'm not sure whether or not I should major in CS and continue into an MS in CS and take grad courses related to data science or if I should get the dual-degree in CS and DS. Is the bar for entry in the U.S. for data science/machine learning a graduate degree or could I have job prospects with an undergrad?
Sir, I want to ask you how many years will data science rule in the number 1 demand for IT profession job
Ken sir, I want you to add as many projects and courses in your videos as you can
Hey ken what would u say about self taught data scientists? Can they never become good data scientist like others? Are data scientist roles in companies can only be play by degree holders? What will employers think about that data scientist?
Ken sir i want you to mention courses as much as you can in your videos because that will be alot helpful to us and thank you for this amazing video i really learned alot from this video
I see a crazy hype for Data Science roles/jobs in India, is it the same abroad like in US,EU,Australia,Zealand and Canada?
This video could not have been timed better. I am literally meeting with my counselor next Monday to discuss switching from CS to a undergraduate DS class. Thank you!!
What is the difference between taking an online MS data science program vs. an on-campus MS data science program?

If someone chooses an undergraduate degree in data science, in my opinion, they should take first and second year courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science as electives if their data science degree lacks courses in those subjects. I am currently enrolled in an undergraduate data science degree after taking over 60 credit hours in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
This advice by Jaemin is spot on and your own videos are very useful.
Right before the pandemic I switched over to Data Science from Agriculture. I am currently studying Computational & Data Science B.S. with a Minor in SE. 

Then I will go for a Software Engineering M.S. The undergrad degree is more modeling based... they teach R & Fortran. I am learning Python on my own, this fall I will be starting a 2-part Python certificate, 1 part intermediate 2 part advanced. I hope this is the right track? I want to learn SQL additionally.
I am an undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering.
Could you have a look at these Master's Programme and suggest me which is more relevant to the current industry requirements? Note : I have offers for all 3 programmes mentioned
1 . QMUL - https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/big-data-science-msc/#course-study (Modules excluded for my intake (ECS789P - Semi-Structured Data and Advanced Data Modelling
                                                                        ECS7001P - Neural Networks and NLP) )
2. Glasgow - https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/datascience/#tab=structure
3. Surrey - https://www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/data-science-msc-2020#modules-sn
Huge Thank You to both of you!!! <3
I am currently interning as a Software Release Engineer and will be moving to a Machine Learning role in December, is it okay if I do the ML from December to August and then Statistical Consulting at another place from August to December and then go back to ML?
I‚Äôm currently doing a masters in ds with a heavy stats component. I transferred from the same course at a different institution that had one stats unit. Do you think this is a good move for my career?
Tough call but I'd say CS or SE not particularly data science it's better to choose after you know most of the stuff that a computer student would know which you will learn in BS CS or SE, then  go for a specialized field
It would also be nice to here what y'all think about a Masters program in Data Science vs something more traditional like CS or Stats. (especially curious about degrees labelled "Masters in Professional Studies". like are employers put off by that vs an MS?)
Hey Ken would you recommend DePaul's MS in DS or MS in CS? I know you did CS just wondering your thoughts.
Thank you for an opportunity to speak to your viewers, Ken! Hope this can help many students who want to pursue their careers in data science!
Thanks for watching everyone! To have your resume or projects reviewed for the series, please comment  below and email me at kenjee.ds@gmail.com. I got locked out of my personal website so I haven't made the changes on there yet. Soon to come https://kennethjee.com/resume/
Thankyou for such informative content! Ken Jee! üôå‚ù§Ô∏è I would highly appreciate it if you can review my resume since i am also aspiring to be a Data Scientist in the future üòä
Hi Ken. Your advices are really helpful and your work is praiseworthy. Just wondering if you could make a video on how to write a cover letter..Thanks..
You‚Äôre a LEGEND Ken!! I only discovered your channel today and I am HOOKED! I started learning to code (in python) 2 weeks ago and am starting my first k-means clustering project with a dataset about penguins today!! Thanks to your videos (and introducing me to Kaggle), I‚Äôm feeling so much less terrified!! Keep up the amazing content - I feel so motivated thanks to you!! üëèüëèüëèüëè
Helpful Tip for Adobe Illustrator (CS6 version is what I use but will still have it in other versions): They do have spell check.  You just click on the top menu bar "Edit > Check Spelling" or Ctrl+I for the shortcut.  Coming from an art background, I would still advise giving Adobe Illustrator another shot.  It takes a bit getting used to but you will always have more control with programs like this that are meant for better, professional design.  Great videos, love the content.
Your videos are so informative! You brought up a lot of good points and it was nice to see Dos as well as Don'ts. I haven't watched many of your videos yet, but I am interested in your thoughts about how one gains "domain knowledge" as I have noticed it is not discussed often in online materials (but it is often mentioned in my MS data science program). If you already have a video about this, I will make sure to search further!

When I started my program, I was sure I wanted to work in marketing research (I have a BBA), but now I'm distracted by all of the shiny new concepts I can learn in school. Now, I'm considering a second master's and not sure if I should do computer science, software engineering or marketing research. Decisions, decisions, but 5 AM probably isn't the best time to be making life decisions.... üòÇ
Cool video , but why three clocks?
Hi Ken! Thanks for this amazing video! Can I ask you where you did your resume? I mean which program or web site you can recommend and why? I know you mentioned MS Word, but it very poor on design.
Hey Ken, super insightful video! I understand you should always show results in your work experiences, but how would you do that for data analytics/BI experiences e.g. designed dashboards, built charts, prepared reports, cleaned up data, ran ad-hoc data analysis, etc. 
I have listed SQL (BigQuery) and working git,python and tableau knowledge in my skills section, currently facing problems in quantifying achievements, thanks in advance!
Hi Ken, i have strong fundamentals on programming, and I can easily learn math , but i don¬¥t know anything related to neither business things nor economics topics... is this mandatory to become a data scientist? And if so, do you know where can i learn it?
Ken - you've made a great niche that fills a big need. Thanks for your support of the emerging data science community.
hey man, i know basic/intermediate programming in R/Pyhton so that i can introduce algorithms from libraries- like lm() in R-Studio. Right now i think the next best step would be to improve my programming skills since i study econometrics/statistics for the theoretical basis. What would be the best way to do that?  It would also be interesting to know if you as a full Data Scientist use libraries or if you just program the algorithms for yourself. Thanks in advance for an answer :)

Hey Ken, should I include those projects that I learnt from YouTube tutorials or online courses in my resume. Like the one you made data science salary predictor which I followed from start to end and made a proper website for it and deployed it on heroku.
Hi Ken is this normal in the USA no photo ?  If you don't have photo here in Europa most likely you will get no interview...  Culture difference?
@Ken Jee, this was easily one of your very best videos man. Top notch stuff. Now I am 200% confident about what to write in my resumes and how to present it, thanks to you.
quick question, did you really master all the programming languages? It is a lot on your resume.
Hey got your video recommended and loved it, now I will binge watch all your content it's really helpful thank you so much.
I am going to pursue master's in engineering science ( data science) from suny buffalo so your videos are going to help me alot for building a good profile related to data science.
Really appreciate your work üòä
Great content, I love the fact that you stated the books you've read and enjoyed in the resume. Lighting really helps with better video quality
Hello Ken, I am an arising Junior at UC Davis studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science. I was wondering if it's possible that you can look over my resume as I'm preparing for internships in Data Science and Data Analytics. Keep up the insightful content on your channel and I hope you continue to succeed in your career :'))

Hi bro
Can we become a good data scientist without unversity
People are confused by inner words and outside noise about when to start, stop or continue certain work. The right answer is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cG1xfSyIQ
I'm hooked to your channel. Your content is relevant and has offered me insights and motivation on this journey that I started one year ago. Thank you very much for sharing your time and knowledge...
All the things you said really helped me in my journey of DS.
How do you maintain notes during learning or building projects of data science? I think video or audio recording works better for me....
Thank you for your videos, Ken! I don't have any math background besides Stats 101. What level of stats would be helpful to get started in data science?
I greatly appreciate your channel.  I am always trying to figure out if it's best to concentrate on learning how to use one tool like Pyramid and be proficient, especially when you don't quite have the time to learn to code as well.  What's your take?
Free courses of data Science please...
ken Jee sir ,,,what are the things should i learn to become a data scientist ...
Hi Ken, I am an Entrepreneur in manufacturing and holds a masters degree in manufacturing as well. Due to pandemic I had to close my business and am looking for opportunities in data science. I have completed few courses including the zero to mastery course by Daniel bourke which helped me create a lot of interest in this field. I am hoping to relate data science with manufacturing. Can you advise me about the same. Is it possible to find a job in data science as I am from a different educational background?
Hi Ken. Based on your experience do you think/consider as possible to start a carrer in data science at 28 age?  I studied industrial engineer and I am interested on it but i ask it because of the needed time, average, to become a good data scientist.  Greetings
Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on "Where" to start learning. But, what you talked about was "How to learn". I mean, the advices were "No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. 

Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.


What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like "Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with..."
I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.

Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job?
I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?

Thank you for your videos, they made me like Data Science even more, even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world.

Wish you success and waiting to see more videos. If not about my request, well, Data Science is already enough for me to follow the channel.
So happy to have found this channel. It's like I found a mentor. Thanks for the videos! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great channel! Linked & Subscribed! 

Do you have books recommendations for the ML concepts? Most books I found explain how to code but I'm more interested in the math & stats behind those concepts.  Thank you
you are the best
Given that I do not work full time current, do you think it would be feasible for me to spend 6-5 hours a day (in 1.5-2hr blocks) learning various Data Science building blocks / projects. I did spend most of my time studying/sitting in lectures back in university, however, not having done that recently may feel a little overwhelming if I do decide to spend that much time on learning again. P.S. I am enrolled in Springboard Data Science Career Track.
Hey Ken,

I'm gearing up to apply for an online master's in DS.  I have a bachelor's in math and an MS in stats from a decade ago that I ended up not really using (long story).  I've started learning python and I'm not completely sucking at it so I feel like I'm on the right track but my math skills are obviously pretty rusty.  Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare? 

 The program itself hasn't even started, UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months.  I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve.
Videos improving every time man ‚ô•Ô∏è
First time I see someone from youtube use Spyder :D
Hey ken great video as always. I feel like on of the things people miss is consistency, if you do just a little but every day you will get there eventually. That‚Äôs actually stuff I talk about on my channel I am Vloging my path from no code to data scientist in 6 months. See ya!
Can anyone pls suggest some good laptops budget of around 50 k for learning & practising Data science....? I need your help i don't have any laptop before so pls help me I want to learn Data science ......! I'm waiting for ur reply... Thanks in advance ..!!
Hello Ken, thank you for sharing your insights. I was curious if you have any videos where you go over soft skills / how to tell a compelling story?
Thnx Ken ! You are my fav YouTuber as a beginner now!
Great video! Thank you for the advice!
Ken Jee :)
I am doing ML right now.
I realized I am not good at Data Structure and Algorithms. I find people advising to learn them.
What should I do?  I have a problem with doing one thing at a time. Please mention importance if any.
Thank you :D
Hai ken thank you for sharing with us the way we should take to learn becoming a data scientist. Honestly, many people still have lack of listening in english, including me. Would u like to add caption in this video? Thank you
hi, thanx for all the videos they r really a great content.
am asking if u can have a video about remote working and internship, because am from morocco and i love data science and am starting learning it but companies in this field here is so rare so am asking if there's a chance to get a remote internship in american companies after i finish my studies and projects ?
Brilliant work as always. Is it true that there are no datascience jobs and internships for freshers that are recently graduated from college or do they need some work experience in order to get a job. Does being a SWE in a big tech company adds as a advantage to get a job or do we have to have datascience domain experience only to get a job in FANG companies. Do reply.
Thanks ken, great video. 

I am on the project level:
I am doing Twitter sentiment analysis and learning NLP.

I have a question, i refer to other people's github for guidance... Like the github i am refering for twitter sentiment analysis uses NLTK but in my project i am using spaCy.. 
Can i show this project in my resume?
Thanks for this Ken. Im learnning Data Science by my own and im trying to find the best type of learning that is best for me, your video helps me a lot, ill try to do more projects and see more the documentation
Really like the advice you give us here, especially the kaggle part! I have been using those trick of reading someone kernel/notebook but it does get overwhelming, so knowing that it's hard for everyone really put me at ease. By the way, would you mind if I email you just to get a piece of advice from you regarding my study path?
What a Irony sir I always gets the solution of my problems every time from your videos at perfect time.
üëçüëçüëç‚ô•Ô∏è
Hey man, really enjoyed your video :).Would like to ask a few things. I've started a data science course on udemy and I would like to know if there's any platform that you know of that would help me practise the concepts I've learned. Let's say I just finished regression, and I want to practice some problems on regression, where should I go.

Also, would it be possible for you to make a Kaggle tutorial that would help us familiarise ourselves with the website? Like I tried to get on Kaggle and found myself lost and everything looked very high profile and I didn't know where to start as a beginner
What do you mean by documentation? You were abit vague there. Could you elebarote on that? THANKS
Hi Ken.... Please do live project or end to end project like you did with data scientist salary prediction

Hi Ken! I have a doubt regarding the projects. It's like what stream should I pick up, should I experiment it first, what suits me where  I should be moving, or else is there any particular domain to start with,  for career options.
The videos you prepare are so on point and informative. It is not vague. The  correct amount of informative touch with a pinch of reality. Hope it gets more amd more better from here. The only video that didnot satisfy me was with jay, it may be the rich content he has in his youtube channel already, you just stopped the questions with few..anyway enjoying the growth..thanks.
Love the B-Roll scenes!  
Huge fan of doing projects to learn. Applying the concepts I learned into projects has helped things stick better for me!
I found your channel just after I started learning Data Science about a couple of months ago, and you've been really helpful and encouraging man.
Keep growing the channel, Ken. 100k is just around the corner!

And I wholeheartedly agree with your tip of reviewing other people's code. My number one tip is to go through GitHub and search by keyword for projects that interest you. From there, you can find people's scripts and run them chunk by chunk. This way you're learning from people that have a good coding foundation. This is one of the methods I used to learn R.
Hi Ken! I‚Äôm a 15 year old in highschool and I just finished a course on Data a science on Udemy. I have attempted a few projects on Kaggle and they‚Äôve worked out pretty well. Do you have any advice on how I can progress further and some goals I can work towards?
Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics. Really like the "rinse and repeat" part, learning data science is indeed a never-ending iteration loop.
Informative tips! Cannot stress the importance of learning how to read documents!
Thanks a lot Ken! Awesome content as always...
That was awesome sir i really loved that and pretty much motivated by that. One unique thing i noticed today was your camera quality(that was awesome)
Hi! I am from India. Here the IIT (India's one of the best technical institution) is going to provide a bachelor degree course of data science. It's a 3 year online course with exams to be attended being present physically in their campuses. So should I just concentrate on that course or complete it side by side along with Computer Engineering?
just loved the image/audio quality on this one! congrats Ken!
Is that the 1080p 34 inch monitor? have the pixels been enough for  you?
Awsome video ken sir..

Time management is one of the most important skills! One of the things I did in college to stay focused & productive was to have a solid wall between the studying/productive time and my leisure time. For instance, I would be productive from 9am-1pm and reward myself by doing something fun (playing games, playing with my dog, etc.) for about an hour! Then I would get back to the productive time from 2pm-7pm and reward myself again!
Keenly waiting. I would really appreciate if you guys would come up with a video on how to start as a datascientist from scratch like a complete beginner to getting a job in FAANG. Discussing everything like how to start of with projects, best resources, how to learn ML and AI and then how to get a job and ace coding interviews stuff like that. Trust me if you do this your podcast or respective channels will explode. Pls do consider to make a podcast on it.

Hello Ken Jee,
Could you please share the template of your resume . I am graduating this year and it would help me a lot .
One thing I would add in here, I've just had a look through his code and one criticism I would have would be around his use of Oversampling. He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage (Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used, some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited) - just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods.
Hello Ken Jee,
I really like your videos. I have one weird request I always wonder what topic( tips, formulas, notes) should we have on walls so that I could go through it every day. And I have seen in some of the videos that you are having some lists (Notes) on your walls. 
If you don't mind can you please make a video or share details on it, please.
Thank you!!
Thank you for your tips, Ken!! Made all the appropriate changes and it definitely feels more like a complete project.
Never seen a project on personal Spotify data. Cool!
Great Content Ken! Keep up the good work.
Hi ken, I have a question, do you know if George Washington university‚Äôs certificate in data analytics is a good way to Start out in data science with someone with no background in data science?
Amazing work cleared a lot of doubts for me. Can you make a video on machine learning engineers getting a job in Google sharing their resume, projects. That would be great. Till then keep up the great work brother.
Ken, Thanks for this amazing video. :)
I did basically the same project a couple months back for one of my classes. Music analytics is really cool :)
you play golf??
Thank you Ken for all those videos, it's very helpfull ! Do you think about making some of your advice's videos as podcast maybe on spotify or any other plateform ?
This series is really helpful üòä
Very cool project! Didn't know you could do this with your personal Spotify data. Thanks for sharing it!
Very informative video!! May I ask what are the important statistics topics for data science?
Could you make a video about best laptops for data science?
This is the best YouTube Channel for Data Science, I am glad to have found it. I will definitely recommend it to fellow Data Science Enthusiasts. 

Thank you Ken, and well done to Isac. There is so much I am learning from this.

P.S: I had a Data Science interview today, I am hoping for a positive response in a few days to allow me dig further into this field.
Hi Ken! Thank for making such amazing videos. Please review my Kaggle notebook. It's a data analytics project and my first Lagge notebook :))

Steller project, I didn't know you could add features to your Spotify data like that. I'm pretty close to finishing my COVID-19 project though so you'll see a request from me any day now!
Thanks Ken for another great review of data science projects. Analyzing these personal spotify data is useful and matters the most to oneself, Great initiative!
This seems so cool! Would you share the github link too? I would love to use this to build my own playlist xD

Hello Ken, I've been working as a Technical Recruiter for past 5 years and started learning Data Science amid 2020. Please let me know if I can apply for DS jobs in FANG Companies. Looking forward to hear from you.. Love from Indiaüôè
Can I get a data science internship at FAANG if I have no experience but good projects and I have done some previous internships? I am starting my masters next year at SJSU. How to get connected with recruiters in bay area for a data science Internship. Any Idea? Do you have any contacts?
ÏºÑÏßÄ Ïß±!
Ken great content as always!  Could you list all the skills that fang would expect from a person to have ?
I've had several recruiters reach out from the FANG companies recently. I'm stunned that they keep telling me that I need to relocate to the Bay Area even after announcing that their workers will stay at home through 2020 at the least. Where is the disconnect?
Really awesome ken! Every video of yours is exceptionally informative,however there's one question that,how much of data structures and algorithms i should know as compared to a software engineer when interviewing at bigwigs. I know about various things to know as a data scientist/ml but how does it differentiate you from a software engineer,a little more insight on what these "coding" requirements are is needed. Thanks in advance!
Great video Ken and other playlists like "Data Science Fundamentals" are awesome too‚ô•Ô∏è
Awesome content!
Do we need a cs degree to get into fang companies?
Hey Ken, it's me again! :) Do you think creating a website - by means of shiny package of R - predicting the nation based on the given answers would be a good project for a freshman economics student being willing to be a data scientist. I mean would it be worth spending my time ? Here's  the draft of it.

(I had no data so I used a pseudo data.) I am planning to rise the number of questions and the quality of them. In addition, I will try to collect my data myself.
Thank you in advance !
Hi Ken, thank you for your contribution in data science field. I have a very general question: I have recently chosen the carrier shift into data science and learned excel, tableau, sql and currently learning python, so how should i cope up with the practice to make sure that I donot forget the usage of previous tools. Is there any way that i stay in touch with all the tools that i learned everyday.
Ur content is one of the best. Can u make a video on which is a better career option....a data scientist or a software developer?
This is really informative
Thanks help full video
Hello, Ken can you please tell me how important it is to learn ML, to learn Data Science? And would you suggest some sources?
Ken, thank you so much for your videos! Right now I'm studying a DS, and your explanations and advices are invaluable. it helps me to understand my teachers and improve my skills. üëç
Hi Mr Ken. Been a self taught programmer and a background in agriculture. I'm looking at the requirements for being a Data Scientist/ML engineer and it's almost overwhelming. How important is learning the maths behind machine learning algorithms and what would you recommend for me given my background?
Ken‚Äôs energy is OFF THE CHARTS. You can tell he‚Äôs living his best life.
Hey Ken.
Thank you really for everything you share with us. I've started my journey in data science a couple months ago. I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist.
I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers.
- with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience?
- I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there.
- how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it.

Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions. Thanks
This discussion is definitely going to be valuable to people who are looking into FANG companies!
Thanks Ken for another quality video! Great insights on the FANG interview process, Jay!
Thank you!! There aren't that many data science youtubers so this is really helpful :)
Hi, i started learning python during the lockdown but I really don't know how to figure out what i want to do with my life going forward after university? Any advice please?
Great video üëç
Thank you so much sir for posting this interview i really wanted this
Amazing work brother. A similar video on the skillsets required to get a job as a machine learning engineer  in FANG companies would be great. Continue the good work brother.
This was super fun! Thanks again for the interview Ken!
Replay gang üëä
Awesome!!
Hey, I want to get more into Business Intelligence but don't know how to get there. Any tips? I'm a Statistics major and a software release engineer intern graduating in 2022.
Hey, is it necessary for data scientists to know html and css?
Hey Ken, 

does it matter whether my project goes into the model production aspects? Would it seem too lackluster to just cover exploratory data analysis aspects? 

Also, does the model production aspect require machine learning? or is it even just things like prediction in regression?

Thanks again!
Another awesome video. Thanks Ken.

By the way, I'm really curious on how if during master/Phd degree, we also have a job as DS in company.  

Please make this video to negotiate yourself, company and college, it will helpful for me and other ‚ò∫Ô∏è
how to get a freelancing/remote job in the current pandemic situation?
are you able to make money via playing numbers?
can you review resumes and portfolio's privately? I mean reviewing them but without putting them on youtube?
I really appreciate your efforts, you are a great person
I want ask you some questions please
1- can i work as a data analyst or data scientist from my home in Egypt at company in America or any country?
2- college degree is an important to work as a data analyst or can i do the job with only my skills??
3- is it too hard to be a data analyst or getting a job, how long it will take in average ??
4- should i be professional to get a job??
Thank you in advance üòò
Learning a lot about the best way to structure my resume from this series!   Looking forward to  impress recruiters at my college starting this fall thanks to this channel!
Special thanks to Keshav for letting me use his project as an example. If you would like to have your project reviewed, please comment below and send me an email at kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
I just spent the last several months learning data science and I thought I was ready to start applying for jobs.  I did so this morning and to my great disappointment, I found that every entry level position required 2 years of experience and already had 100 applicants.  This gives me very unpleasant flashbacks to trying to apply for entry level electrical engineering jobs after I graduated.  I do not believe there is any quantity of hobby projects I could do that would allow me to enter this market.  I'm sorry, but your entire channel is a waste of time.
Awesome suggestion ken! I have known Keshav for quite sometime and iam sure he will go places.
Another awesome video on resume review üòÉüëç
Impressive profile keshav and great suggestions üî•
Thank you so much Ken :)
Awesome portfolio!
Thanks for doing this. Is this from the perspective of the US market?
Hi Everyone! I am really excited for this. It is my first live stream, so please be patient with me as I figure out how to use the technology! 
A few people have reached out about the 365 data science discount, here is the link for 20% off: https://365datascience.pxf.io/NjbEv
Finished the ML mini course in kaggle..now home prices project...and just about to watch this video...
I want to build a chatbot for depression how to gather data?  What kind of data do I need?
congratulation
It‚Äôs great seeing this channel grow so fast. Congratulations Ken üéâ.
Congrats on 50k subs. It‚Äôs great to see your channel continue to grow and how much progress you have made in the past few months. Keep up the good work!
Congrats Kenüëè
if we replace base estimator Decisiontree with Kernalized SVM in randomforest, how will affect decision boundary? and how it will relatively affect time and space complexity?
congrats buddy :)
Geez i have missed the the live!
I hope sir that you will be hitting 100k milestone till the end of the year and recieve silver play button
Thanks for the wonderful information you shared with us, I have a question, I have a Phd in petroleum geology, now learning data science on my own, do you think projects from kaggle would be good on my resume? Any suggestions on how to find some valuable projects on my resume? Thanks
I love the natural and realistic rhythm and pace of your videos and explanations, no flashy cinematics nor unnecessary distractions. Been watching your videos for a while now (with another gmail account ü§¶üèª) and they‚Äôre one of my favorites. Keep up the good work ü¶æ.
Saludos desde Buenos Aires!
Do you know the general acceptance rate for Masters in DS or Stats? I'm guessing 10-30%
V-log lmaooo
Congrats Ken! I am happy to be a part of the community. I am here from the times where the channel wasn't so popular, like it is Today :-P
I am looking forward for the movies about Kaggle :-)
Congratulations ma guy. Well deserved
I missed the live stream but I was wanted to ask as far as data analytics goes what mathematics is needed? For context, I have a degrees in mathematics and phsyics.
Sorry sir i was not able to watch this live beacuse i was out for playing cricket but I'm watching this now and next time i will watch your live during live streaming
Very excited for you on reaching the milestone of 50K half a year earlier than planned. Great value you are bringing to the community. Next step 100K and perhaps 200K by the end of the year üòÉüëçüëç
Great job!!
remember our bet...
Congrats on 50K, Ken! Your growth is insane but you definitely deserve it. Keep up the good work and hit 100K before this year ends! :P
Ken, could you please suggest me few good laptops for data science. Thanks in advance ‚ò∫
Sir when we build models or something else does it need to have a front end a well? Or just the model is fine for now? I'm in the last year of my college .
Congratulations on the 50k ken!!
Also I need a little bit of advice here, I'm trying to make a simple portfolio for myself and was wondering if you could suggest me a simple portfolio template (just like your own website).
what are some techniques to collect data other than web scraping, questionnaire and using API's?
Greetings from Mexico :)
I am interested to get my resume/CV reviewed Sir. Sending you a mail Sir!
Never knew there was a vendetta against pie charts in the Data Science community but now I do! 
Learning more and more from this series Ken!
Awesome review Ken! Nice example of a student profile!
Great Content as usual Ken Jee!!
Always good to see other people's portfolio!
best channel on youtube, keep it up!!
Awesome üôè
It is a great series I really loved it sir
Thanks for the great info
I am a Data Science and Statistics major and CS minor at NKU. I can graduate a year early if I switch to Stats major and minor is CS and Data Science. Should I do this and then pursue a masters in Data Science? I just finished my first year and I currently have a software release engineering internship and also have a ML internship from December!
Thanks for another great video, Ken! Like the new lighting setup üëçüëç
Thanks a lot for reviewing this! I'll definitely improve in the areas you mentioned and much more!

5:40 As a decent cuber I gotta ask,, do you know  F2L, OLL and PLL ?
For so long I anticipated my masters program in health data science with a focus on outcomes research, it's been a month and the python program is a huddle, maybe because I'm impatient, I get super frustrated when I run codes, and they don't go, I am quite smart, but I'm beginning to rethink this decision, I'm so confused, don't know what to do. I literally spent 9 hours on a task, and still didn't meet up with the deadline.
Great vid, thanks for sharing. I'm particularly thankful for believing and expressing that the capacity of humans to learn anything one step at a time with persistence.
Insightful. Thank you very much!
Hi Ken, It took me 1 year to learn to fully solve a rubix cube. For whole one year I was able to solve the 2 layers only, Finally I decided that I need to finish the cube and learn 3rd layer as well. Within a week I learned to whole cube. My personal best is 2 minutes 34 seconds now. But thats not the point. Point is now I am a hotel management student, with MBA in finance from Third tier institute, It is great deal in learning programming and stats , but that cube give me strength that I can. Sooner or later I will figure out everything and become expert. Thanks Ken Jee for inventing #66daysofdata to keep ourselves stick to the plan and get going.
Awesome... Simple very effective metaphor
Thanks a lot
couldn't agree anymore :)

I think that kind of mindset must be had for all kind of goals that we want to achieve, because some people usually blame the abstract way instead of choosing one and develop little by little
I hope your Rubik's analogy isn't *too* accurate. I never solved more than one side of that damn thing in the 80s and gave up. I hope that doesn't mean I'm lacking the perseverance/chops for data science üò¨
Hey K, You are correct sir.  My saying for the vast majority of 'life on earth' is "Small Victories". For instance, one rarely has *massive battles*, *huge upsets* and *gigantic victories*, instead we have many *Small Victories* that build to winning the battle.
Thank you.

Since learning that this field exists 6 months ago it's all I think about, and all I want to do. That being said, I have 0 technical background and am starting this journey at 40. Much harder for me to learn and retain at 40 than it was at 20. 

As much as I beat myself up for not getting it fast enough, I also try to celebrate the small wins too.

Stumbled onto your channel a few days ago and can't get enough. Thank you for this, and all the other videos. They really help.
Hi Ken! Does learning Computational Geometry help you in the field of Data Science?
Hey Ken jee, I hope you'll be able to help me with my thought: does venturing into data science naturally means degrading your eyesight since you'll be staring at the screen? What can be done about it? And especially of the programming and casual gaming aspect, because 
1) I hardly come across topics about eyesight when it comes to these 
2) Asian parents equate computer screen = bad XD
Thanks for taking time off in advance!
As with the previous videos enjoyed the transparency and the analogy itself! Thanks!
I see you too have Homo Deus there, another reason why I'm learning Data Science or technology in general hehe..
Thanks for this video üëçüèªüòÉ
Little steps are key!  One thing that I‚Äôve found to be super helpful in learning data science concepts is to read 3 google scholar articles on the topic at hand.  I did this for the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and I was surprised how I could start to understand the math after continued exposure. I still don‚Äôt have neural networks or naive Bayes methods down, but I hope I can do the same there.
Hey Ken, I recently graduated from university with a major in psychology and a double minor in computer science and mathematics. I struggled a lot with the learning environment of university, and unfortunately wasn't able to pursue a masters degree. Instead, I've taken a real interest in data science, more specifically machine learning, and have starting taking some courses online! I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later, which looks promising from the research I've done. My plan is extremely raw, but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind! I just wanted your advice and general thoughts on my situation. Thanks so much! Love the channel by the way, so happy I found you.
Thank you for sharing this is totally resonates to me, thank you :)
sir i learned 2 algorithms in python..is it enough for freshers to get a job.. apart i learned tableau and DBMS IN SQL
Ken Jee sir i am excited for your Q&A .What about coming live for it on YouTube
Ken Jee Sir , Your video is really useful. I know the concept of data science but don't know how to practice programming.please suggest something to how should I practice the python to get better in programming use it for DS and ML .
Awesome video! Which resources did you use for the maths ? :)
A great instructor who is putting out sincere content!
Ken sir you're absolutely correct.But remember when you got out of this hurdle and pass rubix or complete learning data science or anything you will get a great reward for it
Your are seriously underrated
Hey Ken, I had just finish all the modules in 365 data science except for the new BA module. I am revisiting ML and DL(Tensorflow2) as i guess these are the basics which i have to be solid in to progress. The risk credit is the most difficult and i had yet to fully understand it.  Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand. The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML. How should i advance? like learning more advanced ML and DL? Should i just go kaggle instead? or borrow books to enhance my skills? as i do not know how vast the world of ML and DL is. LOL. Thanks
Thanks Ken, I have already started to break bigger problem to smaller manageable ones. I hope will learn the skills soon
such an honest answer
@ken good lesson.  It's easy to get overwhelmed with the choices we have and stall your progress as a result.  One tutorial, one project at a time.  Keep up the good work!
this video is a good guide for a beginner like me! "start somewhere and usually doesn't matter where" sounds like gradient descending my ML knowledge lossüòÇüòÇ
great vid man, i also come from business background , and now struggling to learn DS and ML especially the math part. keep up the good job
I liked what you said about focusing on the individual steps without looking up too often - I look up to check my progress too frequently and end up feeling overwhelmed about how much is still left to learn. Thanks Ken!
hey ken jee, when are algorithms and data structures required in data science life cycle and when should you learn it when starting your learning process
Ken thank you so much for this video. All of the advice given are so valuable and I really needed to hear them. Thank you for all your amazing content.
This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey. Thank you for the wonderful content as always and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day üôÇ
Hola hola
Thank you so much for your content! I feel more confidence, drive, and motivation when I follow your advice.
A video of yours (where you mentioned accountability) popped up in my YouTube feed after I missed a week or 2 of online data science class üòÇ. This video gave me at least enough confidence to continue.Thanks alot (from the Philippines).
Hi. Thank you for this video. Myself I‚Äôm a undergrad majoring in  business information systems. I‚Äôve been trying watching videos on data science and etc. I‚Äôm still trying to navigate what I want to do in the future with my major. Also I‚Äôve been getting my certifications and areas in data science and cyber security too.
Amazing video...I also believe in divide and conquer approach...which always works
I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*.
When you go for one of the countless "become a data scientist in 10 hours" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone:
1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form.
2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks.
3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).

All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)
Thanks a lot, Ken. Can you please suggest some books to read, for Data Science. Thanks
Amazing as always, Ken! :)
you entered the field when data science was something only a handful of people could do. now, you need much greater expertise to enter the field, esp with the economy the way it is.
Wow Ken, it is amazing to see how much your channel has grown when you had a few hundred subscribers and now 50k! Keep up the good work!
Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about "selection", one of the key steps to learning.
In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms.¬†
Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages.¬†

How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. 
I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines. 

Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!
Thank You Ken. Your videos are really helping me to change my perception towards this new challenge. More power to you man!
Hello sir you're a sports analyst know i have one idea regarding duck worth Lewis method how i can contact you for sharing the idea plz reply sir
Hi Ken , this video appeared right exactly when I just gave up doing my Coursera course in math for data science, as I couldn't solve function approximation task . Seems like I am too dumb and don't have enough math background to be data scientist . Science I only can code, but when it comes to advanced math related problems, I feel depressed. Did you have the same feelings or it just me ? These advanced math related problems really scare me üòì didn't expect to face such problems where I don't even understand the task itself üòì
Hey been watch your channel for a while, great stuff...
Could we get an in-depth video on the differences between a Data Scientist and Data Engineer?
It would be really helpful.
Ken, I too was all over the place and felt like I wasn't going anywhere. So, a few months ago, I refocused and decided to learn SQL/NoSQL first. Just 2 weeks away from completing 8 certificates (just to give my learning journey some context), I estimate I'll be at an advanced intermediate level. My next "puzzle" will be math and statistics. Wish me luck going forward.
Another great video! <3
I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year. I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that. I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult. Just as you said, it takes a lot of time and patience, but with enough motivation and hard work, you eventually reach your goal. ^-^
Here's my plan

I'm good with computers, Python is sorted
1. Applied Data Science with Python on Coursera (got for free using university email)
2. Think Stats 
3. Business Essentials on Coursera (again free)
4. Kaggle

Hey, Ken. This is fantastic! Narrating your experiences in such a simple and easy way makes it quite encouraging for beginners. Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Iconic Ending Jee, simple but powerful ‚ô•Ô∏è
This channel is growing so fast, love it. Thank you for all the amazing videos !!
Hey! Your videos are always amazing. 

Can you make a video on the learning path for AI? 
I am a first year undergraduate in Computer Engineering and want to study AI, but I don't know the right sequence of approaching things. 
It would be very helpful of you if you could do it

RegardsüôÇ
Hey man, knowing that it's not that uncommon to struggle in these topics is quite relieving, thanks for sharing!
Thank you very much for making me realize I'm not the only one facing these hurdles.
This is a good analogy, Ken. Luckily I took relevant courses step by step over the years, so I only had to focus on certain things when learning DS. I can only imagine how daunting it would be to jump over a huge hurdle (or to climb up a huge mountain as you mentioned) in front of people who are just starting to learn.
I believe this video can guide people who are just about to learn data science in the right direction. 
It's important to take small steps at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once.
Hi Ken! Thank you for your video! To be honest I have literally watched almost all your videos and get excited when ever you post a video. Can you make another series on Data science projects like you did previously?  Thank you!
100% did not see that Rubix cube coming üòÇ
100k in the next 2 months Bet it......
Congratulations on 50k subscription... Eagerly waiting for next videos as well
Thumbs up to the rubiks cube analogy
Always giving the useful advice.
Wow I needed this after being overwhelmed yesterday. Thanks, man!
Thanks Ken for another awesome video. Just a moment ago I was about to find something to watch on YouTube and discovered your video in the recommended videos. Great analogy of mastering the rubiks cube and learning data science, particularly like the advice on breaking the learning to chunks and mastering each chunk. üòÉüëçüëç
Thanks for doing a Webinar with Krish Naik
Ken Jee, I am always waiting for your content :). I hope to create something as useful!!
Hello , Ken Jee would you recommend us to put data science projects that we did before the education background on our resume ?
Hi Ken. Your videos are very inspiring for a college student like me wanting to work in the data science field!! I have two questions about the portfolio:
1/ What is your expectation of an about-to-graduate college student to be like?
2/ Is it a good idea to include a blog (blog posts about your projects' journey, etc.) portion in the portfolio?
This was incredibly interesting - thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, Ken!
Thanks for the video. Great insights as usual, very informative! Also congrats to Pranav on his very unique portfolio website!
I sent you an email about a possible collaboration for your #ProjectReview series. Look forward to chatting with you more.
hands down probably the best portfolio video ever.
hey! i just started learning data science about 1 month ago. I followed your steps to learn, I've learned python basics by doing courses on udemy for python, also for matplotlib, numpy and pandas. I also learned abit of nlp because I will be doing it for my FYP. However, now after going on Kaggle and following your advice to read and understand the expert notebooks on Kaggle. I just feel so overwelmed by how much I do not know, I find myself googling almost every line. Is this feeling normal? Should I just keep going learning this way?
Komentarz dla statystyk :D ≈º√≥≈Çƒá
Hey Ken..will you make a video on github..its usage, application,storing files and stuffs...
Would you recommend using Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera for someone looking to get started with machine learning and data science?
Hi Ken, I am about to finish my PhD in applied physics. I would like to move to the financial market after graduating. All of my papers are focused on time series analysis from the brain with graph theory, removal of artifacts, and so on. Would you have some specific advice? Naturally, my portfolio is basically scientific papers, which is too academic.  Thank you so much
Hi Keen, am planning to update my laptop that is future proof for data science job, e.g running power bi, tableau, Alteryx etc etc what you recon the minimal requirement for that? Disk space, ram and processor etc etc
Hello sir

How one can avail internship for Data science?? Can you guide for that?
Clever bio on his Github,  nice example to refer back to as I'm learning more each day!
Sir I am an engineering drop out.
I want to focus on data science.
Some People tells that you must need graduation to become a data scientist.So what can I do , complete my graduation which takes 3 years or focus on a data science stuff ?
Please suggest me I am very confused.
Hey man thanks for your videos
Hey Ken! Love your videos (just starting to binge). I am starting my MS in compsci with specialization in ML. Do you think that this is better or on par with the MS in data analytics from the same university? Thanks
Thanks for these videos again Ken. I just finished making my website this weekend. One quick question: If I already have my website linked at the top of my resume, should the links to my projects go straight to its respective repository on Github or to its page on my website? Which would be best through the perspective of the hiring manager?
This series is really helping me a lot!
Thank you for making such amazing videos Ken.

hi i have one question I am from non technical background and want be business analyst so how a company is going  to look at my profile after getting necessary certification please reply
Thanks Ken Jee!! You have been inspiring many data science enthusiasts like me.
Already subscribed all of you guys. I can see your channel is growing rapidly right now. Keep posting great content man. Really appreciate your efforts!
Great
Thanks to all the panelist for sharing this valuable roadmap of DS. We all came to know how to head start and where to go now. Special gratitude to Ken for arranging this.
When I see your subscribers base growing ken, it feels like a personal growth too. Thanks for such an insightful panel discussion ;)
This is cool because you three were already are my go-to for data science tutorials, advice, and such.  Its like you already knew who I was subscribed to. I wonder if you can see who the common data science channels your viewers subscribe to for more interesting panel talks like these. It is also reassuring and exciting to see the upskilling journey I have ahead of me.
Thanks for creating this guys. I didn't know about Krish and the Data Professor. It's great to show such a diversity of backgrounds!
Thanks Krish Nike for introducing  Ken jee
Hey Ken, do you have any videos on data generation/simulation and augmentation?
This guy looks like Cody Ko and Noel Miller combined
Very awesome to hear all your perspectives on data science. Really happy that everyone is collaborating and very supportive.
Great to see U three on same platform .
Looking forward to get one end to end project by one from U all ...
I have been following Ken and Krish for a long time. So glad to see this collab. :)
At 20:46 .u made a great point Ken. ,Wish recruiters realize this thing.
this session was great ! Its good to see DS's collaborating and sharing der views from diff geography. Good Effort Man :)
I got so many answers from this thank you!
Usually, background music makes videos bad. But seriously your skill of applying background music is awesome which makes the watching experience really great.
Interesting video! I‚Äôm about to start college, and I was wondering if I could get a professional data scientist opinion on what to study. I am planning on majoring in Data Science, and I‚Äôm thinking of double majoring with a Psychology BS and maybe even a public policy minor. My goal is to work for the CIA/NSA in the future, but I also am still young and this might change. I also think working in politics as a data scientist would be very interesting and a rewarding career. This being said, I don‚Äôt want to restrict myself and would like to keep my options open. I‚Äôm very passionate about all three disciplines, but Data Science is my top priority. Thanks for the advice!
Krish Naik, Ken Jee and Data Professor are underrated and deserve more recognition than u know whoever is dominating the current programming domain on youtube(as a millionaire). Thanks alot for helping those who aspire to be a data scientist or similar
love krish sir
I'm following both Ken Jee sir and Krish Naik sir both are very helpful in data science .Thank you both of you for providing the guidence to the newer  data science students.
Thank you Ken Jee and Krish! @Data Professor very excited to subscribe to your channel!
Amazing colab ! Hope you start an interview series soon
Krish Naik is Love !!
Thanks a lot for this please create more these type of short discussions.
‚ù§Ô∏è from India.
oh wow!!!
I am follower from Egypt, I love your channels and most welcome to your great guest ..I recently begin in data science ..I need your advice and help to guide my steps how can I arrange it ?
Now I begin to study with IBM and later I get MBA degree is it useful for the study of data science..I have the passion but I just  confused  about the steps and the right way
Thanks for the helpful video
Thanks for this video, Kenjee. Thanks to you I also found Data Professor and Krish Naik. The three of you are awesome. You all have your own uniqueness and different qualities as Youtubers.
Sir background music was not necessary üòä
great content Ken! Greetings from Argentina
Can you give me some end to end project ideas, I am aware of that I need to gather data,clean data etc, but can you give me some project ideas, in the space of nlp and supervised learning problems. Is a Question answering bot of data science interview questions a good portfolio project?
what is the normal job profile of someone working in sports analytics domain?
I watch all 3 of you so this is great.
Probably this collaboration will lead to more collaboration and working with more people in the data science community..:)
I feel like I'm camping out in front of a store on Black Friday morning waiting for it to open so I can snag that amazing deal I've seen being advertised all week! üòÅ
Can't wait to see this video !!
How do u think an economist, can develop as a data scientist? Regards from Spain
Thanks for this initiative Ken..I am following you and DataProfessor for a longTime..You are both doing great to the community..I have one question to Ask..I am from Engineering Background, Learn Programing and DataScience Skills is not a big Task For me, But How to get Domain Knowledge as Domain Knowledge is very important as you say everytime..Actually I am intrested in Finance, Agriculture domain, How to get this Domain Knowledge..I know this question irrelevant to ask,But I want to have a clarity on this..Hope You will see this clarify..Thank you Kim, DataProfessor and Krish naik Sir...
Cant wait !!
my favorite data science channel!!!.....so eager for this...!!!
How to get a remote data science job?
Excited for this!!! üòÅ
@Ken Jee, Thanks for organizing this. It was a great discussion. You forgot your name in the video title!
I think many less skilled persons can take on most data science positions as long as they learn the powerful libraries available. So what's there for the specialists?
What's stupidity: the stupidity when you press dislike before you watching the video. Thanks for your effort guys and for those who pressed dislike go far away.
Looking forward to üí™

Ken this is another great and incredibly useful video!
Ken, which keyboard do you use ? Keep up the good work, many people have watched your videos down in Brazil. Good job on that.
Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man

I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer

There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective

I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such

Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music

But what i asked is much bigger than that

I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design

However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?

Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.

Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. 

Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. 

Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you
Excellent analysis as always, Ken!
Ken, I really enjoy seeing the Project Review episodes. Wondering if you saw my email which I sent to kenjee.ds@gmail. I sent it on 5/26 and it would be coming from royal sasan. Thanks again for this wonderful channel!!
Thanks Ken for reviewing my project, this will help me a lot.
Some wrote, that I'm not a beginner, but it¬¥s true. I started coding for the first time, with the beginning of the pandemic in March. I enjoyed it and also I had nothing else to do in the lockdown, so I invested whole days in learning Python/Data Science; Watched a lot of tutorials with 2.5x speed.
Ken¬¥s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, it¬¥s a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project can¬¥t be from a beginner. 
Also, I hope this motivates people, who are now at the beginning.
Hey, Ken, I‚Äôm a newbie in DS field and just getting started with my studying. Which online platform would u recommend to start from? What r ur thoughts on Dataquest?
Hey, Ken, I'm new to the data science, so I wanted to ask you a question. A lot of people say that the most important thing that data scientist should make is "value". However, I saw a lot of popular notebooks on Kaggle with complex algorithms but without any explanation of the reasoning behind them (e.g. doing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews but without mentioning why it might be beneficial).
So my question is "Is explaining the reasons behind your actions and mentioning the value of your work important?"
9:07 @datasciencejay 's video, How to Land a Data Science Job Without Experience (My New Grad Story!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v_Szio9r3E
Thanks Ken for another great video! Agreed, great analysis by Daniel and it's amazing that he can do this in just 3 months of coding.
Thanks For bringing up these kind of vidoes gives us the motivation to make Data Sciences projects even for a beginner like me.
Amazing analysis! Especially considering he only has 3 months of coding experience.
Such a great series to follow!  Getting to the point where I'll feel confident enough to submit a project soon!
this guy is a legend!
I dont think this guy is new to coding
Great video! Just sent you my time series analysis project, I hope you can review it!
Again, special thank you to the Data Professor for working with me to produce this video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q.

im having a hard time in ./hugo  server command, im having an error. it says that go.mod file cant find in exampleSite although that file is in exampleSite folder.
Its not working anymore
I was able to follow all the steps, however the Hugo theme didnt apply in my website. Can anyone here help me set up my website properly?
A bit confusing and not able to follow for me because my Hugo folder has the files in .html and not .md as in the video. When I manually them as .md, the page crashes. Any advice?
I think it is not working anymore. I followed the steps showed here and mine is showing a 404 error message when I deploy it from github.
Great topic but the video quality is terrible even at 1080p settings because of Data Professor. Its also hard to understand his English and video would've been much shorter if he knew what he was doing or he practiced for the video before hand. Thanks for the content anyway Ken!
Is there a way to bold all these texts at the top. like About, Contact, Projects the name. And also do the same for the project ttles once clicked in the ---

Hi Ken. I'm getting a 'binary with name "go" not found' problem. How do I resolve this
please help me, whenever i host the website locally it works perfectly however when i put the files onto github pages its a broken mess. its like half my website and half the default ananke, its literally broken, i don‚Äôt know what to do, i don‚Äôt understand why all of this is so confusing im just trying to make a goddamn website
What did he do at 5:30?  Is there a folder structure image that I can follow,  because this guy is confusing
Hi Ken Jee, great video. I tried this recently, but I am running into a problem. When saving my config.toml file, the local host site is not reloading as it should as explained at 11:40. My guess is that it has to do with the .hugo_build.lock file, but I am not sure.
this is not working for me.
Hi, I have done all the steps but I only get the website hosted with HTML only, no css or js functionality and frontend. I see that this guide was for 2 years ago, I would appreciate if somebody would enlighten about new changes and how I can take what I have done here and make this website work.
How to add/update new project
hey ken that was amazing and really helpful. can you please tell me how i can add a download resume option in my portfolio
Awesome Collab. Thanks both. This is much better than the previous tutorial.
Amazing content!! Thank you very much.
Fantastic work !!!
Really amazing content üòä
I keep getting this error after typing " hugo server":
Building sites ‚Ä¶ Built in 23 ms
Error: Error building site: "C:\Users\user\Desktop\OLD\MYPAGE\exampleSite\content\fr\contact.md:15:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "form-contact" not found
thank you for really helpful instructions.
though I meet 404 error after publishing it at github.
could there be somekind of policy change?
or I didn't follow instruction properly.
Anyone had any issues doing this with mac ? I can't figure out if it's because it should be different command with the shell or not. I would appreciate any kind of help
after deployement just the text is coming up in the website, the 'ananke' style is not visible .. can anyone help please?
2 years on and this video is still helping careers. Thank you Ken and Data Professor for the amazing work.  üôå
This was really a great tutorial! Thank you to both of you.
This is awesome! Thank you.
@Ken Jee  and @thedataprof Thanks for such an amazing video, very easy to follow. I was able to follow the walkthrough until the last step - where I got a 404 error. Did anyone get the same issues or find a solution?
Totally awesome! but a question though, to data professor,  the pictures served in {{< figure src="/images/**"  >}} are not showing up again after restarting the hugo server. Is there a fix anyone? It works the first time before you close the server.
This is so cool, thanks for that. One question though, once published if later I add a new project then do I need to generate all the files again and re-upload the whole content of the public folder, or is there a shortcut ?
i got an error where module not found after ./hugo server help!!
Thank you so much Ken Jee and Data professor. Because of this valuable content I was able to create my portfolio website
Thankyou so much for this !!!!!
Error: Error building site: TOCSS: failed to transform "ananke/css/main.css" (text/css). Check your Hugo installation; you need the extended version to build SCSS/SASS.  
Anyone faced this error???
Reply if you solved  it somehow.
Hello, I am very new to Github, powershell, hugo tools. 

I just tried following exactly as shown in the video,  but at 10:28 in the video, i have edited the config.toml file, i did that using the notepad. 
but after saving it and running the ./hugo server command, i am getting the following Error: Error building site: TOCSS:failed to transform "ananke/css/main.css"(text/css). Check your Hugo installations; you need the extended version to build SCSS/SASS

Please can you guide me on how to fix this?
Is it possible to add new things to the website after publishing?
I'm trying to resize the images, for some reason height=" " works but I'm not able to change the width. Any idea why?
Ken and Data Professor, thank you very much for this great tutorial! It is really useful for those who make their furst steps in creating portfolio. Just one question, is it possible to add a collapsible section in markdown for a large piece of text? Thank you!
Amazing tutorial!
Thank you very much!!
The changes I make in Atom are not getting reflected back in localhost. Can anyone please help? Thank you üòä
I have no words to thank you guys for this amazing tutorial. Thank you so much!
Amazing job! I built my portfolio in just one day, chapeau bas guys.
Wow , great work guys.
Hello Ken Jee
I had the same error as you with ./hugo server. To correct it, I did the same thing as you. But I keep getting the same error all the time. What to do?
sir, after  saving my work at atom it does not update it on Hugo, what should I do now ??
The only thing my portfolio is not doing is updating my image there
LITERALLY what I'm doing, and what I require!!
This Video right here  has been a game-changer for me
Hi, I am trying to follow this tutorial, but now the settings in github no longer say "master branch". I only see the choices "main" and "None"...
Thanks for the video but this is far too cumbersome and requires installing a lot of things that you don't necessarily need for anything else. Honestly, who would go this far just to create a portfolio page!

I liked your video where you created github page with markdown though.
Thanks again.
Hi thanks very much for sharing the tutorial. For some reason the code for adding an image to a post is not working. My image is in static/images/CA, {{< figure src="/images/CA.png" >}}
Can it be used on mac?
At 11:13 I'm not getting the website instead  I'm getting a Hugo tutorial to create a theme.
shift + right click for quick powershell in the directory :)
Thank you so much. It worked! :)
By far the best straight-forward, no nonsense, instructions for getting Pages up and running with Hugo. Thank you!
Hello, i am trying this template but i don't have Recent project in my main page. Do you know why? Thank you very much for all this information
Thank you for the clarity of the tutorial. it is fantastic. I have a question: where can one change the format of the text, for instance, justified, aligned to the right, position of the title over the photo, etc etc...isn¬¥t it a .css file to do that? Thank you very much
Can you please make another video on this, like once we make it live on github page, and now if i want to make some changes and update it on the page, how to do that. It will be a great help if you make a short video of it to help us to learn it. I am working on this portfolio now and love the work till now
Thank you Ken and Data Professor. This tutorial was very helpful.
This is what I was looking for to create a portfolio .
Thank you so much would love if you can make another video on portfolio üíØüíØ
Does anyone know how to resize the images? Like in the about section, I cannot change the image size using style or width properties of the figure tag? Perhaps there is a default set which is overriding it. I looked in the .css files although could not find it.
How can we add images side by side in horizontal manner. More specifically I want two images in single in my project.
Thanks for this awesome tutorial ! Just built my own portfolio website following the provided steps.
Can you also give us a walk-through video on how to provide a multi-lingual mode to this Ananke github page, please? There is no solid instruction video on how to make a github page support multi-lingual mode!!
after hosting on github its not looking as desired,images are not visible,I tried everything read all the comments i applied all the things which came to my mind but still the site is not looking like the theme please help @Ken Jee
-Hello, Ken, Thank you so much for your tutorial! Still, I have a problem, would you mind taking a quick loo? I can run my feature image while other images in the body do not work. Do you know what causes this problem?- After redo all the things, it works. And I don't know why, as I can set the feature image and static image using the same one. Please have a look at my portfolio,  https://alanspace.github.io/Alan_Portfolio_advanced/
Absolutely amazing! Thank you so much for this. I was easily able to replicate the steps.
Thank you so much, this is some amazing and really informative content that will surely help many :)
Thanks a lot you two for a great content
How can I put some code in the project writing? For example, in the project 1, what if I want to put some code to present a project as I walk people through it. Something like jupiter notebook or Rmarkdown
Cheers
is Hugo compatible to display jupyter notebooks with ipywidgets? and dynamic plots like the ones created with bokeh and seaborn?
An amazing tutorial !
Big Thanks :)
hello team, I've followed every step, redid the whole thing multiple times but the ananke theme doesn't seem to render. please help!
It's not working for me. Even after following all the steps in the video I'm getting 404 error while accessing the URL
Man, that was just amazing! Actually, the web site portfolio was killing some sleep nights and I had no clue on how to do it. Than, I landed on the first video, and now here. Really thanks for that! It was very well explained and hands-on walkthrough. Explendid job! Just subscribed and I'll be sure be following you! Thank you once again! Successs!
Please guide how to remove the share button in the website. Like the twitter and facebook icon does not even open.
Please guide me how to add a pdf file in the project please?
Hi Ken and Data Professor for this incredible walkthrough!
Everything went smoothly for me until the end, when i got 404 error page. 
Has anyone solved this issue?
I don't waste my 40 minutes here doing all along what DP's doing. Thanks KenJ and Data Professor.
Its showing error page not found
The master branche of Github pages doesn't appear on sources. what have I done wrong?
Hi Ken I need help here. When to choose a source, the master branche  didn't appear on my choices, only the main appeared. And so my website's link gave 404 error. Is there anywhere I cld have mistaken when the process? I need help here
I know that this video is kinda old but I have a question about how to insert latex (or any math rendering library) into the hugo markdown part of the site. Thanks :)
Hi @Ken Jee I tried to follow you step by step. Unfortunately I got error after getting the url from github. you can see the error by clicking the link.Can you please help me.      https://singhsaurabh0913.github.io/Saurabh_Portfolio/
Hello Data professor and Ken jee. I would like to say thank for your efforts.I have one question why he put link "https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfoloio_2/" instead of local http:// localhost:1313. we have to make local host to dynamic site. He put already exist website link in atom text editor.What about he crated local site , he did not use it.Can you explain or give solution why he used it.
This was such a brilliant walkthrough. I thought the basic github pages video before was good enough, but this produces quite a professionally finished product, in 45mins and FREE! So happy that you made this.

1 question: once you‚Äôve done an initial commit and the website is up, how do you then do a small update? Do you edit it locally again and upload the whole ‚Äúpublic‚Äù folder again to the GitHub repo? Or is there some more efficient way?
Where can I find the file "Public"?
When I create a local server with Hugo, I expected it to be running at localhost:1313/ but then it's created at localhost:1313/Portfolio instead. Does anyone know how to prevent it?
Note to self: come back here after I build some projects.
Thanks KenJee!
You Saved myife Thank Youuu Sir
The amount of help you are providing is immense! Please keep uploading these type of videos specially. Thank you so much.
How to use different Hugo theme ?? Like academia etc. I don't want to use anake theme. Awesome content! Subscribed!

sir how to get notification on email if some one is entering there details on your portfolio?
Hi , i wanted to ask that when I am opening this website on my mobile phone the images are not showing.
What's the reason behind this.
Any suggestions would be helpful.
Thanks a Lot for this tutorial.
followed ALL the steps to the Tee. I get a 404 error. Could you please help ?
@Data Professor @Ken My page is not appearing as expected, it is showing everything jumbled up after putting up on Github and changing the source. Please suggest.
Hi ken, just saw your video again. Can I host this site that you showed here...? to be more specific can i give domain names like : www.xyz.com
Amazing! Just one thing I want to improve: how can I set the text align to the left instead of the center?
Hi Ken Jee and Data Professor, thanks so much for this video. It's so helpful. I was able to add featured images to sections of my portfolio, but when I tried using  {{< figure src="/images/resume.jpg" title=resume"" >}} to add pictures of certifications and my resume, the images are not showing up. They only worked initially when I was hosting locally, but now, it doesn't work both locally and after hosting on github. I am temporarily using dropbox links to show them, but I'd appreciate if you could give suggestions on how to make it work. Thank you again!
ohhh
wooow, that's gonna be useful, thanks!
Hi Ken, 

Would it be possible to embed a neural nets chatbot into Hugo? 

Thanks
Thank you Ken and Data Professor! I've just published my first github data science portfolio website. https://hoooni.github.io/VincentPort/
Hi Ken, everything went very well till clicking on my website link created by GitHub . But as soon as I opened that link wishing to see my website, it shows 404, There isn't a GitHub pages site here. 
Could you please help me, I don't want to waste my hardwork .
How do I edit and add new projects to my existing portfolio made using this video?
@ken Jee @Data Professor.
What major scientist you are, I just wonder, I have question about my senior class,
Thankyou so much Sir !!!!
Thanks a lot, Ken!! I have a question for you. Could you please give me a tip on how I can add an HTML file in the post.md - working path and command example? Again, I always appreciate your help.
Please, how do you update the portfolio after it has been created?
So on 31st May I searched youtube for "Data science portfolio website" and found this awesome video posted just 2 days before! I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys!! Thank you!!
One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way:
After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages)
This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = "/images/.." 
To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. 
Change the "/images/.." to  "https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.." and the images will show
This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it. Hope this helps and hope you all make the website you want!
Thank you for this.. This is very helpful :)
Hi, congratulations for your channel!  I have problems when I upload my public file in github, it generates the web but without the ananke structure, could you know why?. Thanks!
words can describe . thanks ken
Hello Ken Jee, thank you for your effort to teach people in the data science journey. 

I personally give my appreciation to you, because your video is really helpful. Most YouTubers make me confused, but your video is very neatly arranged. I think we have the same persona, you are a people that always do everything in a structure and very careful. Therefore, it is comfortable with your video.

If there is any chance, I really want to be your apprentice in the data science journey.

Ken Jee posts a video on youtube
step1 : Like the video
step2: watch the video
Awesome stuff as always man!
My mac is not opening hugo.exe file because it says its from an unrecognised source. Can someone help me out here?
Congratulations for this partnership, you both are creating awesome content and helping a lot of people
This came at a perfect time. Only today I was trying to build a website from scratch and wanted to embed my work into it. Then I looked at website building platforms like weebly and jimdo...ughh. thanks loads!
This  was exactly what I was looking for and 32k subs so happy for you, you deserve it man! Keep it up!
Super like :) These demos are so useful and pragmatic.
Does this render Altair visualitions like fastai/fastpages? And what about Jupyter Notebook?
Hi, Ken is it better to learn JS, HTML and CSS to land a machine learning engineering job or is it a waste of time?
Hi Ken! Is it better to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript to land a machine learning engineering job or is it a waste o time ?
Is there any way I can show Kaggle on the main page near LinkedIn and Youtube channel. I tried pasting Kaggle URL but it is not showing on the website.
Always with a great content, Thanks man
Bro this is awesome! This is the type of content I've been trying to find. Your channel is so informational and practical please keep uploading!
Awesome vid!
Finally a collab between Ken and Data Professor! Great to see the two DS heroes working together to help this community!! Definitely following this tutorial.
Not even two minutes in and I already hit the like button. Found my extra project for the weekend!!  Thank you both!
Also, like Ken said The Data Professor has awesome videos on virtual internship opportunities that are FREE! Great opportunity especially for college students :)
Finally, thank you so much @Ken Jee. I was waiting for this. I have been working on making a portfolio website. The skeleton is ready. However I have yet to host it on github. I also have yet to upload my data science projects to github. When I do in about a month or so, would it be okay if you took a look at it and gave suggestions on one of your Monday episodes?
Is hugo better than Gatsby?
Again, special thank you to the Data Professor for working with me to produce this video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q.

Why did so many ppl dislike this? Going through projects step by step pointing out the nuance is helping me A LOT
Wooow- just diving into this video but what a great series idea. (Endless content created by others, who are willing participants) 

the coding virus has spread and isn‚Äôt stopping‚Äî as more people dive in; videos in this series and your channel by extension, will explode

All of this is miles above my head but I‚Äôm slowly getting it
Hi @Ken Jee, thank you so much for your videos, it helps me a lot to navigate what I need to do to improve my portfolio. 
Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this? I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium.com and code on Github. Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium.com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience. Plus, Medium.com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis. Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github?
Looking to hearing from you soon

Hi! I am not sure what the project was about after doing EDA.  Did he try to predict the actual true gdp by using only the most relevant features in the data, like the number of phones etc? Sorry if this is a dumb question.
Hi, Ken, is it better to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS to be a machine learning engineer or is it a waste of time?
Hi Ken! Im currently working on my first regression analysis (first concrete data science project really), but I‚Äôm being pretty thorough. Would you like to review it? It‚Äôs an assessment for my stats class, but most of what I do is not required since we have more concrete data science classes next year. It is due in Sunday, so if you are interested I can provide it for you. Just keep in mind it‚Äôs a first for me :)
Awesome, as always! I found this one particularly interesting, because it was well documented and went rather in depth. It shows that you can always do something to spice up your projects. On a different note, how many hours do you actually work to create one video? It is really incredible how you've kept up with consistent uploads for over a year and I am just curious about how much time this takes for you.
Thanks ken:) your videos are just great, l'm planning to become a data analytic, any recommendations for specific channels and courses please ,, cause I just feel I'm lost.
so I just started learning about data science, your videos help me a lot to get the insights. Thanks for those, and I had a question that would you recommend me to do the IBM Specialization on data science as a beginner?
Is this possible to apply a custom loss function in a regression model ? I'm working on a stock market prediction model and I need to maximize the following loss function: if [predicted] < [actual]  then [predicted] else [-actual]. Would that be possible ? Thanks
Hey Ken i got an idea for a project to work on my own (i posted it on the comment section of the video prior to that one, but just in case you only check comments of your most recent video), can i send an elaborated version of my idea via email so you can have a quick look and give me a little bit of insight ?
Thanks
Loved the part where you mentioned how him including small personal details on his GitHub such as how he likes Chess can have such an influential factor on people looking at his profile! 
Will definitely reference this video again in the future :)
do you read research paper's as part of your job?
can you make a video on how to scrape a lazy loading website?
Hi 
Your videos are really helpful. But I‚Äôm unable to find the correct order to watch them. Can you help here?
If you use jupyter-lab there is an extension to spell check your markdown cells. It is quite useful.
As an MBA graduate can i pursue a career in data science?
Hi Ken, great video. I‚Äôm going to be getting my masters in business analytics starting in the fall and am trying to work on some projects this summer to get some more experience. My goal is to work as a data analyst for a couple of years and then transition into data science. Your channel is very informative for understanding this field and how to leverage Kaggle and github because my current experience level is just MIS/analytics undergrad and internships. It‚Äôs really helpful to hear about these topics from someone with experience that isn‚Äôt a professor. Keep up the great work!
Ken Jee your content is awesome! I feel you really did a great job covering some of the important aspects. I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for some time and what really helped me get a lot of interviews was my research experience in ML  and DS.
Hi Ken, can you talk about how to manage and overcome conflicts when working with a team of programmers? It would be very helpful to get your input on this topic. Thanks!
Will you review my project? I haven't started but I would definitely would want to get reviewed for feedback.
Hi Ken, I've been doing a data science bootcamp in London with Flatiron School. This week is my final week, and I have just finished my final capstone project. I plan on applying for data science jobs very soon, and I am trying to sort out my github projects, so I can impress recruiters and companies I apply to. I plan on changing my older projects to be structured and detailed like my capstone project, and do the same for any new projects. Could you review my capstone project please? This is the github link to my capstone project: https://github.com/awesomeahi95/Hotel_Review_NLP .
Thanks, been loving your videos, very helpful!
I am new to data science and this series is helping a lot  in how to structure my projects .keep going
you are on fire ken , keep em coming . also it would be kinda nice to start an interview questions series
Hi Ken, I am a freshman studying a bachelor in statistics.  Would you review projects in R?
Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).
I'm tying to get better at explaining and documenting my work so this is a great example for future reference! Thank you for sharing it!
Thanks for watching everyone! Definitely check out the data professor's channel as well! More great visuals of his can be located here: https://github.com/dataprofessor/infographic/blob/master/06-Different-Data-Science-Roles-Explained.JPG
Excellent resource for understanding where each role fits in.  You're right that there is a lot of flexibility in roles (fair amount of overlap) and I'm sure it is expected that the smaller an area that one role focuses on, the more specialized they will be in that role.
Hey Ken, that's an awesome explanation. Thank you.
May I ask where does a BI Analyst fit into this? Thanks again.
loved the video!! you should smile more!
The dog when ya talking about the MLE interacting with the rest fucking killed me, ty for the videos man
Finally found this video on your channel. I wanted to know about the differences. Thanks ken!
Thank you for sharing.
Thanks
In most videos I‚Äôve watched, people say that you can‚Äôt start as a Data Analyst and later on become a Data Scientist. Plus, it was often mentioned that in order to be a Data Scientist, you need to have a Bachelors degree in the field. What do you think about that? I‚Äôd love to know! Thank you :)
Thanks Ken.... I just started my new job and this will definitely help me to direct myself in a proper direction.....‚úåÔ∏è
First of all thx for sharing your knowledge On question, 
Which is better to deploy a model in your opinion(flask or django)
Which is easier to deploy (flask,django)
2:20 i,m newbie to data field,but i dont think data cleaning is in responsibility of data engineer of course it,s vary from company to company but it,s not a part of data engineer job
Data engineer mostly focus on data warhousing,data pipeline,etl &... if i am wrong i dont mind if you tell me
I‚Äôve been kind of afraid to ask this question, but what do you think is the major difference between a data scientist and statistician? Sometimes the line gets very thin between the two
Perfect, easy, short and explanatory.
Thank You
I have a business role in Operations / Planning, but all my major accomplishments were related to collecting, treating and analyzing data in Excel and Power BI. I am currently learning Python, R and statistics to do it more professionally, and in the future I would like to be able to do predictions/ML to bring even more value to the business. I fear that strict data roles may get me too far from the business routine, what could be a problem as I do enjoy living in the supply chain area. I am not sure if being a Data Scientist is my ultimate goal, but I also don't know which roles would be more aligned to my objectives. How do you think Data Analyst/Data Science roles would blend with more business roles?
It will be great if you use slides

Would you say that someone should start as an analyst, move into engineer and then scientist?
Love this series üëçüëç
2:38 'extract transform blowjobs'
How hard is it to understand "we take your information & sell it to advertisers while giving it to the DNC for free" the end
So I'm trying to be a data scientist eventually,and I know from experience I don't like software engineering but I do really enjoy the role I had as a data analyst intern.Would you say looking for a job as a data analust is a good way to gzt your foot in the door to work up to data scientist eventually? I also can't afford to do an advanced degree.
I have to be an expert in python, for data analyst?
Loved how you switched up the introduction of the video!
Your getting better with each upload Ken!
Great info! love how you broke this down!
Hey Ken, enjoyed your vlog. I am looking into vlogging myself, just curious it looks like you are reading a tele-prompter - is that the case?
Hello sir I know this question is coming out from no where, but I feel you are the right person to ask the question so I'm asking
how to select best 'Categorical features' in classification problem? is there any way to find which categorical feature is contributing more in terms of predicting?
:) Thanks for the video
It is possible freelance on data analysis and data science?
Hey Ken, great video as always. Just a small question, im currently an industrial engineering student (so i have a good background in statistics) and have enrolled in the EDX IBM data science certificate program. I have finished all the courses (excpet for the SQL one which i will start soon) and feel like im fine with the coding and concepts (regressions, clustering, classification, etc. ) but do not know where to go from here since i have only worked on 1 project (the capstone from the course). As a next step i am thinking of learning tableau (for data visualization) and SQL, but apart from that what do you suggest i do ?
Thanks
Good stuff, man. I'm interning as a Data Engineer this summer, and was also one last summer(i actually really enjoyed it). Mainly focused on ETL's and automation using Python and AWS... Do you have any tips on resources where I can better my SQL knowledge?
It takes how much time to become a data scientist?
I really appreciate your content Ken. I have a question and will appreciate an answer from anyone .My background is in Petroleum Engineering and want to switch towards Data Scientist there is an online boot camp of 3 months from brainstation( 15000 $cad) to help me become a data scientist. Do you think it's worth it? Once you are a Data Scientist is it easy to transit to data engineer?
Thanks for this video. I reminded me of this book "Making sense of Data" by Glenn J. Myatt and Wayne P. Johnson 
It's focused mostly on the first four parts from what I saw.
What are your thoughts on engineers (chemical) transitioning to a career in CompSci specifically in Data Science?
hey, you said before you work with 365. is there an affliction code for me to use?
Thanks for clarification!
Thank you for the break of each role! Now I know what to expect when I apply for internships in the Data Field later down the road :'))
Really good and clear eplanation
I am currently taking a Data science  cousre and I'm at regression ,suggest something for me to sharpen my skills.üòù
Do I need to learn Data Collection, cleaning and EDA before moving to build ML models? Or can I directly start with ML and build models?
Thanks Keen for clear descriptions. Looking for more  useful videos further :))
What's the difference between someone with a masters or PHD in Math who is a data scientist and someone that doesn't have a math background and is calling themselves a Data Scientist because of their experience in the field and some of the classes they have taken in data science?
Nicely broken down!! As someone who just landed in this industry, it was very interesting! 
Like the visualizations and the new style as well!!
Thank you again for this video, Ken. We can say that I already work as a data analyst, however my tools are restricted to BI and excel. It turns out that I have the business core, lacking programming and math skills. Your videos have been helping me to create a plan in this process to become a data cientist. thank again bro
23k subscribers! You are really blowing up. Not long ago you were under 3k, then 10k, then wow! It's great to see you are growing. Keep up the great content.
Great explanation!
Wow!
This video was definitely an up in production. It is really awesome to see you smile when you discuss your favourite topics in DS or f.e. when you did the intro, it really shows that you're passionate about what you do and you enjoy making videos. The nice graphics were a great addition to your video, especially since they really fit well with a topic like this one - showing what role is located where in the project lifecycle. I'm excited to se what you come up with next! :D
Hi Ken thanks for making this video. I found this very helpful. 
I have a question. As I am in my senior year of computer science student, I am not sure whether I should go further into master. Especially, when I look up the job openings, all data scientists are usually required to hold at least a master degree. Is it necessary for a data scientist or relatable positions as you mentioned in this video to have a master or even Ph.D in Data Science field? 
Thanks and please keep continuing to make this kind of video!
Fly high G
Thank you Ken, because of your video, im into Data Science world. currently I work as a Data Analyst for about 7 months now. I still find it hard sometimes to learn Data Engineer and DS part. Is it better for me to learn DS part or DE part first? thank you
Your video help me so much! Thank you!!
Nice content, friend!
Great content Ken! Do you know ir there‚Äôs any DA or DS internship on FANG companies? I could only found a research intern position, and I‚Äôm not sure it is trully related to DS.
I would really appreciate if you could put out your advanced portfolio tutorial video soon. Thanks a lot.
Great info!  I'm definitely in the "starting as a data analyst and progressing to be a data scientist" boat.
Between EDA and  ‚Äúmodel building‚Äù, where would you include feature engineering, feature selection , model validation? I ask because I have sadly seen MLE job postings where there is zero ‚Äúmodeling‚Äù work. I often find myself in this very situation at my current job where I merely productionize models created by more senior data scientists. So yea I wonder how you think about the different interpretations of these roles in the industry =) .
Awesome break down. I noticed that a majority of my time I spend on projects or learning is just cleaning data and exploratory analysis.
Hi, Ken. I‚Äôm quite shy to tell this to you because this is off topic. But it will be appreciated if you check out some of my cover songs on my channel. And great content as always! :)
Great video! I'm trying to start out as a data analyst as well
Me causally watching Stefan Mischook video with Will Smith in the background.

 ! ! ! Ken Jee comes up with a question ! ! !
Short and sweet
Have you Japanese roots? Your name+surname= kanji XD
Dear sir,
I'm from Electronics background and I want to be Data Scientist, so I'm going for Masters of Data science please suggest were to start from..so I can have great knowledge about Data science and be a good Data Scientist.
Another great video as always.
Thanks.
Really clear description!
Until now i have found the model deployment step really tiring and complex.
Is it necessary to master if i want to become a ML Engineer?
Another great video!
You can study Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in my university as a Bachelor and Master - would you consider that a valid option - as Artificial Intelligence seems to be more needed for someone with a PhD, would you therefore recommend starting with studying raw Data Science, Data Engineering or even Machine Learning for a Master?
Kind regards~
I hope to become a data scientist just like u
I really like the fact that the description is basically a transcript!
Sometimes you just can't watch the entire thing, and it really helps,
This definitely cuts into Ken's watch time, awesome selflessness mate, Thank you
Love your videos! Keep up the good work!
Thanks for watching everyone! If you would like to have your project reviewed, please comment below and send an email with your info to kenjee.ds@gmail.com! For more resume and project portfolio advice, please check out this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM1eE_Coh6g&list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek
I noticed the books that you had on your desk.  What are your thoughts on Mathletics and Thinking in Bets? I can also wait for a video book review. I don't mind using your affiliate links. üòâ
Can you review my Portfolio? I have only 2 projects. https://www.youtube.com/user/rodfloripa10
I wanted to make a data science portofolio, can you give me project 
ideas on how to approach it? I am not getting ideas as to how to go 
about making an end to end machine learning project.
hey! I sent you an email requesting to have my resume reviewed. thanks
Great video Ken! I like how you focused on the findings and not just the model! It's something that people don't talk about but we need to give it more focus! Keep up the great work!
good review! I think this shows once again that documentation is really crucial. In the end it does not matter how many incredible projects someone made, if they can't showcase and explain them clearly, even if this sounds harsh. This really motivates me to improve my own resume, I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed, and that takes up some time as well :D
I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much. For smaller companies though there can of course be differences.
Question- Is django used in the field of data science, if yes have you used it in any projects?
Hi Ken,
I love your videos, they've been incredibly helpful. I'm an economics major with an actuarial science minor and am teaching myself Python and SQL through DataCamp right now (I already have a fair amount of experience with R). I am also doing a data science internship this summer. I know this may make it seem like I am pretty set but I am also graduating this fall and am pretty scared about my job prospects. Do you have any advice for more I could be doing to try to get into the field?
Great Video !!!!!!!
Question :- I watched andrew ng machine learning course on coursera but he taught everything on Octave . I know basic things about machine learning but nothing about phython . Could you recommend me a course just for python for machine learning
This is really helpful, Ken! Please do more of these!
Hey Ken, I appreciate that you put a small summary in the description!
This is supper awesome. Keep going brother. I will keep following you. Cool content.
My first time on this Series and I think I will love it.
Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player. Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions, but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs.
Hi Ken. Good review. Can you help us know what are the books available online on data science? I learn better when I read.
Which language according to you is more beneficial to learn for Data Science,Ken. R or Python? Currently I'm taking Data Science using R. So, should I focus on Python as well? And can you please suggest some good courses? Thank You.
Great video! Helps me with my own projects. Can you make a video on connecting your own data.
Thanks Ken for another quality video! Great insights from the recruiter's point of view üòÉ
Thank you for your valuable advice!!
Great recommendations! üëå
Would love if you reviewed my project too ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Lovely content, Ken. Keep them coming. Eagerly looking forward to your extended video on How to make a Github portfolio! Thanks <3
I hope that this video helps you to build out a practical data science portfolio! More advanced version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8 ! 
Written tutorial for those who prefer a different format: https://towardsdatascience.com/9-minutes-to-a-data-science-portfolio-website-80b79ced6c54
nice video
as an github beginner, I cant follow.
This is probably a stupid question, but I have never used github or github pages before, but from watching this video I am assuming, do we need to first upload all our projects to github repo before putting them on github pages?
Hello Ken Jee! Do you think this video is still relevant for 2023 and that this is still the best way for a data science / data analytics portfolio to show to employers? Or is there a more 'state-of-the-art' method  today that people use to make their portfolios?

I'm about to begin my journey to learn data analytics from next month and I wish to record my learning process (what I learn every week) and organize my future projects somewhere to show to employers, and I'm wondering if this is still the best method that exists out there.
Great video with total information
Thanks for sharing, Ken!!!
It will be very useful.
Thank you Ken. Its really helpful !
Hey ken!!! i can't find github pages in the repository settings.
what can I do???
Hey Ken I haven't watched the video hht I want to ask can we use this strategy for Data Analytics/Analysis?
Is there a way to make the links in the page open on a new tab instead of the same tab?
Hello,
This is a late comment but I was wondering if someone has the same issue.
I followed the same steps to add images to my portfolio, but they are not being updated.
They show on the actual github page, but it does not show on my html link (12 hours have passed)
Any idea why this is happening?

Thank you!
content is ok. poorly done editing imo
Thanks for the simple and effortless walkthrough, it's simply very helpful üëç
Thanks
Thank you for this video, a useful and great explanation. saved it to my playlist!
Thanks Ken. Really liked this video.

A question: Is it possible to create the same github page but with HTML and CSS?
Hi Ken, Great video but I just started my Github page and I need to add my first project. Do you have a tutorial on how to do that and how to use Github? Once I get my first project added, I can then revisit this video.  Thank you!
This is truly useful.
Why master branch?
You help me so much. Thank you!
Thank you for this video, Ken. I AM going to do this!!
Omg a lot of thanks for u‚ô•‚ô•
Very useful recommendations, thank you Ken
I cannot connect to the master branch! can anyone help me
Thank you Ken, found this video today and created my portfolio, tremendous help!
Ken, thanks for the video. It was right on time.
Thanks, very useful
hi, professor. I was wondering if you can create another video or give a quick answer on how to embed google analytics code into your website. I am debating should I modify the code in index.html (in the public folder). I hope you can help me with this question. I would really appreciate it.
I had no idea about Github pages and have ZERO desire to learn wordpress.  I was going to say F-It and get a wix site.  Bahaha.  Now I'll have something more respectable for potential employers.  Thanks!!!
Thank you Ken Jee!!
Thank you so much
Hey Ken! I have question regarding a portfolio website. Is it bad if "stole" my portfolio website github page from someone else. I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it. 

But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol. Curious to hear your insight on these concerns/thoughts I've had when it comes to making a portfolio website
Hey, Ken! Would it be alright if I just put links to my Kaggle notebooks in my GitHub portfolio or are there some important benefits from basically copying into GitHub repos?
Thank you ..

Nice work üëç
I think I messed up the order:
- Setup portfolio page & showcase projects ‚úîÔ∏è
- Work on projects to showcase -> Coming soon!
Thank you Ken Jee for this amazing content! Now a days it becomes my habit to watch your channel and more I watch your contents, I learn something new and that's how you became my inspiration. I am a M.Sc. Operational Research student and I need some career advise/ guide in the field of Data Science. Should I ask my doubts here or is there any way to ask them? Please let me know.
Thanks for these amazing contents again :)
really Thank you, please keep consentrating  your content for beginners and fresher. Your exlanation really helpful, cant find it anywhere
Very helpful video.  Straightforward and very-informative. Thanks for making this.
Been loving the content!  Excited to see the "advanced" website vid.
I came across your channel and I cannot stop watching your contents. I am planning to transform my career to be a data scientist. Thanks :)
Hi Ken! Thanks for making the video. I found it very useful as I immediately started to build my own while watching your video. 

I have a request for the upcoming videos or if you have made one, let me know as well. I would like to know what should we post in a project repository.  While portfolio is more like about the summary of all projects, I want to know what good repository can describe the project clearly and meaningful. 

Thanks Ken and as always all the best for your Youtube channel!
Ï¢ãÏäµÎãàday
This is so good.. thank you so much!
Ok I really wish 3:50 was explained more...what are you doing here excatly? This seems to be right where I start  getting confused.
I‚Äôm so glad I stumbled on your channel! I‚Äôm a data science student right now and I love how detailed your videos are. I‚Äôm starting a data science/ statistics channel soon and excited to be one of the few women, POC data science channels on YouTube :) would love to possibly chat with you either through a video collab or a call. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested! Always looking to learn more within the data science community
All of ur videos are really helpful and educational.
Hope your channel grow real fast
Very informative and straightforward. Thank you.
I want to scrap data from real estate provider's but the robots.txt is disallowing every field how do I go about with end to end considering that web scraping is the first part of end to end.
Hey Ken, I'm actually building my data portfolio but I'm a little lost on what to show. I've done a lot of work with R and python projects, analyzing data but I'm not sure if I should show every work/project that I've done over the last 2-3 years. What do you recommend?
This is perfect timing for me. I just graduated and I'm starting to apply for full time positions.
Thanks Ken! Looking forward to the advanced video!
Hi, Ken. You became my one of the mentors. Thanks for the resources. 

And I request, Could you do video Data preprocessing vs EDA. Like what should come under which. Hope you will... !
Would you recommend doing the deep learning courses by deeplearning.ai on Coursera? 
Really would like to know your thoughts..
I really like Github Pages and I've used it to setup my own personal website as well.
The great thing is that you can also just buy a cheap domain and let it redirect to your Github-Page,
so you do not even need to buy a certificate to enable HTTPS.
It really is just the flatout easiest way to build a good looking personal portfolio!
Thank you so much for this, KJ!
Wow ken this is awesome. I have worked on 5 or so projects so hopefully that's enough to land a job. Didn't realize how quick you can create a portfolio like this. Cheers. Have to work on this when i finish my next project.
How much money do you make? This is very interesting topic you should talk about
Thanks Ken, intro music is superb!
You are growing very fast. I was your 8k sub, and you are 10k ahead already! You deserve more! Thanks for all your info!
I watched all 4 previous videos but I just noticed a new intro haha but it looks really good
Ken Man, Really thank you for this video.! It was really a helpful one.
These are the kind of videos that we need as a lot of people are still trying to make sense of the field, especially non techies. Do continue the series with respect to where we can find quality data sets and how we can take one firm footed step at a time.
Thanks a lot for this video!
You have wonderful content. I've noticed that your subs have been growing pretty rapidly over the last days, congrats! With regards to Kaggle, a professor once told me "if a product is free, you're the product". How might this be the case with Kaggle? Why is the platform free?
Man, you are best of the best.
Awesome stuff! Really excited to see the advanced version :D
This is so cool!
You just got subscribed, keep up the good work
Awesome Ken! Looking forward to the  next one!!
Delivered as promised Ken.... thanks again for as alway the "Amazing videos "...üëç
Thank you :) was wondering how to do this
That was really fascinating, always thought I need to do a lot of work for building my portfolio. Thanks Ken, great job.
Saw your project on 365data science. Every time you come up with something great. Thanks!
Hey Ken! Amazing video. I'm sure your channel is going to grow a lot
Very interesting and informative video, Ken. Thank you! I was considering to make a few ‚Äúexploration‚Äù notebooks. For example, a notebook trying to cover the difference between classification algorithms, with some hyper parameters tuning and trying to figure out the best metrics to use. This isn‚Äôt exactly a very original project, but I think it‚Äôll contribute a lot for my learning process. Do you think this would be a good candidate to go for my portfolio? Thanks again!
It's like you read my mind ü§Ø. I was looking for this yesterday
I really appreciate what you are doing. I look forward to your future videos
Amazing üëå.. it saved so much tedious work and efforts. Thanks for sharing.. looking forward to see the advanced version ‚ò∫
I never knew the github can do that. Thank you ken for that üëç
Super helpful video as usual Ken! I just happened to be starting a GitHub profile and doing my first project so this came at the perfect time
Very straightforward!! Added to my to-do list. Excited to see the advanced version!
damn. needed this.
Great and concise video on getting a portfolio website up and running in no time üòÉ
Thank you sir...
Love from India ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you so much u r the best ‚ù§
Finally you made a video on this! I had been searching for this for a while. Eagerly waiting for the advance part!
If you have some time do check this out :)

Hi! Ken, Really very helpful video keep on going and make awesome videos which are useful for data science enthusiasts

Thank you
Thank you Ken, It will certainly come in handy to me, in the near future.
good luck, quality contents
Jekyll is a great way to set up a static website on Github pages.
Hey Ken ! I just completed a course on inferential statistics... great course... but I don‚Äôt know where and how to apply the knowledge I have gained. Can you help me out please?
Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video, I am a 3rd year engineering student from India, and planning to go ms in data science in USA after 4th year. 
1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain. 
2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
(2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.
Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting.
Thanx and sorry for such long question
Again, I am so grateful for everyone who has supported this channel. I look forward to being a part of your data science journey going forward!
50,000 subs since you posted! that's amazing, can't wait to see your channel grow more!!
Congratulations. Not too long ago when I subscribed to your channel after watching the NBA simulation video I think you had something like a few thousand subscribers. Now you're at 50,000+; a testament to the quality of content you're putting out. Keep em coming.
wow, you were just 10k a few weeks ago and now you are 30k! congrats
congrats ken
Hi Ken, I do recall when I couldn't find any guidance about how to initiate a DS project and what all steps needs to be carried for a complete DS project with git hub repo, your DS project from scratch proved a life saviour for me. I loved that series so much that I completed that in a single stretch. Thank you so much for making DS videos and helping us to understand the concepts behind it.

I can say that you are a North star for aspiring Data Science professional like me. Wish you to cross 10 million subscribers shortly. Thanks

Vinay
ahh you upload so many great videos so quickly I can't keep up with commenting :D
I'll stick to it though because I really want to support your channel!
As I've said multiple times already, you are really a great inspiration to me
and I genuinely enjoy watching your videos.
I just saw your video on 365 DS's channel and I must say that was really great! :D
Your expertise combined with the very flavorful animation style of 365 was really
fun to watch. It's just incredibly how you tripled your audience in a matter of days,
all the best wishes to you! :)
I'm hoping to see similar improvements in data science as you've had in YouTube! Keep up the great work :)
it's beautiful how you are thankful for us but actually, we are happier and more thankful for you truly :) , you educated and inspired me and led me to great resources, also thank you because your work is not just useful but also beautiful and well made.
can't wait to reach my 5th not bad project and 10th nice project and 15th amazing project and look back at the journey, a journey full of learning and growing and amazing experiences.
I am a new subscriber , On your milestone for 100th video . Your video are really good related to data science . I have watched a few videos today I really love it . Thanks you for this really amazing video that helped me learn new concepts Today .
Thanks for all the helpful videos man! I may be an Information Technology and Business student, but nothing is going to stop me from exploring Data Science and slowly climbing my way up to be like you one day man üëä
Congrats ken... I have a question for you...
How to do feature selection on imbalanced data? do we need to do with original data (imbalanced) or with oversampled data (SMOTE) ?? Which is better??
Congratulations! Your videos have been very helpful and also what is your opinion about 365 DataScience course??
Sir Your Content is great but it is not reachable to everyone who want this.Thats why your channel has 15000 subscribers If you try to reach more and more people then million subscribers are not so far.
Congratulations! There is not many informative channels out there and I'd say I'm lucky to find yours, given that YouTube algorithm is not too friendly to smaller YouTubers.
Video Idea: How do you analyze your own Youtube channel data?

Congratulations Ken! Next stop 100K Subscribers!
Is It better to learn machine learning in python because I learnt it in Octave .  Great VIDEO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Thank you too!
Please don't be like other YouTubers who stop replying to most of the comments. Viewers invest their valuable time on your videos for learning from you. Therefore, please try your level best to reply to all of their comments.
Take care and keep the good work.
Hey Ken Congrats. Today I was applying to data analyst roles and I remember you saying that these are great roles for people who want to pursue data science but aren't quite there yet. I think you said that... Anyway  I was wondering if you had any tips on pursuing these roles? 


And in honor of your 10,000 subscriber and 100th video, I just like to say that I took an online SQL course and somewhere I discovered your SQL Lahman's Baseball tutorial and it was great as a supplement. That's how I found your channel. Keep up the good work!
Just found your channel a few days ago, and I think I have finally realized what route I want to take with my CS degree - Thanks, sincerely a computer science student
Congrats Ken! Keep crushing it!
Great Ken!

Congratulations!  I look forward to someday talking to you. You inspired me as we both are from similar background (economics). I am about to start on this DS journey as I am wrapping up my PhD. Thank you!
Congrats! üéâ
Just found out about your channel, your videos are really informative and I like your way of teaching. c: I hope you grow and do more videos; I just started studying data science 3/4 months ago, and your videos really help me stay and keep motivated! Thanks!
Also if it's okay that I ask about books I can read for the statistics and any great reads that you find really helpful.
This is such a nice channel! Great job!
Ken you deserve it.. You make high quality content...I just want one guidance..Till now I completed learning python,pandas,Numpy,Data visualization..I didn't started learning any Machine learning algorithm..As you always said Learn by doing Projects,So with this knowledge can I start doing Projects..Please clarify this.. Thank you
Congrats Ken!
I‚Äôm a recent grad in the job search. I‚Äôm glad to see this content! Keeps me motivated, and shows me areas to improve in. Truly thank you!
Excellent work Ken, really meaningful... It is changing the live of many junior data scientists and improving our carrers and hence our lives... Congratulations and keep  inspiring data science community ‚≠ê‚≠êüåüüåüüå†
Can you please upload a playlist on retraining a deployed model and handling multiple user requests at once ? an extension to your deployment video would be heavenly.
Weldone Ken! Your videos are very informative! Congratulations.
Congrats on both :)
quality content at its best! hope you grow exponentially
the best way to learn is thru teaching. I really like these vids
Good job Ken! That was fast :) If I remember correctly you had 8k subscribers before 2 weeks? Road to 100k :)
amazing
Have you done any sport analytics videos?
Started from the bottom. Now you are here. Congrats man!
Congratulations Ken on this great milestone! Really enjoyed watching your videos! Thank you for bring great value to the Data Science community üëç
12th viewer, 1 like. Already subscribed. Keep up Ken.
Congratulations! You're amazing Ken. Keep up the good work.
Special thanks to Raisham for letting me review his portfolio! I want to also apologize to him for constantly mispronouncing his name (actually pronounced Ray-shim)!  If you would like me to review your resume, projects, or portfolio, please let me know in the comments below and send the information to kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
Love this series, Ken. It‚Äôs been very helpful in getting my head around how to organise my projects :) thank you!
Can you review my Github profile, please?  I do not have a CS background, that's why I don't feel confident.
Congrats on 10k subs, I remember watching your first project walkthrough video where one of your goals was 10k and you said you were so far off from that and now look at you
üëç Ken could you also review some good data science resumees?
@Ken Jen Thanks for this channel.The content is awesome. Please review my GitHub: github.com/jalotra.
love the new intro! keep up the good work
Hi KenJee, First of all, thank you for your guidance to the community. Your content is very informative and to the point. I would like to request help in resume preparation. I have mailed you. Please critique.
Ken need your help


I already know python I have some basic knowledge of statistic and different library used for data visualisation

nowhere is my main question of how I can train myself to professionally become a data scientist, I tried udemy courses but they were basic I want to learn things that are practically used

I did my graduation in computer science engineering so I know how to write code and all
Bro should i learn algos first or libraries like numpy matplot ?.....üôèüôè
Hey Ken, I'm a new subscriber. I have really enjoyed watching your videos. They're great and very informative. I'm interested in data science and  data engineering. I'm debating between get an MS Computer Science or MS Data Science from DePaul University.   Would you advise I pursue a CS or Data Science degree if I'm interested in both fields? Also, I believe that you went to DePaul for your MS. Would you recommend DePaul's MSCS or MS Data Science program? Thanks!
It's a good idea put the articles that helped me in the project in readme?
This is amazing! Saving all your videos for future reference too. These are super useful, thanks for all your help
Great content! 


I am in my job search and It would help me a lot if my resume and GitHub are reviewed. Thank you for this content :)
Once again I really thank and appreciate you for the video. And I like the approach having people from diverse backgrounds.
Awesome! I think you talked about a lot of points which can be found on beginner portfolios, as you have said multiple times already, documentation is really important. I notice it personally as well, once you have 90% of the project finished the last 10% can sometimes be the most tedious, even though they are really important.


I just noticed that your channel pretty much blew up after the last video and I want to congratulate you on that! :D
I was definitely sure that you would hit the 10k milestone this year but this was really a good amount quicker than I expected, so congrats to you, that was definitely well deserved!
I came across your channel recently you explained the things very well üåüüåü!! what tips would you give me as i am intrested in data science and beginner in this field .
I'll be waiting for your response.
nice vid man, was very helpful :) I have a question: is it better, when i have one repository for projects, which are separated in different folders or for every project i have to make own repository? I'm just beginner in github
Hi Ken. Great video. Does it look bad to Data Science professionals if all of an applicant's projects rely on existing packages like scikit-learn, gensim, keras, etc.? Is it significantly helpful to applicants to have their own implementations of regression, random forests, naive bayes, etc.? in the same way that computer scientist students have their own implementations of sorts and stuff
Forgot to mention it last time, I like the new intro :)
Man you are one productive dude :)
Hey,
I would be so thankful if you review my GitHub account as well. And this video is  so informative and I am learning a lot from you. I hope to become a good Data Scientist in coming days. Thanks again :)
Great video, Ken! It would have been nice if this video was around when I first started my data science journey üòÉ
A lot of people will benefit from this series!!

Again, congrats on 10k subscribers! You deserve more. Keep up the good work, Ken! üí™üí™
great insights! your suggestions are really supportive.
Hi, I'm 31 and I'm starting in data science. I'm learning python from absolubly zero and I have some math knowledge but no programming skills. Do you think I'm starting late? Could my age be a problem for finding a job on the future?

Also I'd like to know about remote work. It's possible to find out a job like that for a data scientist? If you'd make a video about it would be great. 

Recently found your channel and i love it. I'm your new sub.
I have a question. I am a beginner in data science. So i should learn hadoop, spark and stuff like that?
Keep up the good work ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice content and perfect background music!
Thanks for such a great video! I am also planning make some projects for my resume. Do you think it will be a minus to use the data from Kaggle than using the data which I obtained from websites by myself?
Super cool intro, for a minute I thought 
Where is  " Hello guys, it's ken here " :) 

I tried to search you in kaggle , could you tell your kaggle id? Thanks
Nice intro :)

how important is it, to know complex maths like algebra? In social science, we do also "data science". we write code and analyse data with machine learding models and interpret staticical outputs. but we never did anykind of math. what is your opinion on this? is it so important to know math as a data scientist? why job postings ask for STEM graduates and never social science like sociology, political science or psychology?
Do you think ai will replace data  scientists? I have applied to a master program of data science and im thinking about ai and data science.
Is this video still reliable in 2023?
Hello! I am a complete beginner but one day I‚Äôd like to work with AI. Would this be a good path to get there?
hey Ken..I am beginner and this is my day 1...should i learn prob & stats and linear algebra before and then ML and DL...if, NO...then where to start..
I really want to learn data science, but I actually know about Python...like how to code in Python.
But I actually want to know what to do to get started and be the best I data science.
Will C++ help ? 
Our college they offer C++ as the only programming language is that something that might help me as a data scientist
I told a friend of mine of my goals which are so impactful on our lives and he told me that he'll hold me accountable for it if I do not accomplish those goals in 21 days. This was my first day and I haven't made any move yet. Guys push me pursue it üôèüòµüòü
I am currently on the verge of graduating with my bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and starting my masters degree in data science in the near future, this video really helped me out!!! Accept my endless gratitude ‚ò∫Ô∏è

My Goal for the weekend : Understand existing 3 Power BI Reports.

Learn 10 Excel functions and try it.

Complete one micro course of Python on Kaggle over the weekend.

Thank you it was a great piece of guidance.
Hi Ken, PLEASE reply. 
I‚Äôve degree in Applied Mathematics and have 8 years of teaching experience at high school level. I‚Äôm starting to learn data analytics and  I‚Äôve been watching a lot of videos for the past few days on data analytics and unable to find information about people from other countries other than US, I‚Äôm from Pakistan and here we don‚Äôt have enough opportunities for data analysts and my question is, do companies from US, UK or Canada hire entry level analysts from countries like Pakistan? 
Also, at 31 years of age would I be able to get a job? I know it‚Äôs very early to ask such questions but I don‚Äôt want to go down the path where I‚Äôve no future. Thanks!
I‚Äôm really worried, I really want to get into data analytics field and I‚Äôve always been interested in CS. 
Your guidance would be great for me.
Heyy
Always code on free time like the way you consume nonsense tiktok vids and other soc med material, you'll become a master in no time
Hi Ken hope everything is going well. I have a question If I learn let‚Äôs say 5 hours a day how much time it takes become a data scientist? . Actually I have a good Python and SQL background knowledge. I mean I know all basic concepts.
My goal is to become a data scientist by building good foundations in stats and projects.
Is 30 years old too old to learn? I have an IT Degree
hi, i am learning data science and i wondering which one is better for data science 
statictics or economics?
Degree on Accounting is useful in Data Science? Does It help on job application?
Hi I am studying data science in university in South Africa
I need advice with my career
No mySQL for data science? Right now my path is Dr Chucks Python course, then packages like pandas and matlab, then mySQL, then some type of machine learning or ai. I've also been writing data science project ideas down but don't want to try and crack into them yet because I still barely know anything! Also I love your wall notes, I've wanted a big white board for SO LONG because my adhd brain will totally forget about my overarching goals and the smaller broken down steps. I also unfortunately have an insane amount of interests so it's hard for me to just stay stay stay on one path.
According to the number of view, we can easily deduce that data science professionals are the new blue collars
Thank you bro. I‚Äôm a month old on python. Do you have beginner videos I can watch?
Lets see he reply me i am no tech background mechanical engineering person in late 30 fear of coding, maths not good  i want to transition from current job to data analytics please guide
Can i first learn dsa for college placements then I have to choose my domain data science..... Or I just go directly and get placement
üëçüëç
I don't want to become a Data Scientist, I want to become a Machine Learning Engineer, do I need to learn Data Science or something else?
I have noticed that you did not recommend any database languages like sql- is there a reason for that? (I‚Äôm not from the information systems/sciences field
What's your opinion about google AI ?
Came back to watch this during my study time. Working through the algo then coming back to the theory and fitting them together. Preach üôåüèΩ
I am starting to learn now This road map will help me to reach Goal thanks üòá
very good
Thank u for sharing this
I‚Äôm planing to get Bachelors in Data Science and I‚Äôm kind of confused as if I go with University or a College that provides Degree in it. Any kind of help is Appreciated. Thanks
how much are you earning  in the meantime mate ?
nice haircut dude
So how can you get a job this way?
I have a history B's and I am basically starting from scratch self teaching myself about programing and data science. Thank you for providing multiple pathways to the end result because I cannot afford to return to college but have time and am willing to learn on my own time. I'm a lost 24 yo and seeing this calmly explained with lots helpful learning tips. This is what YouTube is still great for. Thank you....year old video so I doubt that you or anyone will see it but still thank you
Hey man, wanted to ask where you got your wallpaper ;)
Is that taking the paid course is good choice for data science?
Hi Ken, is a data scientist a software programmer? How to improve one's programming skills if one has had limited exposure or does not feel too confident about programming?
If I had to choose between data science and cloud computing what should I choose ? Plz answer me
Great video! Thanks
Thenks for this explication, my quastion is what do you think about Coursera Courses, like Applied Data Science with Python Sp√©cialisation ? Mercii
Today I‚Äôm starting my post graduate data science certification in January and it runs for 6 months, so some kind stranger(s) keep me accountable. A monthly check in will be nice :)
Thanks for creating this video and sharing your knowledge Ken. With reference to what you mentioned at 2:14. According to you what is just enough programming for Python before one starts looking into Data Science projects? What are the concepts of Python one must absolutely know before embarking on Data Science projects?
Hi Ken. I'm currently studying anatomy and I'd love to do data science. What's your advice please? I've started online classes in SQL and Python already
Hello ken, Hope you doing well!
I wanted to ask you that i want to do data science but i have done by bachelors in physics and knows lil bit about programming languages . So is this the right choice?
Is MBA in data science is different than the field  you are talking about?
Doing a complete career change from social services to data analyst with no experience or degree. This video has been very helpful. Thanks!
How data science is different depending on the industry, for example in a fin-tech, in a software development company, games development company, car factory, civil engineering, etc? it may be the volume of data, the processes, can you make a video about this topic please?
Interesting to me would be how much the skills transfer from one industry to another.
Hei Ken! Any chance you can make a new video of this topic? It‚Äôs been a year and a lot has changed ! üòÉ
Currently planning on BS in Engineering Physics and MS in Data Science, will this set me up for success? Or should I consider other degrees to properly set me up
I have a great mindset for data, however I never code with Python, who can help me basic of Python language!‚Ä¶
Hi, Amazing videos you have! One question for you and for everyone. I actually work for the militaries and I don't have a degree, but I want to change careers. Would it be possible for me to get a job in an entry level position as a data analyst after finishing the IBM data analyst certificate??
The choice of the video title is really attractive
Hi, Thanks for your amazing video and tips. I am currently working as HR Professional. I have plans to move to different country and start my career all over as data scientist. After working for 7 years in HR, i feel this as a big change for me to start over. Do you think i would be able to learn it in time?
Hello, first thank you for the quality of the video, then I wanted to have your opinion please on a career path, I‚Äôm currently working as IT project manager but I‚Äôm taking one of 365datascience course for learning data science, and I want to pursue in this field, can I balance between the two correctly ? What‚Äôs the rythm you‚Äôre advising please ? 
Thank you in advance
thanks ken jee for informative videos..i have a concerning question regarding  choosing Data Science as non-tech background. with growing data science students would u think it will be still in demand in next 2-3 yrs or so, like if we start on this path it would take 2-3 yrs and by that time it might be outdated or there will be abundance of Data scientist? How about Videos on Data scientist as a freelancer. thanks again.
Thank you so much .. very informative now I have some clarity on how to proceed with my data science course
basic statistics is enough? I'm doing a masters in engineering and I felt like I didn't know enough stats.  Good to know it doesn't go to deep in the real world.

I'm a total newbie. I need all the details i can 
get. Thanks
I've learning data science for about 3 months now. My biggest problem was one those you mentioned in the beginner mistakes video : studying too much theory, trying out too many different courses . Your videos are great , man. Really helpful. Thanks. It made me more confident about making mistakes and trying out new projects . Not just kaggle , other more difficult platforms too.
I know this video was published over a year ago
But I need your advice on this
I'm a fresh graduated biochemist and I like data science field and want shift careers to it 
Would it be easy to me to get a job in DS without academic learning just self learning?
I will like to become a data scientist in one year
Hi can I know which design Under Armour shirt you're on? It looks really nice !
Hi ken jee, thanks for this beneficial video, I am done learning python, presently I am learning data analysis with python but my main aim is to become a data scientist.
Hi 
I completed my masters 2 years back and I didn't work after that.. is it good to choose data science as a beginner without experience and a gap?
Will I get a job after doing some courses?
Hey guys, I am starting my journey in Data Science and like to connect with other people. My plan is to make a certified Course in Data Science with exercises for the portfolio. Anyone here likes to join that journey to share experiences and discuss some interesting topics? I am really happy for every joining guy :)
Ken, you should learn Sign Language next. You are most gesticular when you speak. That's a compliment by the way. Great stuff.
I work in the medical field, I graduated as a Medical Doctor in my country of origin,  but don‚Äôt practice since I moved to the US. I‚Äôm looking to integrate my medical knowledge into informatics, analytics, data, software tools, digital health, health information technology, data analysis, etc.  How can I achieve this? Is there a shortcut? Trying to direct my career path to the digital world but without having to go back to school for another 5 years üòÇ
I have a degree in Health Informatics is studying data analytics would be helpful for me?
What are prospects of Data Science as a second career, I mean is age a constraint to get a break in this field?
I'm studying Economics in College, probably my last year. I've been an Intern in Finance for ~3 years now (two different companies, also two different roles) and have just began feeling really interested in Data Science. If I could start over, I would pursue an internship in the field. I hope I can learn it and maybe even work with DS in the future. It is so much fun.
01:20 - 1) Learn programming in python or R 
01:40 - 2) Learn basic statistics for data science 
01:58 - 3) Start projects as soon as you can (Kaggle)
03:28 - 4) Take notes on what algorithms and packages others use
03:46 - 5) Learn the source code for the algorithms and try to implement them from scratch
04:48 - 6) Work on more advanced projects where you collect your own data or use advanced concepts like deep learning, nlp, or computer vision.
So data science is only a minor in my university. Should I major in math or comp sci. If I can't get a new grad job as a data scientist wouldn't a comp sci major be a safe option?
am gd at math....but not at PHY and chem .... my university gave me an option to choose between information technology and data science...which one will be better for me to choose among them?
Putting a nice photo to cheat people into watching a no quality video! Youtube should have a 'I wasted my life' button as well!
May i ask you something; i know it is a little bit silly but what do you exactly mean when you say :  built your own portfolio? Thanks!
Okay this probably is dumb question but what is the song playing in the intro? :D I might have heard it somewhere.
Iam poor at mathematics, will data science be right for me?
Great video Bud. I really appreciate it !!!
I have started exploring on kaggle. The countless different ways people solve their problems can be so overwhelming. It's like an endless ocean. Any tips on how to overcome this?
Hello. Great Advice Ken!
I am an Industrial Engineer that got into Data science by my senior year. Honestly I have not completed a single project as of yet. Now I am taking it more seriously and organizing a proper plan to achieve my goal of being a data analyst and then a  scientist.
Currently I am learning Tableau and how to do Data Analysis on it, while I plan to put a single day of every week on a data science project and finally come out to be a Data Scientist InshAllah
so helpful and informative, your video. so i do get bored at learning before applying, instead i prefer learning on the go. with said, how do i find data science project to learn from if you may guide me? thank you
Any possible combination for being a data analyst  after doing ACCA ?? Please reply.
Nice video, but I do feel the need to mention Annie Duke is a scammer
Sir want your guidance. I just passed my high school. Can i apply for data scientist or data analytics through online courses or should I have degree.????????plz ans
The fact that you just said , "the first thing to know is programming" shows the level or lack of your mathematical understanding behind the concepts of something which might seem to be as trivial as linear regression. However, most if not all credible data scientists know the complexity of math behind the aforementioned concept , ranging from intercept interpretation to exchanging penalties with constraints in regularized models which will branch out to more non linear models like svm's using KKT theorem.. Please stop misleading people like this...
Regards,
A novice Data Scientist.
Hey,
I have submitted my PhD . I am from bioinformatics background. I want to get into Data Science. Can you suggest me projects or a post doc experience to start off. I have previous knowledge of biostatistics, python , R. Which I am working on again to be ready . Thanks for such beautiful explanations and making things easy to grab through ur channel though.
Thanks Ken!
I just came across your channel - you are awesome for sharing this information! Hopefully I can get to this one day :)
I don't have CS degree background 
Can I become data scientist ?üòï
Sir if i have 4-5 years of experience as business analyst, can i become a data scientist?
Is the whole series of kaggle learn sufficient to start competition at Kaggle?
I really want to learn data science because I find it really fascinating and I want to become a data scientist when i grow (im still in school tho but I want to learn basics)
But I'm confused whether should I start learning python or statistics
If would be great if someone told me!
Awesome video. But, caveat is not a verb.
1 MILLION VIEWS!!

Congrats Ken on your first video hitting 1 million views!!

To anyone who stumbles across this video, I would NOT have recently obtained my data science job if it weren't for Ken's YouTube tutorials! 

If your trying to break into data science, SUBSCRIBE to this channel now!!  It is your one stop shop that'll teach you everything even if you're starting as a beginner.

 I'm living proof and if I can do it, so can you!!
Thanks for this video Ken. I almost gave up on data science but that's because I understood how bad my approach was after watching this video. Will try it your way and I'm sure I'll make progress. Thanks!
Dear bro,             i like your explanation of things alongwith you back daily routing chart.

good day bro and going.............
Great. Liked the clean chart about 'Plan of Action'. Good.
Hello Ken,
May the Creator bless you, Amen.
I am 57 and need advice for starting over.
Academician, Trainer, Finance, and IT with degrees in Physics and Information Systems (we worked on IBM-4330 series machines, using COBOL) back in 80s.
Did substantial coding jobs (GW-BASIC and Foxbase 1990-2002, sometimes working through entire night). 
Reasonable good with numbers, Arithmetic, and Excel. 
Done some consultancy work in the areas of Banking and Finance for Asian Development Bank.
I think I can put in 4-5 hours every day.
Goal - International Consultancy by July 2022.
Need Brutal analysis, please.
I've done my graduation in IT and I plan on doing data science. I'm going to pursue masters in computer science and pursue data science through online courses...what do u think of that
Congrats for 1M views! Many more to come, discovering your channel has been a blessing for me:)
I'm very new to this but noticed you mentioned R for sports which is relevant to my interests. Is this for things like advanced analytics teams use or gambling models? Thanks for the video!
Hi Ken, how do you go about asking the right questions and formulating good problems to solve when you come across a new domain? Would love to know your process
I'm trying so hard everyday , as day passes I feel I forgot what I have learnt  ,I have already at it for a year and have a Post Graduate once I have completed ML and NLP but still not confident and cannot recall mainly NLP concepts , yet to do Deep Learning...really tough time , but I'm sure If I keep on at it I will crack it !! In three months my goal is to revise some 10 projects and deploy using flask ,testing in postmaster , exploring hiroku , NLP and Deep Learning will definitely down my life  for sure !! But doing all this with a full job is even more horrible and keep drowning me ......
Congratulations for 1 Million views üëèüôå
I studied BBA(UG) can i study data science
woooo!!! 1 million views. congrats!
Where do I even start lol
i'm 20, have had a crush on someone for 13 years, and got rejected, i cannot get over it, i do not know how to deal with it, but i do know one thing, i am going to make it solid and big here, thank you for these videos, not only do they help with learning, but watching someone talk about things you base your life upon is really soothing. Please keep up the good work, i owe every bit of my learning to you youtubers, the literal OGs.
Thanks for all the tips!
Love this! Thank you for sharing.
Please. No bed on a background. It's gross.
Challenge accepted will try and master data science in 6 months
Thanks for your video, I've learned a lot
My goal for this year is to find a data scientist internship....
Do you think an undergraduate degree in data science is worth doing if its something that interests me? I don't reckon you're too familiar with many uk univerisites (my bad if i am mistaken) but i have an offer to study data science at warwick, and an offer to study computer science at manchester - the main reason i consider the data science degree is because i like the look of it a lot, but if i keep an interest in coding (though the degree has a lot of options for coding modules within it already), that I won't really be doing myself any wrong picking the data science undergrad over the computer science undergrad? My main concern is only that a cs grad may be viewed slightly more preferable in a range of places just by degree name, but i dont know if thats true or not
Employers dont care about Kaggle, because they aren‚Äôt real business problems to solve just a way to practice machine learning

I just signed up for Kaggle.  Let's get started!
This is the video I have been looking for!  Thank you!  I am going to come up with an algorithm to help me with my fantasy football draft this year.  A tall order, I know, but I have a couple of months.  We will see.
Love 365 data science!
I finished masters in physics.  AM I able to learn data science ? Now I just  know basic python programming and very little machine learning. Please tell me how I can grow in this field
Hi I'm doing Bachelor's in IT. I'm very much interested in Data Science. I've just started my data science journey. I've decided to study Statistics, Algebra, Data Visualization, MLA online through some courses. Will it be a good start?? And would I be able to get a job after graduation in Data science??
Hey Ken -
I'm considering pulling the trigger on investing in 365 Data Science.  It seems comprehensive and very reasonably priced.  A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses.  While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats).  I realize they are only two year programs.  Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future?  Would a comp sci program be of any use?
I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects.  Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful.  (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them).  
I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions.  I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube. 
 As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring.  It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math.  It does spark ideas in my "not-so-mathematically-inclined" brain.
Thanks again
I am newbie to Data science and carry no prior knowledge. Is there any course that I could take up to learn basics?
Is data scientist a dying career?
New subscriber here. Great video. Thank you for posting.
What is the relationship between excel certifications and data science?
please who got a job  in data science without  a master degree
Sir do we really need to go for a MSC degree if we do learn all theses things u mentioned ? . Please reply sir üôè
This is literally road into nowhere.

Hey man great content would you recommend taking the major "data science" itself
Thanks for the tips Ken, especially on studying 30 min to 3 hours blocks.  I started using Data Camp to learn about data science and have no idea what to do for beginner projects.  Then I saw you had a video on this for kaggle.  Definitely am going to check it out.
Explained here well!. I have 2 yrs as DA n last yr became DS. the amount of options you unlock by learning ml algos, stats, tools, visuals is endless. As a side hobby I'm developing predictive modelling on stock market data being a swing n long investor, pretty accurate estimates though. just need to include fundamental analysis n company prospects on top of it to make a call, earning good profits too. Its actually amazing we can do loads of stuff with Data Science, find out your passion n work on it!
Nice try Kylo Ren
Can you suggest a more reliable and dependable IDE for data science please?
I have started to learn Data Science. My goal would be: 
1. To clear all my theoretical concepts about Data Science. 
2. Spend time on R and Python everyday for about an hour. 
3. Build some models myself and go through at least one case study everyday. 

ETA - 4 months.
I was wondering if goinge to a data science bachelor would bet the right path
I'm a first year BBA student who's planning on transferring next year(so after my third or fourth semester) into a bachelor's of data science. It might take longer than normal to get the degree but yea I'm planning on doing that. What's something you suggest?
Nice wallpaper on desktop , got the link to it. :D
I want to know how to start my journey from class 12. Yeah i have to do engineering first then graduation in CS. But I dont want to do engineering, its a bit absurd but is there any other way to do anything in computer field without doing Engineering. If yes, then please explain me right from the start i.e. after my highschool.
I 'm doing research in linguistics and I 've realised I need skills in organizing data properly. So, some time ago I  became interested in data science. So far, I 've gone over some online lectures in statistics for data science and found myself really passionate about. I would like to proceed in the field but.. as I 'm not an undergraduate age person at all, after watching your video, I feel that's a too challenging road for me, and, unfortunately, I might appear to be quite old for that matter. Despite the fact people say that having proficiency in three foreign languages like I do may be an advantage in job hunting process in this area. What's your view.. Is it worth investing time in it..?)
I am venturing into Data Science field, hope this Video will help as it is my initial phase. Earlier I was working in travel industry in Product & Operations dept. (for 6-7 years). And pandemic proved need to do something else or more constructive by changing field to Technical.
I study linguistics and want to use data science to make sense of data collected. Make it presentable and useful for my future employees.
Which python IDE are you using? and which OS? I think that's also an important part of learning data science. I used macos then windows and now linux. I wasted so many hours trying to fix setting up environment/framework details..
How about Julia vs Python or R?
Thank you for this!
Could you please recommend some basic project on which one can work
You man give some hope, because learning is really never ending and unless you hear it from an expert, it can be really discouraging. Thanks man.
What are some good sources for taking courses? I took a free udacity course and liked the teaching style, but it just seemed like a lot of money. I was thinking about using treehouse, but now im just all over the place and can't make my mind up
What do you think of Jose Portilla's and Kirill Eremenko's courses on Udemy? I'm currently taking the following:

Python A-Z‚Ñ¢

Machine Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢

The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2021

Could you please give your opinion on these Udemy courses, if it's not much trouble? Thank you in advance :)
Watching the videos then reading the comments making me more excited to start.
One who is not good at maths can become a data scientist?
Thank you
Hello, I am struggling to choose a major. I have attained my associate of science transfer degree and need to choose a major. I think I am interested in an information science and data analysis program, but the requirements say you must already have a previous "skill set" with python, java, oracle, and linux, or similar to each of those. I am a first gen college student so I am extremely unfamiliar with everything basically. The counselors don't provide any helpful info about specific majors. So, can you tell me, am I supposed to study these on my own, and then apply? Do most people learn on their own, and then apply for majors involving them? I was always under the impression that most people take college courses/gain credits for these but apparently it's wrong? Isn't college for finding what you enjoy too? How would I ever know if I like data analyses and python if I've never taken an actual class on it? Sorry, I just really feel so lost right now.
Is it required to study data structures and algorithms (in depth) for data science  and machine learning?
6:22 Nice button!
- Get familiar with R and then Python 
- Learn in depth statistics
- Apply what I learned for a better understand of sports
I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently in my 8 sem.  I'm interested in coding and as data science is currently in boom i decided to switch into it  but i actually don't like math i mean like it but not that much
What's your suggestion for me should i start first with math or should i first learm coding actually I've basic knowledge in c and python
I want to make an impact though working on my area of expertise!!
Salary will make you forget about your own dream, so do something of your own even it's a small thing and live a life of freedom rather than stuck in salary zoned.......Even working in google doesn't make one happy now a days..

Data science and Machine learning jobs are biggest scam of millenium
Hi Ken, Thanks for showing your goal setting and routine sheets.
His oura ring let's you know hes a data scientist
Hi Ken Jee, really find your inputs relevant, i am starting from Data Analysis so my goals are to learn the basics then branch into SAS data programming, in time i am looking forward to Cloud data with SAS Siya and then will go into Microsoft.
Is there a need to Pass JEE examinations(or other entrance exams) to Study Data Science (In India)?
And also can you suggest some good institutions in India Where I Can Take Data Science courses?
Ken Jee? No...no, it's KING JEE.
Hi Ken! Is BA in comsci good course for Data Science?
Very well laid down.
Thank you Ken ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèΩ
I know programming very basic .....I am facing challenges in writing code like intermediate level of programming.can you help me how to improve programming and how much is the programming necessary for data science
I'll get her email address.
If I got hit. It's for the club
Ok poor boy. We find ways.
Thanks for this video Ken. Really impactful. Wish i saw this earlier, would have achieved a lot. But i believe it's not too late.
Great video bro
My goal is to get a job in data science
I am confused I become Data Scientist or a Navy Seal.
B.S Data science degree is it worth it?
Do you need a university degree to be a data science or could one be doing datacamp or 360datascience for example?
Such a great video. Thank you for your time and information. I am new to your channel and here I go to subscribe. 
My biggest goal is to be a data scientist in Marine Animals World. I wish I can work with organizations that are specialized in dealing with marine world projects.
In the 365 Data science course you learn probability first... is this really that important?
üëç
What is your opinion on DataCamp? I am trying to find something structured to go through, and this seems like a nice option. What is your opinion? Thank you
Within  February 2021 I will learn concepts of probability and statistics and try to have a solid foundation on it and then I will jump into programming ( preferably R).
Hi

I have no idea about phyton and R. How many month it takes to learn?
I am a high school student and I'm looking forward to be an ML engineer.
I also really enjoy coding in general(school is teaching HTML so basics but i enjoy it u knw).
Also I'm willing to learn python in my vacations *lmao nerds* 
Do u suggest going in the field?
I'm kinda scared by the pressure of work tho hehe
1:20

Thank me later.
Hey man, just came across you and really enjoyed and learned a lot from you! I'm someone who finished 2 years of college, finished all my general classes in a communications. However I just didn't see the value of finishing school at the time and went into Real Estate and has been great. However my passion is soccer analytics. I have a blog where I post all my visuals of my data analytics and it's picked up great traction! However I want to do data analytics for soccer full time but I don't know what the best route is. Either go back to school and get analytics degree or taking an online course/certification for all the soccer analytic knowledge I need. Any insight or advice for what route is better?
I wish there was a google classroom for beginners who are studying data science with a expert in the group who could guide usüòì

You still replying?
Hi, I want to know that after few years experience in data science, How this experience will useful ,if some one want to become enterprinur, and what and all those fields, thank you.
Hi Ken! GREAT video! I'm struggling to escape tutorial hell, any tips? I learnt pandas and regression recently but I'm still getting stuck with cleaning the data and feature engineering.
This was a great video! I am a college student that plans to pursue a career in biology/ecology research and we use a lot of R lol. I think the steps you outlined in this video are a great way to get familiar with data science for research applications! Do you have any advice for learning basic data science for bio?
Sir , as of now , is it necessary for a degree in data science ? Or being self taught and having degree isn't much different ?
Since I am in high school , I still have a choice to go for a data science degree in college next year.
i want to join NASA a  data scientist  so what steps i should follow
would pure math be better in long term for data science than stats?
Ken, What books are you reading?
Well, I would had spent more time going outside in 2019 than 2020 thats a fact ^^
Very useful stuff. I would start at 3:30 and watch at 1.25 speed.
Thanks for this video! But I have few questions.
1. In my country, There is no such thing as data science course in our universities. What courses should I take for data science? Shoud I take math, statistics or CS? and do I need to take Master's Degree?
2. Did you learn DS or ML first? or both at the same time?
3. and Is it possible for me to learn it myself(with help of online resources)?
This guy replyin to each comment no cap. What a real G.
I am doing undergrad in Civil engineering. Is there any way i can switch to Data Science ??
I'm just here because I am trying to learn more cuz I want to make a program and know nothing about proper data manipulation and all that jazz, so lets see where this goes.
Hey Ken, I'm a second-year Data Sci student and I enjoyed your vid. Youtube recommended me this but I wish it had sooner as it had quite a few things I wish I'd done before I started! Although I was wondering if you could show us what the k-means graph would look like at 1:34? Anyway, great vid and keep doing what you're doing.
You have some good points but the problem is that most projects require deep learning knowledge. The Kaggle courses won't teach you how deep learning really works or what the parameters do so you are just going blind. I think once you get grounded with programming and the math you should do the HSE course on Deep Learning.
Love those goals! any luck on those Real Estate investments?
This is great! Since this week is almost done, next week I‚Äôd like to finish my JavaScript course and make a webpage myself.
Anyone remember those sites in the 2000s where you click on one link for a video, then it just goes to another page full of links and then you click a link there and it goes to another page of links and on and on. That's what this video is like.
I didn't see the video yet (but I will, after writing this). I would spend 95% of my time with software engineering topics. I wouldn't touch anything related to data science.
Hey Ken! Great videos, I just found you last week and have been going through your channel. I was wondering your opinion on whether or not going back to school is essential, or worth it? I am 30, with a associates of mechanical engineering that I got 10 years ago and never used. Do you think just learning these things that you have listed here without going back to complete my bachelors degree (in data science or statistics) would be enough to get me a position as a data scientist in the next 1-2 years?

Data mining tutorial.
is a height ranking in kaggal is a well showcase of my experience and knowledge in the field and can land a data scientist job based on it or i still need to get a college degree in CS or math? how can i get that heigh ranking?
Ken, Thanks for production effort and links. As retired HW engineering, am 40 years removed from classroom-like statistical/stochastic computations. Work had boiler-plate modeling with plug-n-play solutions. Have a good 30,000 ft. view of statistical tendencies, probability distributions & FS/FT behavior. Prepared for math remediation; calculus, ODE, LinAlg, PDE and basic prob/stat  augmented with R & Py. Can you suggest a roadmap or decision-tree representation for stats classwork beyond Intro to Stats/Prob. and which texts work best for the practitioner? SABERMETRICS (baseball) pique my interest most along with other obvious statistically-driven current events. With a plethora of free and accessible online resources, prefer self-guided, for the most part, approach.
Great advice, and I think this video is great because it talks about the many different paths you could end up taking on a road into DS.  The tip to do some real-world projects is key for understanding.
thank you for your advice!!
Kaggle - recommended website for datasets, learning data science
Pin my comment
does being accountable means having a goal and stay true to it ?

I kind of overthink it, seeing ‚Äòaccountable‚Äô as a duty for me to stay ethical during programming process.
This is the first video I've been able to sit through engaged in a genuinely interested and joyful way on the topic of data science. You're not gimmicky or salesy. Thank you so much!
Do we need to understand data structures and algorithms for data science?
Hey Ken, Thanks for the honest advice about the data science field.  Are there any sites you could recommend to get the basic statitics understanding?  Something like Kaggle.com?  Maybe free?  :)  Thanks!
I liked how you outlined your goals!  You crushed your subscriber goal for 2020! congrats!
Bro i just completed my engineering and want to start a career at datascience and i  need.a good online teching site for datascience you prefer
What does a "basic understanding of statistics" entail?
Thanks for making this video Ken! It was really informative especially for a non STEM background student like me.
Can you please suggest cloud computing vs Data scientist?
Tips for real and wannabe data scientists: don‚Äôt become I diva and learn how to program properly. Next : learn a proper programming language that is performant and productionasible.
This seem the video not say where to learn to get the knowledge enough. 
Where to learn stat?
Do I need and ABET certification why or why not?
Thank you so much for recommending Kaggle. I had never heard of that site before. You may have just saved me a lot of money. lol
What should my career path be to attain a job on sports analytics after completing msba program? 

I have heard msba is less programming intensive as compared to ms in data science. How much does that impact in getting a job in sports analytics??
This is very helpful. Am interested in learning from the masters.
Hey Ken...can you tell how to study data structures and algorithms for data science
Thank you so much for this video! It's really useful and I'm going to follow your suggestions! =D

Hi Ken, thanks for your insight!

I'm a Masters in business, currently working as a Sr. Data/Business analyst for a supply chain company. I've recently changed my path from being a mechanical engineer who worked in the green energy field. I've always been fascinated by code and have quite some background in C++, I've taken some basic courses in python and have been doing a ton of exercises.

I'm thinking of progressing to a PM role in the future with the help of some DS certifications. Is there any career path advice you can help me with? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!
Hello, I majored in Biology in undergrad and I want to switch to data science. Can you give me some advice considering that I have minimal quantitative background
This is so useful! I'm currently learning python because I always got suggested to "master" it (especially the most used libraries for data scientist/analyst like pandas, numpy, etc.). Is there anyone here who want to get $15  off to learn python too using premium interactive platform (I'm using Dataquest)? Just reply ny comment right away and I'll give you the referral code to get the discount!! ‚ú®
My goal is to create a chatbot for my coaching business that will kick off on Udemy by next April. I just completed a month long Python boot camp and can now begin the real conversation design. My roadmap is in a paper I presented last September in Durban, SA - just as motivation to keep me at it. I‚Äôm a cybersecurity analyst and acquired my master‚Äôs degree in Linguistics at UGA in 2017. I guess I‚Äôm saying  all this to force myself to stay on track and change careers to machine learning. No one around me (including hubby, kids or friends) is interested in machine learning enough to make this their second (non-paying) job, the way I have üëÄ-> as of now. Between home, family, work, and an elderly mom in Africa,  I only have enough time to watch amazing videos like these. 

Thanks so much Ken!

P.S. from another video I just listened to, I‚Äôve had the imposter syndrome all my life üòÅ.
Hey ken, what classes would you recommend taking in high school to become a data scientist? I‚Äôm currently in 10th grade taking honors algebra 2 and ap chemistry, and I‚Äôm really all over the place on classes I should take. What types of other classes are recommended for the field?
Hi Kenny,  how about the DataQuest platform for Data scientists? Do you recommend investing money in it?
Hey. I am a graduate with Statistics as my subject. I am about to complete a diploma in Data Science. No technical background or job experience. I want to dive deeper into Data Science. What would you suggest me pick between getting a masters in Statistics, or drop and focus on more Data Science learning for one year. I am really confused with this decision :-(
i started with python that is really difficult actually .i didnt have any data science knowledge .then i started learning SQL alone.evertjing was clear .if u get basic idea u can do anything
Hey Ken
Is it possible to become a Data Scientist with a Bachelor in CIS and a Master Degree in Data Science or Business Analytics?
Thx
i think we should make AI more powerfull and intelligent i am thinking about make a neural network who can code something itself and also learn from it if anyone is interested in my thinking please mail me on virat.bhatt12@gmail.com . i want to do something out of the box but am a newbiei need to learn more things right now.
How can anyone think the courses on Kaggle is good, I'll never know. I tried them, and was completely speechless. They are so bad, it's insane. And the Instructors are technicians who are so over the hill. I think that's why they're so bad. I need someone who's a beginner like me, not someone who's been working for 10 years.
Video starts at 1:15
"Learn the source code for the algorithms and try to implement them from scratch" - Can you please make a short video on this.
Thanks üòä
I'm from economic background if i want to enter in data science field what should i do how many years will take me to understand
Hey Ken
I just finished my graduate certificate and realised that I need to learn more to get a job.  I might continue on with the data science masters. Just wondering. What monitor are you rocking and if you were going to invest in a budget monitor what size should you get?
Cheers
Jason
(Thanks for your help earlier)
Good motivation booster! Since this down time I have started on the path of a new career in data, I have completed: 1) cert scrum master, 2) cert of completion up & running power bi desktop with maven analytics, 3) currently enrolled in sql; I plan to take pyhon & tableau next; how do I find a mentor or data project to join to apply my new learning? thanx
How much time I should spend by week? I‚Äôm in a university doing statistics and I already work in the field but I feel like I should been looking for more kaggle datasets or more complex problems but or i look too simple datasets or too complicated. 
There is a intermediate list of datasets?
If you‚Äôre in 12th year of high school and i wanna go into data science what advice would you give?like what subjects to take on etc
Is an applied mathematics undergraduate a good path to data science?
to be honest, i think it's really hard to apply data science to companies if you graduated with non (it, math, physc) and never took a course. Because many company need a written evidence like certificate from us which states that we really have skill in data science. I know we can study python, sql, or any program language with self-taught in online platform but that's not enough to prove that we can do data science...
i am learning data science RIGHT NOW so this is interesting. Python and stats and machine learning and TINY POTTED PLANTS YES
I've seen a promotion link from you for 365 subscription but I kinda lost it and can't remember where I found it. Could you send me a link please?
Great content Ken, would you recommend AWS Machine Learning?
Just waste money, after several years, this job market will just be saturated. It is just a ponds trap.
Hey Ken,I am an under degree graduate.If I learn data science through online will company hire me? If yes then which is best online platform for beginners.
Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.  There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision.
Hey, Ken I also want to learn data science but i am confuse form where i start to learn data science. Can you provide me Step that i can follow to be a data scientist
I have enrolled for this course and I am currently undergoing the rigors of it.

A couple of years down the line I want to build ML algorithms that do simple yet effective stuff. My weak area is statistics and this is something I really need to improve on. Understanding the equations of the graph to begin with maybe? Although I know a lot of statistical packages do most of the stuff for you but I believe understanding the underlying algorithm or the derivation of the equations would be helpful further down the line as I progress. With plethora of resources, I simply don't know where to get started and where to stop. I understand the python codes that someone else may have written but I am yet to reach a stage where I can start building something from scratch and that is something I really need to push myself to achieve as quickly as I can. Any help to get me closer to this is much appreciated!
Man, I can't take programmers who use Windows seriously! :P
Oh wow !!! thanks too much for this video it makes me loving more data science.
My Gol actually is in one year being able to work as a data scientist with python.
I'm an financial (auditor) but python has been always a program that interest me too much specially the 
data science part.
So please i'm open to learn and improve my self and the most have fun in this environment of learning.Again thanks you very much
Who else scroll through the video to find the path shown in the thumbnail like me?
Is knowledge of sorting algorithms useful?
There is a degree on the college that i applied to that has data science as an undergraduate degree, its pretty cool but it goes more through the math and statistics path
I've recently been failing so many software engineering internship interviews . To be honest , I'm sick and tired of how hard SWE is. With all of it's Data structures, algorithms  and it's challenges on leetcode ,  it gets really stressful. I took a udemy course on data structure and brushed up my coding skills for Java , but I still struggled . I've been looking into other fields such as Maching learning , Cybersecurity , and Data science.  what do ya'll think I should do ?
Dear Ken, I just finished my mechanical engineering in june 2020. Now I want to pursue my career as a data scientist but since I know it's a huge field and I can't just jump in. SO I have decided to opt for data analytics from springboard. So acn u plz guide me on this ken.
I'm a recent Bioinformatician graduate and I'm looking to switch to Data Science. I am quite fluent in R but also have good insights in Python and Java, although I steel feel a bit wobbly (the fact that I'm a slow programmer is what bugs me the most). Given that I already have a base in statistics, programming and database theory, would you be able to recommend a particular structured course that could be good for me? Thanks for the websites you recommended anyways!
.
Hi Ken! great video mate. I was looking for these types of advice. I'm just starting my journey here and I enrolled in my city uni toward a master degree in DS. I haven't got a strong math background but find it not difficult to learn to program. What will be your advice in terms of maths?
Is it possible to enter the field as a self taught or is a bachelors and above required?
You are good person
This is like a ad.
Thanks for a very useful video. I am wondering though, where would I begin ? Do I learn Python first or do I start with basic in statistics and math. Or a foundation in data science ? Do you recommend any Data Science courses ? Finally what is a realistic timeline to be somewhat advanced in this field if one spends 10 hours a week ? Thanks a lot.
Great video. I'm a mech engineer and have a couple of months in Codecademy data science and computer science. I have used Python before in a college projects of statistics and vehicles but now I really want to be able to feel condident saying I use it. Learning by doing projects and uppering the level is the best option, keep on with the good advice!
I'm a product manager that is looking to build up data analytics skills. Do I really need to go deep into programming to build a data science background?
Hey Ken, amazing video - I always appreciate your material. I‚Äôm currently working in a fairly big bank as a data analyst, the job doesn‚Äôt require the use of very strong programs, excel and Adobe at best. Before I started this job I wasn‚Äôt 100% on going into DS but now that I am, would you say it‚Äôd be a good move to do a master‚Äôs in DS to try and move into more pure blooded data scientist roles? Or is it realistically possible to do that by self teaching with the help of kaggle etc? for context, I have a solid BSc in Maths/Stats so I‚Äôve had a little exposure to R and Python. Thanks in advance!

I'm transitioning from a med student to data scientist. Currently applying to masters programs. Your videos have been really informative! Thanks!
I wish I had access to this sort of video when I was starting my career.
Hey Ken,
I am doing Masters in Business intelligence and data analytics and i have started with Python for now and been a month already. Should I learn R by side with Python because it‚Äôs in our syllabus or should I start ML now? Also i am almost done with Statistics too. Please suggest. Also if anything you can suggest me from your end it will be really helpful,thank you.
Hi Ken, I am a PhD graduate in Information and Communication Engineering (India).My research work was in the domain of Wireless communications. I want to become a Data Scientist. Please suggest me the steps I should take in order to achieve my goal. Is it ok to gain knowledge through online ed-tech platforms? Is certification mandatory in order to become a data scientist? Hope you ll answer my queries!!! Thanking you in advance!!!
I am interested in predictive analytics, especially in the non-profit human services organizations. Any thoughts
Can i pursue ML/AI after electrical engineering ???
Good day! Do we need math for DS?
my 5 yrs has just begun
Hello ken. I am a full stack developer and high school student in 12 grade. I have a sound knowledge in this field. I want to be a data scientist. And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science. Thank you :)
Hello Ken Jee and everyone, I'm an Industrial engineering graduate, so I have good foundation in statistics and its applications. All I want is to solve real world problems through data  which is why I'm pursuing data science or to be specific Machine Learning. I'm kindda frustrated because my work right know is just using SQL to make data visualizations for other teams the company I'm working for. I feel that I'm undervaluing myself. I need your advice, what should I do to be able to get a job that actually analyzes data and giving insight into it.
Hi, the data analysis thing looks so awesome, and I think I would have the time learn a few things since I'm currently in the last year of my Senior years. I want to enter the data science field, but also want to take Math as a major in college. Do you think it would be beneficial for me to take Math as major?
Hey Ken, i have applied for a 6 months data science course which will probably help me get a job by the time it's over. Do you think I'll be able to grasp it all in such a short period of time with basic programming knowledge in python?
As always thanks for that great video!‚ù§Ô∏è
Hi.. I'm a MBA graduate with some 7 months of experience in HR, now I'm thinking about changing my career to data science, I signed up in Kaggle and started learning python, should I do any certifications course to get a job? And also I'm 25 now, is it too late to start from zero?.. pls suggest me something
Is it possible to learn data science and get u know a real job, if u didn't study it in school just Learn it by yourself?
Hi Ken, this was a very informative video. 
I am a .NET MVC Full stack developer with 5 years of exp, but I am really fascinated with the concepts of NLP and CV. I set forth on my learning journey 2 months ago, using MOOCs to have a fair idea of ML. Now I have basic background into different models, plotting, EDA etc. and Python. Should I first perfect ML before moving to NLP, or should I change career into ML and then continue to pursue NLP? How should I set a timeline around this? Will my exp still be valid?
Hi, thanks for sharing with us this tips. At the moment I‚Äôm studying physics degree, and also learning python skills apart from the ones taught in the university. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the right path to become a data scientist. Is the physics degree useful for it?
My goal for the next year is:
1: learn python and sql
2: start building my own projects
3: Get a 6-month internship in my final year of engineering.
4: And then finally get a job in the data analysis field.
Heyy brother it was such a relief to have found the deep wisdom you poured in through this video. I'm extremely grateful to you.
Thank you Sir for sharing all the information. I bought your class at Udemy it is an excellent!!
How to get real world projects?
How can i start learning programming from zero knowledge
From a noob that knows things here and there but has no idea how to do methodically approach this: Thanks for this!
I have already undertaken Coursera's IBM data science professional certificate and about to finish it this week. As a beginner I learnt a lot but  feel there is still a long way to go!! Do you think this certificate and projects of my own will help me fetch a job in this field? 
I would really appreciate if you reply!!!
Soo....8-10 hours a day 5-7 days a week for three years... that was too much?
Hi Mr. Ken, I enjoyed watching this video. Great advise! Can you give me ideas about the latest application of ML that can be considered as project in my IT course. Thanks.
Hi! I am new to Data Science. I have a Civil Engineering Degree and a MBA. I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C++ (unfortunately this was over 10 yrs ago), I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms, not so much the language. I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables. I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals...which was far easier to do than solving it by hand. I also understand statistics and have  13 years of engineering experience. I have decided to start with learning Python. I am going the self taught method. Is there some good resources you can recommend, textbooks, free webinars, professional societies, communities and methods to building a portfolio.
Thank you for sharing your advice!!
Hey Ken thanks for sharing your experiences
I am doing my master specialization in A.I & ML.
Any suggestion for any open source project in which i can indulge in.
Hey - could I email you about this? I would really like your guidance. I've done some python (basic programming, numpy, pandas), basic probs and stats (pdf, cdf, distributions). I started the Titanic problem on kaggle, and I'm working my way towards a solution. Is this a good way to study? Look for problems and then Google/read your way towards a working solution. I tend to stick to traditional ways of studying-- do all the theory at once and then get to problem solving. Please please please respond with your thoughts!
thanks üëçüèª
hi i graduate in civil engineering and i want to work with data science. I've been learning for 3 months and planning my next step . Do you think i should do another graduation or just some especialization on the field?
Hey Ken, would you say knowing Algorithms is important for becoming a data scientist? I love deep learning and analytics but heavy CS topics like Algorithms or Data Structures bore me to death
I'm about to start my masters in Data science but I'm still afraid of kaggle. üòõ
I have an undergraduate degree in finance, and I am considering entering the data science field. The local university offers a post-baccalaureate certificate in data analytics. I would only need to take a few courses to complete the certificate such as data mining, database management, and big data management.  Do you think this is a good way to start in data analytics?  The courses I complete for the certificate would also count towards a master's in data analytics.
What use C as my programming language, is it fine or will it be useless?
Hi @Ken Jee, thank you for this vid informative video (couldn't find elsewhere). I wanna become a Political Analyst, where Sentimental Analysis is more used rather than statistics! Can you help me direct how can I achieve that? I am Pol science student with foundational knowledge in Python and still learning it!
I am a commerce student having background in financial management and accounts....I was looking forward to doing something that would integrate finance and data analytics...should I start with python or r..‚Ä¶¬øor what should be ur suggestion thanks in advance
How about data analytics? I studied computer science and I feel that I'm not confident in programming yet. And I feel that Data Science needs more programming and statistics than Data analytics. So, should I start with Data analytics? thoughts?
Sir just one question do I really need to be an expert in maths for being a data scientist ?  I'm actually not from Mathematics field , should a pursue or drop . üôè
Priyanka Roy, Head of Data & Artificial Intelligence at Intergen talks about vision for your AI strategy on Engati CX. She says that companies should spend more time to know what the problem is, work on it and the user and then bring in the technology. She also mentions that data is extremely important and every AI strategy should be backed by data.
Data science vs data analytics what‚Äôs the difference?
I'm 3.5 years in the game, almost have a masters degree in data science. And recruiters treat me like im nothing because my educational experience isn't real to them. Hundreds of applications. Thoughtful cover letters. Zero interviews. My project portfolio needs an update but honestly I don't know what to do. Im a data scientist but i can't even secure an unpaid data analyst internship INTERVIEW. Any advice is welcome
Hi, I'm a mathematics major college student and I've recently started working on data science. I find making my own projects quite hard as I don't have any ideas to start with, would be great if you could help!
Is it alright to learn DS if the language you're using is c++?
Nice.. thanks!!
I believe data science is a must-have skill. even when you think your current field is not related to data science, eventually it would be!
Hi ken,
I want to know whether classical algorithmic concepts such as greedy methods, divide and conquer, dynamic programming etc. are necesaary to learn before moving to ML. 
Waiting for your reply...
After 20 years in IT mostly support, I am starting to learn data science and it‚Äôs my new goal, started learning sql, python and power BI.
hey want to learn data science i am a beginner
Thanks, It was a really good.
But I would still prefer to take short courses from Bakeminds
http://datascience.bakeminds.com.
They have good range of short courses on Data Science.

I recommend people to visit this page, if you are looking to learn data science
https://datascience.bakeminds.com/search-courses

And provide number of resources for free like- books/blogs/videos.
Hey man, thank you for this video. Well what I want to achieve is to land an internship and I'm a total beginner. How should I take this up from bagging a job point of view?
I see that most of data scientist job requirements to have at least msc or phd in computer science or machine learning

Is that true please need answer
I apply the concept of exciting accountability in my life, it involves making yourself accountable by telling people/the internet that youre embarking in a project, hopefully with a timeline, this pushes me to keep through. I did this by telling my friends and family I was learning how to code and that I was starting a YT channel and it has worked so far. I love learning skills so I will definitely check your Ultralearning video!
Hi, I am from healthcare background, nd i got admission in Canada tor Health Analytics.I don't have prior knowledge in data science but i am interested. But many of my aluminis told this will be very difficult for a person from healthcare background without knowledge in programing nd data science. My program is one year post graduation diploma in Health Analytics in canada.should i change my decision? Can i do this? Can you please guide me
You're literally describing what exactly I am doing to be a data scientist. Many thanks for confirming it.
Good Job, Harold!
Hey Ken do you recommend Edureka? I am a complete beginner and am trying to build my programming knowledge specifically for data science. Thanks!
Hi Ken I just finish my Python Course and i'm also confused where to start about my DS Career i have learned Some libraries too but i'm still confused and i can't figure out how to maximize how to start without wasting my time
No sql
I'm 2nd year cs student I'm curious to know do i need to go for higher education in data science Or i can just complete my BE degree and then go for job experience
Don't just trust your gut. Watch Nico Gramenz as he explains the value that data brings to decision making. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnceimy4VrU
Thank you Ken.
Thanks for the advice man, I'm leaving a like
Great video Ken! 

My goal: I want to pivot out of career in finance/advertising and into a career where I can answer questions in business or society via using numbers. My intellectual curiosity is not being scratched anymore in my current career. I want to dive headfirst into a field where not only is that intellectual curiosity being scratched but where I am also encouraged to explore, learn, and take risks.
Hi hope you can help me out here, I am doing my Honours in Mathematics and Finance and I have developed love for Data science during the year, but I am not sure how to go about learning it, coming from a mathematical and finance background I do not have that much experience with coding but I do have basic python skills, I am not sure if I should do a masters programme in data science or if I should take on an online course.

Can you please help me out.
Thanks Ken for this video, it inspired me a lot and I think I got some motivation from your goals that you pasted on wall written in big words : )
What kind of equipments do you need to take  a data science course?
Dear Ken,

i have given a look at "Sprawlball" on your desk and i have checked on Amazon. It looks like a book that talks about how to analyze basket matches. My questions is: in what ways might reading this book help a data scientist?
My goal is to build an app that uses data science to help others achieve their goals!
Very good information!  I agree with you that reading others‚Äô code is the best way to learn!  I just uploaded a case study demo of data analytics.
Very annoying background music. Also in podcast. Otherwise perfect.üòå
Does helping python for become a data scientist
Im 20 and know nothing about data science but find the concept of it interesting. Would I need college qualifications in this field to be accepted hypothetically?
I have undergraduate in financial engineering and I want to pursue a master in Data science and business analysis .. I do have this much of coding background any advice
Mine starting from June was to learn Rstudio and Python3. I got the basic machine learning in Rstudio and data visualization in Python3. I wanna understand neural networks in R and basic machine learning in Python before school starts.
Awesome advice. I have just begun my DS journey and this gave a roadmap. Thank you Ken
Hey l just saw your channel which is totally helpful to me.. I am a civil engineer and want to get in this specific field. I haven't started to study yet but I believe that your videos will temp me to do it... And also, do you have an Instagram?
I'm a graduating student in BS Forestry but technology and programming is my passion. Do you think there is a field in Data Science where I can still apply my degree?? And do you think I should take another degree or should I just take Masters and Certificates? Thank you so much this video is very helpful and I like how you still reply to every comments until now.
Just beginning to explore a career change into data science. Thanks for the great video. I'll be sure to watch some more!
Nice. Thanks for the information brother.
Thanks and please don't stop posting such nice video. Helping me a lot.
I want to start learning data science but I am a bit overwhelmed with the number of courses and videos, can anyone please guide me with a road map or something so I could learn and start practising as soon as possible
I love this! Thanks!
What level of mathematics should one have in order to start?
Do you think it‚Äôs realistic to strive for a Data Science career having only a highschool education? Most job descriptions make it seem like having a masters college degree is not optional but I really like Python and Machine Learning. Would I be more successful trying to become a software engineer instead?
Hey Ken, which courses should one do out of the courses that you mentioned on Kaggle for a foundational knowledge before one moves onto projects? Because there are about 15 of them on Kaggle. Help out!
Thank you so much for your videos. I am about to start my journey :) This is such a great channel. I love your mindset and the way you explain things.
Great video! Any tips for a mid 30s changing career fields from XYZ to a data science related field?
Man this is just a fantastic video. Thank you so much. Take care :)
Great video!
Since many data science jobs these days require masters degree, I'm planning to take one. But my Bachelor's is in physics and I didn't take many cs/DS-related class. I had only taken an computer programming intro & computational physics intro. Didn't take linear algebra or such. Any tips how to take Master's degree in DS with my background?
I have a question. I have a good understanding of python. Should I learn numpy and matploylib before starting with like a book on data science, or I can begin and learn as I move on?
I'm very young and I've been learning a lot of programming for many months. I had already started when I was 13, but nowadays I feel more enthusiastic than before. This kind of videos are really helpful and motivating. Thanks!
In the age of 27 can I learn data science and also I will get job?
just choose python and use jupyter notebook, better for begginers
I'm doing a course on Machine Learning, I would it's intermediate level. I'm also looking at data science, but honestly I'm not sure what I'm gonna do or what I want to do. I'm just learning whatever makes sense and I think I'll figure it outüòÖ
Great video. How do you think coding challenges play into this? I am more computer science focused, and just graduated, and have been spending my time solving online coding challenges on hackerrank and such. Do you consider this inferior to coding projects or also a good way to learn?
Great video senior. In Kaggle which tool is mostly used for the competitions or lessons, R or python, or both?
I like to be more into how software works there advancement printed circuit making an advanced software etc so BTech in computer science with ai and machine learning would be apt for me
If I took b tech in computer science with ai and machine learning will I be able to break into data science
I am concerned about the Math part. Some insights on that area will be really helpful. Please advise.
You are a hero, man. You saved my ass. Thanks alot.
Is that an oura ring? Thank you Ken for the honest helpful information, I am starting my journey into data science and this was very helpful!
Thank you for your video it was so much helpful and insightful. I'm happy that I watched your video.
thank a lot for the video :)

i want to know how to use python to dowland tweets and how i use them to analyse the sentiments by using "getoldtweets " package
Love this!  As a pragmatist I find it appalling how intimidating this field appears before you start diving in and getting your hands dirty. Hopefully people can start to understand that DS is human intuition applying math and computing as a tool but not a concept separate from real word problem solving.
All the Best for Ryder Cup ;)
That's good information. Thank you so much!
I followed this video of yours and started with course from both Kaggle and Google along with a blog. Thanks for the advice.

My goal this week is to finish a project on EDA for a FIFA dataset and learn about Ensemble Technique.
hey ken can you give me an insight on the language R as you told it is used in sports? how is it used in sports?  it would be a great help
Halo ken. Am a student of commerce finance option ,expected to graduate this year. Am so hungry for the knowledge of data science please advise on how, where I can learn data science and how long it will take me. Please reply
Thanks, you really did cover all the topics that I've been looking for. Great work :)
He is Suggesting being Professional NOT FAIR DUDE
Hey Ken ,I want to get good at data science for industrial level,how shall I start?
I want to learn Data science guide me.
I am an electronics engineering student. I have done a python beginners course on udemy. I want to apply in the field of data science. Could you please guide me with what my next steps should be.
My goal for this week: finish the SQL datacamp course, do one Cornell course of ML each day. Hope I can make it!
Hey Ken, I enrolled in the Data Science course and I was wondering if it would be useful in any way ?  Do you really work a lot with Excel in your Data Science profession ?
Greetings Ken Jee. 
Thanks for the clear and concise explanation. 
No doubt, with the current global climate given the pandemic, this area of study is going to pick up tremendously. 
Great to have someone guide us in the right direction. 
Hope you and family are keeping well during this difficult period.
Thank you
Hi Ken, could you please do a video about how to move out of the intermediary stage where you have good amount of knowledge of programming and statistics but you just can't seem to figure how to get to the next stage and be fully proficient in data science projects. 
thanks.
Great work Ken
I'm working on pursuing a Python basic concept by the end of this week.
My goal is to apply deep learning in Computational Biology and to do a big project based on that. Being a bio student this is my niche I want to work on. Hopefully, I will learn enough to get a research internship.
Thanks for the initiative.
the more i look at you the more you look like David Schwimmer from his Friends days lmao
Thanks a lot!! can you please share some recommended  books for data science learning.
I‚Äôm trying learn data science 7-8 months
Hi Bro,  I am already with 10 years of experienced in IT CRM technology.  I wanted to move in to Datascience. I am already working in a data science company on crm. Is it a good option to move into datascience after 10 years of exp?  Does company expect more if i join as a experienced person. Actually i am getting a good salary but still i am just working on a tool which has just limited growth.
Tired of python python but no internship yet.
Hi I¬¥m student of Actuarial Science in Mexico.  My major has a lot of subjects related to Data Science (statistics, maths and code), but I¬¥m really interested in have more knowledge on  Data Science. I have seen a course in EDEX from Harvard about Data Science. Apart from all the good advice you gave us, will you think is a good idea to join this course? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Really informative, our students recommended it
Hey Ken Jee, thanks for the video it was really helpful and highly motivated. Currently i am self employed and thinking about a career transitions towards data science and i am new to coding but i have a Bachelor degree in mathematics. I really have a passion for it so finally i thought why not give it a go. Will you please let me guide towords it step by step. what certificate do i need for a good resume or is self study is sufficient. Please help!
What  resource  for statistics do you recommend to get started
I am currently in medical school but I want to learn data science so that I can use that knowledge in my research projects.Having so much work to do from the college side it‚Äôs becomes difficult to decide how much I want to learn and in what time. Can you give some tips?
I'm medical personnel, now pursuing my PhD, I was never good on Data science, its not our primary goal in medicine. But now after entering Phd my supervisor recommends R so that I can be able to analyze my data, it kills me. Any advice?
thank you for the video and all of the information! i‚Äôm completely new to this field and done with my second year doing a different degree and hope to specialise in data science so this was a great starting point to get a grasp on the seemingly vast information out there! can‚Äôt wait to check out more videos and gain more knowledge! as for my goal this summer: relearn python coding from my high school years!
Thanks ,I need to learn the data science and currently i'm pursuing b.tec and i'm good at python also very passionate about to learn data science
Hello Ken, very refreshing videos! üôÇ
I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications.
Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist? I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples/materials what to study and pace for passing them.

Cheers!
I have some grasp on Deep Learning and Python programming.
But when it comes to applying my knowledge on the datasets I suck.
Any tips my dear fellow learners??
thank you for  the info you provide.
Very nice video, I'm studying data science and business analytics right now (I hope to finish my bachelor next year) and your videos are always very helpful and insightful.
Seeing what people have done on Kaggle can help, but better than Kaggle projects is to make your own projects which will require that you obtain data on your own or from someone else. It's more effective for the learning process when you have a connection to the stakeholders.
Thank youu
Thank you for such a direct, no frills video.

Would you say that learning SQL is still a big part of data science?

Sorry if this was already asked, but skimming 800+ comments (well done btw) isn't easy üòÖ.
Cool video mate 
How to know about some beginner projects on kaggle i mean working on titanic model is cool i guess
Step 1: learn COBOL!
Hi ken, I have a question, do you know if George Washington university‚Äôs certificate in data analytics is a good way to Start out in data science with someone with no background in data science?
Jedi Mind Trick hands
can you please show your room? it seems very interesting.üòÄüòÄüòÄ
This was ver useful for someone new to the field! Thanks man!
Thanks for the advice (subscribed right away :D). Can you help explain how do you choose the right method (SVM, Random Forest, etc) to be implemented in a model for any dataset? Does it depend on the complexity of the data?
Thank you Ken!
I start this lesson from subscribing this channel üòéüëå
Follow right after this video üòé
dear Ken, 
May ask you to send me the link for basic statistic course? the link you shared is not the correct one.
Thanks for sharing this. I've been kinda back and forth on my data science journey since I started a month ago. I started a trial with one learning site but had to quit because I don't have the funds now. Hopefully, I'll find a community here.
This guy is like the Jet Lee of Data Science
hello ken,
do you know any free resources for learning statistics (for beginner) , i have zero knowledge in this ?
I am an entry level software engineer in the pension domain. But I want to work in the data science field for music technology, specifically Music Information Retrieval. I have an average programming experience through MATLAB and C++. I will be following some of your tips to get started on my data science journey but this was definitely motivational and directional.
Hi, I am a grade 12 student who wanted to get in the field of data science is there any chance that I can learn data science in 1 year(I only understand python) and if so can u guide student like us.
I want to learn Computer Vision in 2 months to be able to get going with a research with my university professor
My mini projects and things I would like to learn in 3-6 months:
1. Python programming with raspberry pi. set up good sensors to collect data. 
2. Machine learning- neuron network,  focus on image processing, object detection. 
3. Some database management with MySQL and python. I still want to enhance my data visualization skill. Maybe I will try Kaggle soon. I have already started some very simple data sets from Kaggle just to practice to use matplotlib. 
I am good at Math but I have not tried any algorithm class, what would you recommend if I stay with Python? Also what are some good kaggle datasets you would recommend to practice with machine learning or data visualization skills?
Hey!
I just completed kaggle micro-courses till deep learning.
I want to work on a project with someone more advanced than me.
Can anyone include me in his/her team?
Hey Ken, love your video...and would like to know the background music...
I am a new joiner in data science and was browsing about it and stuff. Saw your video, click on it, subscribed, and shared with friends.
Dear Sir, I have done my bachelor degree in Arts background ( English Literature), but school and higher secondary was in Science field. I want to build up my future studies and career in Data Science. I have asked a lot of people around me but didn‚Äôt get any appropriate answer whether I am eligible for learning Data Science from scratch or not. My aim is to do MS in DS and try to get funding for post doctoral program too. I‚Äôm also not sure whether US universities will allow me for this since I have no bachelor degree in Science or Engineering. It would be really a pioneering suggestions for me if you give me your valuable advice regarding this. Thanks for reading my comment. Hoping to hear from you soon.
Solid
Thank you very much :)
Hello there! I am an incoming college freshman taking up BS Management Information Systems, do you think can set me up on the right path for data science?
am soo glad i found this when i was beginning my data science journey.. i am a physics major trying to venture into data science.. Thanks @Ken Jee
Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn:
---------------
1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins)
---------------
2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape.
2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library.
---------------
3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development
---------------
4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work.
---------------
Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed:)
Hi Ken Jee, it's my first time here in this channel. Thanks for sharing your data science journey and giving good advice. I graduated from Bachelor in Chemistry, worked in Biology research field (mainly bench work) for >3 years and intending to pursue a Masters in Biomedical Data Science. I would like to ask if learning Python and basic statistics through online courses will be sufficient for me to bridge that gap between wet-lab based research knowledge & skills and data sciences/bioinformatics? I'm unsure if this is the right place to ask about biomedical data science/bioinformatics but I am hoping to receive some advice from a data science expert so that I can better prepare for a field switch. Thank you!
Summer goals 2020
I am in love with you <3
What about SQL?
Thank you for the quality content! Recommended your channel to my friends as well :)
Thanks a lot for sharing.. I am a graphic designer strong with design visual skills frm media background 10 years.. What job profile would be best for me then here to learn????. Also Many industries have age criteria after certain age then dont hire u. How does age factors work here  when a old 45 age fresher works under 25 age experienced person???
I want to swith my career in to AI/machine learning field. I did IBM Data science certification. Can you you please tell which online course should I take next to have practical knowledge. I have learnt basics of python
Hey ! can you upload some videos on how to start and be much familiar with kaggle ? would really appreciate that !
ÏºÑ Î¶¨ Ïß±!
Good starting point. Let me share my experience. I have a master in statistics,  I can code in R, and I have good experience to conceptualize data products. However, I'm still far from a data scientist. There's more about data engineering (getting the data ready) and deployment (platforms, UIs, APIs, servers, containerized, DevOps) that need to be included in my skillset. Your journey shows almost half the way towards data science.

This is for everyone: keep learning new tricks and practicing with real examples.
I had started learning the basics of data science a month ago but had a break due to various works from college ............... I hope i don't break this habit again
Thanks, good video!
I'm a physicist in the last year of my career.  I'm learning python , R and SQL (more python) for do data science  and I'm learning statistical inference and non-parametric statst. I think this are the basics. Then, I want to learn Spark and Hadoop, but what do you recommend me to learn before? I am thinking about docker
Great advice ken! Ill be going for bachelor of data science in the following month and this have been very useful as i wanna prepare before jumping into bachelors . Thanks for the video
Hi. Do I need to start studying data science if I am not a technician (engineer), I don't know python and I have got only basic knowledges in math ?
I would like to develop my python and numpy skills in order to prepare for a masters in data science after my third year of university
Thank you.
Thank u so much for your videos. I'm actually taking the business intelligence business course from data science 365 at udemy. My goal is to finish it to the end of september.

Hey there! I am leaning towards learning Data Science and aiming to do a Master's in the fall next year. I have started gathering information of what I need to study to get a decent clarity on how to start. For accountability purpose, I have started with python language. Will be watching more of your videos! Thanks for the information! ü§ó
more than a minute long intro when the title already tells us the topic about the video.
MIRA MY HOUSE
i learned tableau basics .. dont know python can i get a job ,,though my futuristic plan is complete data science
I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.   

People who learn exclusive via doing‚Äî especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. 

There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.  

The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don‚Äôt know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don‚Äôt know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups‚Äî ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.  

So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.

The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.  

This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.  

Sadly, many of us who don‚Äôt get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don‚Äôt learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,

So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.   

Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. 

Also, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books‚Äî at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.

Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern‚Äî just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit‚Äî let alone intern/apprenticeship training.   

Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average‚Äî and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don‚Äôt migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.
I am learning Data Science on my own. I dont have data science course in bachelors. However I am wiling to do it myself. Keep motivating ‚ù§Ô∏è
no one's talking about the nut button on his desk behind his monitor?
hy ken, thanks for the clip, have been trying to learn data science but still not working. i will be grateful if you could be my data science tutor plssss.... nasver58@gmail.com
Awesome
Hello, im a beginner. I want to learn data scientist. Maybe , any tips for everyone ?
This is such a cool guide. I'm studying data science and psychology at a university and this video is a great overview of what I can do over the summer or during down time in order to increase my knowledge and skill set. Looking forward to future videos!
I'm enjoying Kaggle. I just finished the intro to Python and Machine Learning. It's really beginner-friendly.
Thank you for your video. Can you please post a video on how to prepare for Kaggle Competitions? Thanks.
What is your computer keyboard model?
4:30 lol..someone didnt agree
Thanks for the video it gave me good understanding of how to continue my learning
Thanks for this. I was getting really into Statistics but I realized my time will be better spent doing projects. !
Hi, may I ask how much hours do you normally spend on learning new  data science knowledge  everyday, at the moment?
Thank you for these precious advices üëå
My ultimate goal is to publish at least one article in Journal of Machine Learning Research :) I've even got some ideas, but it would be great to get some help about TeX.
I want to learn python and get better at it by the end of the June. (Since I am already good with CPP) I hope the ride would take up less time
Phew! I met up with a friend of a friend who was saying how much I needed to learn Java if I want to be a professional (software engineer). Which may be true, but I want to pursue data science and I cling to my new python skills. So glad I‚Äôm not wasting my time. I have a goal of building a model that can play chess using deep learning. Wish me luck on my career shift!
I can't say I'm good in math, but I can confidently say I'm not afraid of it. I'm excited.

I want to learn data science but is not from IT back ground and I learn from scratch
Hi Ken Jee, Request you to put more videos on a data science real intermediate level projects. As everyone is talking about projects in ML/DL/NLP but nobody is talking about real life projects in small and medium size industry or free lancers. Not big ones like IBM, Oracle who can spend lot of money to build products. Everyone is talking about titanic, housing price predictions, diabetics ...etc. Looking for new exiting real life projects which we can implement from our home to start testing it. Pl comment and suggest. BTW your videos are awesome. Keep it up.
qwerqwerqwer
This video is interesting in a different way to me. I am Data Scientist, but if I want to start over as a Game Developer.
Thanks for the video! You speak clearly! 

I worked in the Financial world for 10 years. Last year, I signed up for a course of Data Analyst and I loved it so much i decided to change my career and starting from zero. In my own experience, this thing of stablishing goals helped me a lot! I started with an online course of statistics, now i'm learning Python and starting a business project with a friend. Videos like this reenforces the steps we are taking and the path i choosed. Its great help! I will continue watching your videos!

Thanks!
I am really interesting in data science, but unfortunately I'm very bad at math and statistic
is there any chance that I can made it?
This is such an informative video. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. I am interested in learning about Data Science & Finance. Any financial engineers on this channel?
I would like to master Python for finance in the next 3 month.
fantastic video!
I am a studying M.Sc in lighting engineering. I want to be a data scientist. How hard it would be?
Nice video! For a beginner, is it better jumping to data science while learning programming or getting better at software engineering first and going data science thereafter?
hello!! I have a project or idea in mind. It uses the concept of Text Analysis. Can someone here guide me what concepts should I cover before jumping into the project? I have a very basic knowledge of Python. pls help.
With that hairstyle you can Data Science me all night long. 
Lol jk anyways I recently got an internship right after college on data engineering for a financial firm. This had sparked my interest in Data Science in general and thinking of pursuing Master on the subject. Your video is really helpful! Thank you.
I‚Äôm an analyst for telco, however I use sql and power BI to do standard analysis with basic methods. I don‚Äôt have any R or Python experience so where should I start as I want to learn how to create and use models ?
For a beginner, is it ok to focus on Kaggle problems? Or should one explore LeetCode, and other such websites? It all gets overwhelming.
667th comment
This was quite helpful, thanks for posting.
Hello Ken,

I am vivek from India i am right now learning the big data course and wanted to go become a sports analyst can you help me how to go in that field. I have completed my basic python and will be learning all the programming language in my curriculum.
Can you help me in projects like how to build the projects and what kind of books should i read.
Awaiting for your response.
Thanks for sharing knowledge and awaiting for your response.
Thanks for the detailed roadmap, it definitely helps some of us who are looking to pivot to a data science career these days! QQ Do you think a MBP 2017 i5 8gb would be enough to learn and do all of these? Thanks again for these! üôÇ
Thank you so much bro, it‚Äôs very informative especially for someone who doesn‚Äôt any background on Data Analyst/ Science. Most likely I m receiving a lot of negative feedback that it‚Äôs too late for me to learn programming since I m too old. Gosh I‚Äôm turning 30 in few more months, time it‚Äôs ticking need to start soon. Wish me luck, hopefully I could start my journey  and will work out finely then soon  become successful in entirety.
Truly grateful for your insights and advice in this video! It's fantastic. Just wondering, what are your thoughts regarding the 365 Data Science course? Cheers!
Great
thanks friend <3 just finished a BS in economics and I appreciate your insight! especially nowadays it's the best time to reskill!
hey bro,I'm very much afraid of coding, but I want to do masters in data science and now I started learning programming...is it be worthful?
YT algorithm brought me here. Amazing content and advice.subscribed!
Amazing thanks so much
do you think its important to learn data structures and algorithm?
Can someone from Visual arts background pursue data science without a science degree? If yes how must once start ?
what a journey
I like the monitor. Can anyone provide some specs?
how to start as a carrer in Data  Science . ( without college ) , learn online? more knowledge please info
thanks man you are a life saver
Is being good at advanced math really needed to learn Python?
I want to study machine learning and I‚Äôm familiar with Javascript will python be much better or not?
Hey Ken! What IDLE is on 4:45?
A lot of content over the internet about DS was uploaded more than 2 years ago. So sometimes I think that I lost my opportunity to begin DS career.
So the thing that you upload your videos right now is the new light to me.
Thank you
Is data science useful in sports too ??
Thanks for the video Ken! My goal is to learn data science from scratch since I have a lot of spare time at the moment and I'm hoping to move careers somepoint soon.
Thank you for your insight!
Thank you, Ken, this is very helpful!
You seem very driven to self-improvement as well, so will check out those vids as well!
This is an amazing channel. Glad I found it !!. I‚Äôm planning on majoring in data science this fall, thank you for all the videos .
Great video, I wish you make a video how to freelance as data scientist or data analysis for begineers
Hi, I'm about to start a masters in data science in September, this has been really useful!
Great video, gives me some structure to build my studying plan on! As my background is in law, I need to learn and revise some foundations: is there a book you would recommend for revising necessary math?
I am just starting Data Sci and I'm done witu Python but I have a question that many people may have. What fields of Math should I go for? Calculus? Mathematics? Statistics?
Believe me, bro, you will have 1 m subscribers soon, keep going good luck
very interesting video, thank you !
Will a phd in data science add any extra value in my profile than that of a masters student....with respect to industry related job?
wide neck nigga
My goal is to get in silver section at some Kaggle text mining competition this summer. I think it will be a nice part of my resume.
hey Ken - i'm currently working in finance, and I wish to make a career change into data science/analytics. 
I've been told my some friends to complete some Datacamp courses , and then to get a Tableau /Power Bi certificate so that it'll allow me to get a job in the area. 

How do you think i should go about this transition? FYI, i don't have a coding background, so will be learning from scratch.

cheers
hy I need some help in my project about Elasticsearch can you help me ?
Ps : I like the Vedio
Such a helpful video. So glad I could find it.
Thanks for you advice!
I wanna be a good java and C++ programmer for a good foundation.
This channel is going to blow up.
I rarely like videos üëç theses
But üëçfor this
which keyboard are u using?
Wow. Quarintine has made go for Data science from SAP which I am currently  working on(Corporate jobüòÅ). I already started with DS Math skills to just revise what Maths I did during Engg. I also started with Python - everything  from scratch was making it difficult. I watched  one of your videos "Best free courses in DS". That has inspired me to go with what you have shared. Thank you for sharing  your knowledge. Looking  forward  to more videos!!!
This was really helpful. Thank you Handsome Ken.

Many of the data scientists in the industry only use packages that they do not know the math behind or they do not understand the business question that they should solve
I just admitted my offer in Data Science Undergrad. I really like the video
Hi Ken,  
I wanted to ask you as you are sports data Scientist that you could help me to start a career in esports data Scientist. Like what are the requirements? Skills and experience. I am a gaming freak and I want to start a career in data science.
Thanks Ken, Just starting out - great post!
You learned data science in 5 years??? Studying how much hours each day?
hi I am 19 y/o I hope I'm not to late to learn data science
Hey Ken, I am currently pursuing civil engineering (Final year) and planning to do masters in data science. So what advice can you give me before going for it?
I literally was searching for this kinda advice a few days back and so happy I found this video! Thanks for the advice and insights :)
Finally YouTube algorithm got me to the right channel. I found the videos to be informative and thanks for sharing all these valuable links man! Kuddos!
My goal is to push my project to a stage of self sufficiency 1. Data Intake 2. Processing 3. Consistent and manageable output. Able to run forever till the code deprecates (So like 2 years if I'm incredibly lucky)
Hello thanks for your videos . Actually I'm doing intership I'm data science but because of  i m quarantined I should do self effort at home . My question is , all the time I try to watch videos and practice with it . And I did online course but still I feel it's not enough which is true my knowledge not enough to bo data scientist . So what you can advice me to . BTW I will graduate in July for that I'm worry about my knowledge and capacity to look for job . Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
I am starting a MS Statistics this month. I know that many people choose to not get a degree to start a career in data analysis and data science, but I think having the degree will help me land a better job starting out since many positions I have seen have a masters as the minimum qualification. Also, because of the job market right now I don't expect to start working till January of 2021. Your thoughts on this?
ARE you wearing an Oura ring?
Hello!

Just wanted to throw this out there. I am 27 with a degree in Finance and a real passion for technology/programming. I was a comp sci major in community college, but didn't give it the time it needed and eventually switched to finance. I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that I was passionate about which is numbers and programming. I found data science. So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech. I work hard everyday after work to learn more and more about  data science. Any advice/words of wisdom from anybody that has had a similar path as mine?
This is very inspirational man.  And I like the background elevator music too!
Can A person from commerce background with 0 programming background can get to be data scientist. And how?
I think the content of what you're saying is good but the video could be alot better. It's like having a presentation with no slides, it can still work but it's harder to follow as a listener.
I like that this is not an overly technical video and drew me in to DS instead of being scary with loads of terminology
Thanks a lot, it's really motivating !
currently I'm learning randomly, try to catch up with what I don't understand when reading the source code
Excellent video, I hope could followe your advice and the track you propose. BTW, great desk...
Hello from Brazil, i loved your video, i'm trying to use ML(Neural network and random forest) in human body signals.  I want to develop a project that can predict which muscle in shoulder needs a surgery.
My goal is to discover Data Science. By now I am a chemist, and  I don't know how it could be useful for chemistry project, but I am sure there could be a link . Thanks for your videos ! it's super cool ! :)
Finally a video worth watching for...
Keep spam my feed please
I should learn a lot for creating my own model
The actual advice starts at 2:09
Would you do a Document of your experience of how to star?
You‚Äôre literally so cool. I strive to be like you
thanks for the info...I noticed the trackball on your desk ...what trackball are you using?
Ken Jee. Been Following you since you had 10 views on each video. I am SOOOOOO glad you are killing it. I already saw it coming
Thank you so much for coming up with this video! This is definitely impactful! My first video of this channel and hi from your subscriber!
Hi, thanks for the video. I was really looking for this kind of answers. Although I already signed in the 365 data science course in Udemy before watching this.

Just I have a question that terrifies me. Do I need to be a math wizard? Just the word algorithm terrifies me.
I always struggle with numbers, even now I miss the most common and simple operations. 

I'm doing a statistics course in Khan Academy to catch up as fast as I can. But still freak out about it.

What can you suggest? Not to panic? Or focus myself inf hard core maths, statistics, algebra...???

Hope you can answer.
Without real world experience you won't have any credibility. Develop a feel for the data, what's valid, what's not, identify insights, patterns that jump out at you. Then develop a story to convince your stakeholders. Use their language.
I paused the video and read your wall posts and it was amazing. Your channel looks pretty amazing too. I was wondering what capstone projects to work on and I think I'll find an answer within your material. Great job!
Hey Ken, I don't know you, but the algorithm recommended this vid.  I think it is better if you start off with describing a bit about who you are otherwise I don't think the title itself can really grab people's attention because you haven't established validity.  Maybe just something to think about for future vids.
I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?
Thanks very much - really helpful.  I think my goal right now is to figure out what my goal is ;-)
Very good summary of what should assist those on this path. Well done Ken.
Great video. Also, you should make a video about how to style your hair, too :D
It has inspired me a lot! I really recommend this video
https://techiesphere.co/data-science/career-in-data-science-how-to-build-as-a-fresher/
I am a commerce graduate and want to pursue my career in data science but i am not sure if commerce educational background will help me .Do i necessarily need to have a technical educational background to pursue my career in this field ?please help and answer.
...please Ken. "off of" = "on"
This is so helpful. I'm really new to Data Science field. I'm working as an intern data scientist. I don't really have much work at office which is really frustrating. I'm applying to many companies but I'm not able to get into any. Can someone tell me what am I don't wrong?
Thanks for a really informative, helpful video.
Hey Ken have you thought about creating an intensive comprehensive course in Data Science? Lots of courses just teach the concepts but not real-world varied applications with different dirty and challenging datasets?
Project Management 101
Hi Ken,  would you choose studying master in Statistics or Data Science ? If you had to start over
1:15
Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We‚Äôre not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 

2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, ‚Äúalmost no companies know what data science is‚Äù. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it‚Äôs the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That‚Äôs it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I‚Äôm telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 

3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn‚Äôt say data scientist doesn‚Äôt mean your not going to do data science work. I‚Äôm a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE‚Äôs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. 

My job title is NOT data scientist. 

My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of ‚Äúmust know Python‚Äù, it‚Äôs a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don‚Äôt know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn‚Äôt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in Python. Yet they‚Äôre interviewing candidates for Python development. üòÅ

If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. 

Good luck!
Do you just make videos on how to learn datascience, noting some courses and website here and there?
bro your video is extremely helpful and very practical about data science . i got really motivated again in data science .keep up ur work really appreciate your work. thanks
Thanks for video 
What course should a student enrol for degree program that will create job opportunity in data science field.
Should I go for degree in data science or degree in computer engineering? Thanks
Subscribed! I really like how informative your channel is without being preachy. A lot of tech youtubers big themselves up to  a point where you feel you're too late or too shit. Your channel provides useful resources and info. Thanks
Thank you for sharing your wisdom Ken! 
Keep sharing.
Hi Ken, thanks for the insight. Im currently doing a full stack web developer course and after i finish i want to branch out to something different. Data science maybe the option. I have no background in computer science or maths. Would u still think its achievable to accomplish or would it be too difficult of a task? If you think it is achievable, what math do u recommend i start learning? Thank You
Iam  an electrical engineering graduate past out on 2019 and am interested in  data science .I do have programming knowledge in c,c++ .is any job  experience is necessary for this to start learning...
We all know consulting is a fake career.
Love the way he describes getting into this field!
Is a bachelors degree in business analytics a good start in the field of data science if you‚Äôre really bad at maths and know nothing about programming ??
I have statistics bachelor degree but I graduated 7 years ago and I never worked on my major,, basically I don't know anything about it.I'm really interested in Data science these days. I started to learn Python last month, how realistic to be data scientist in one year for someone starting from zero? do you recommend any master about it or online courses might be enough ? Thank you ! I really like your videos please keep sharing with us.
What do you think of the job demand  in 2025-2030? And I'm also concerned about the paying.. is the income good in the data science career? What salary can I expect?
I have certain use cases in mind for diabetology research, would love to have a personal chat on how we can leverage data science for that.
Hello Ken, I am a doctor involved in clinical research and i stumbled upon your channel while trying to understand how to handle large clinical datasets. You are doing a great job of guiding us through data science
My man is stoned.
Hi, great video. I have a question, I hope you can help me
I am reading a few articles about this profession and I saw that the massive job opportunities require an IT graduate? And massive knowledge of statistics, how deep do I need to know about these skills? I am 40 yo a biologist, I got a PhD, but in environmental science...
I don‚Äôt want to spend time and money if the market will exclude me
Can we learn Ml and Ds parallel i am interested in both .
Also give suggestions to learn these feilds online
So glad I came across your channel, this was a super helpful video !
Hello Ken, 
Kindly let me know the best resources for learning  DNN, NLP and CV, which will cover everything from basics to advance. Thanks in advance.
Nice video Ken. In the business of sharing... This guy's stuff is good... Not free but, reasonable.

Keep up the good work.
Helo sir is there any differrance between data science degree and data base mangement degree
My next goal is Kaggle grandmaster!
Damn boi you growing fast lol
Can i learn data science through data science course on coursera
I have just pass my high school. Is data science still be useful and demanding in 2025?
Hey ken!
As a beginner should i learn the fundamentals of machine learning at first Because i know python then i jump to maths?
Do you have a hickey ?
Truly helpful mate, thanks üëçüèΩ
@Ken Jee what is this keyboard that you are using?
Hello  I'm from Japan!
This video was fantastic!!!
My goal is to lead the Japanese DS world and make the world great!!!
In your opinion, is a certified bootcamp a good way to go if available?
Data science makes my head hurt. I wish I ran into your video when I was still in school. I literally graduated TODAY!
The thing I really like about your video is the stress on getting stuck into projects. I am a few months into learning about Machine Learning, but it is only since I started focusing on actually doing projects that I actually feel like I am beginning to understand what is going on. Before, I was focusing on programming, algebra, statistics, and I felt like I was just going through the motions, but now that I started trying to do the projects its like I am waking up and finally learning. Wish I had gotten stuck into projects much sooner.
You forgot the step where you learn the basic concepts of data science and machine learning.
"Basic statistics" won't cover that, and copying code you found on Kaggle without understanding why things are done that way is a good way to pick up some terrible habits. Like not understanding overfitting, for example.
Thank buddy ! It surely helps
I want to become more familiar with R this summer
Hi Ken,
I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.
What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me.

Thanks!
Hi everyone. I am graduating from college this year with an economics degree. I have about a year of experience working as a data analyst (MySQL, Stata, R, Python proficient). Since startup recruiting has been a bit tricky because of the virus, I want to use the next few months while I am unemployed and living at home to become more proficient in higher ML techniques.
Hi ken, i dont have a background in mathematics and statistics but i am a SAS programmer. Can i become a data scientist?
Hi, I am from technical support background with 4 years of experience. Can I start learning data science now? 
Does it helps to my carrier enhancement.
Is Computer hardware & Instruction set architecture necessary before starting to learn Data science ?
It‚Äôs great to be able to watch and listen to  someone who‚Äôs gone through what you‚Äôre currently trying to get through! I‚Äôm also going to do a 2nd masters (in Business Analytics) starting in the Fall and I‚Äôve been trying to get a lot of practical experience via personal projects and some really good online resources from Coursera and Dataquest. It‚Äôs pretty cool to get reminded of the big picture like this and I look forward to watching the rest of your videos and new  releases! Thanks for the awesome content and for providing clarity to those in pursuit of their dreams!
Hi K, thank you so much.. I have longing to learn data science, the problem was where to start .. Your advices are on point.. At least now I know where to start.. Thank you üôè
Do well in my summer data science research project
I have a background in Business and I am trying to understand Python but since I don't have the background in the technical side and I am finding it difficult. Thanks for the information, I think I am familiarizing myself with Python.
I was very interested in Machine learning and data Science.
I would like to see all your videos. They may help me to achieve my goal. Please do many videos that encourage and guide the beginners.
Thanks üòä
Thanks for the video, very reassuring. Please can you recommend any free statistics for data science courses? Would really appreciate it.
can i self learn data science if my math is incredibly bad? (like grade 2-3 standard)
Thank you for sharing your experiences, and recommendations if you did it all over.  I just started my journey to Data Science, and have been studying from the ground up to prepare me for a pricey Data Science bootcamp this summer.  I'll definitely be all over Kaggle, and try my own projects!
Hi Ken, great video sharing your advice!
I've started learning Python for some time now, but there is still so much more to learn.
I don't even know what data science is
I want to start out as analyst for supply chain or industrial engineering in general. Should I be starting out in R or python ?
Your channel is like gold needle inside of haystack
:)
I see this is what Kylo Ren does in his spare time.  Teaching data science.
How much time the one should practice in a day???
I am now 32 can i learn ? And Can  I do data science job?
Im 10 views away from 69,420 views feels bad man
Subscribed 7 minutes into. Really insightful. :D
This is such a helpful video, you are great!! I have subscribed
I am a physics phd student and i also work a full time job, i knew programming would be someting i will love and master since we first got introduced to pascal 7 years ago and matlab and fortran later( that's all we learned, but it gave me the basics) , so now i want to learn Data science for my phd work ( i could just use a software that everyone else use at the lab to analyse and visualise my experimental data) and also to have a job as a DS too, it's perfect now with the quarantine i have more then enough time to learn.

So, do you think i can learn DS in 3 months?i learned python the last two weeks it's easy but i didn't build any projects yet.  

I love your channel, thank you loads üôèüôè
Man the background music is so chilling.
Started my first EDA
Datacamp is the resource I‚Äôm using
Hi Ken!
Great video, you gained a subscriber here.
I like more books rather than videos but I will definitely try kagel.


At this moment I'm learning R and I'm following these books that I picked:
Practical Statistics for Data Science; (read)
R for Data Science; (read)
Introduction to Statistical Learning with R; (read)
Elements of Statistical Learning; (on it)
Advanced R; (next)


Any books you recommend to fill some gaps here?


Thanks!
7:02 to get motivated !
How is towardsdatascience course?
I already know python I have some basic knowledge of statistic and different library used for data visualisation

nowhere is my main question of how I can train myself to professionally become a data scientist, I tried udemy courses but they were basic I want to learn things that are practically used

I did my graduation in computer science engineering so I know how to write code and all
I like it!

Trying to figure out by learning introductory course in Data Science that, what I wanna do in this field.
Need a over view of Data Science.
Hi everyone. I recently decided to try to learn python and ML by myself. Although I have a career in finances, I have a lot of boring repetition in my work. My goal is to understand enough in the next 6months to 1 year so I can move into more of a financial data analyst. I‚Äôll provide updates every month or so :)
I will become a Data scientists & Full stack web developer & entrepreneur
Can you give any recommendation of a website where I can practice python as a beginner
My goal is to deploy a model by the end of this year
Hi Ken, this is a great video. I appreciate you taking the time to talk about this topic in depth. If I heard correctly, you said it took you five years to get to where you are today. Can you shed some more light on that? During the last five years were you working as a data scientist/analyst, or is this something that you pursue in your spare time? 

I am wondering because I am trying to transition into a career related to data science. Specifically, I would to work in a role related quantitative research in the finance industry. I have been studying ~20 hours/week the last six months, and on and off the previous six months. I have been using resources such as Datacamp and Quantopian to practice and learn. However, it is frustrating that I am at the level that I would like to be at, and I am beginning to wonder if getting a masters degree in data science or financial engineering would be the better route. I would love to get your opinion on self taught vs. traditional education.
Ken, I really liked this video. This is my first visit to the channel. I've been setting data science learning goals and I've been doing it at an intense pace for about 6 months now. This video was very important to me as I was able to review my goals and check if I'm going the right way. It seems that I need to get my hands on real projects and show what I can and can't do. Always learning. Thanks.
I‚Äôm a data science student. Currently studying data science for my masters. I read mechanical engineering for my bachelors and honestly it has been very hard understanding everything. That aside the system for my academic calendar doesn‚Äôt do much to support good self study so I‚Äôm still a beginner at everything although I‚Äôve been doing fairly well with my assignments. This makes it hard for me to present myself to companies because immediately they see you‚Äôre about to be a graduate with an Msc. in data science, they expect the most from you which is fair but then to someone like me who had zero background in this course before starting, it is quite intimidating. It makes me wonder if there‚Äôs ever a company out there who will have the patience to allow me to grow in my knowledge whiles still contributing to the job requirements.
Hello! I am creating videos about data science application for business. Feel free to suscribe to my channel if you are interested in this topics :D
I dont have a cs degree and dont know coding can i do data science
So cool to see someone with the same background as me (eerily so). Although you‚Äôre a few years ahead
I'm a sales professional and I would like to learn data science course.
Hey man do you have any contact details which you can share? I would really like to ask something privately.
Amazing video , who even disliked it? not me haha I hit the like button. I COMPLETELY SMASHED IT
Yooo liked your video! I am an economics student, and I am thinking of minoring in Data Science. Would you recommend it?
I was also thinking about same thing
Lol I have to view all his videos to understand this video....
Great videoüëçüèª
Hello Ken. I am fresher graduate. I want to strat learning data science from scratch. So from where i should start??
Sir, At what age were u a professional data scientist?  Just curious xD
7:00 
I see you keeping up with your subs goals. Good job! Let me contribute one as well.
I just studied Pandas properly.
Is there any website where i can test my knowledge?
Just pandas related quiz or questions....
Please let me know
He is one of those good youtubers that people subscribed after watching one video
please recommend me agood laptop for data science?
I've started learning data science through book.should I continue this way for few more month or should I try something else
Hi Ken jee. Happy to have bumped into your channel. In your opinion, do you think is crucial for data scientist to learn about flask or django?
the projects done by people on kaggle seems to be very intimating (with long analysis) and some coding i do not understand....
Great vid man, thanks. If we are struggling to land a data science role, do you think being a data analyst for a period of time would be a good stepping stone to landing a DS job?
My goal is to learn the basics of machine learning and data pre processing in 6 months!
Sir I'm from India I recently started my path toward data scientist.I want to buy a laptop.My maximum budget is $500-$600.What specifications are important as a beginner and I can also use it for the task.
I'm asking you because you have a experience.Everywhere I seen people suggest about expensive laptops but now can't afford that much of price.Please Suggest me a good laptop in my budget.
Nice overview! Great idea to show folks how to get started. I‚Äôm aiming to bring more into the space of Master Data Management in Healthcare.
Hi Ken, My main goal in the next 3 years to become a proficient data scientist. Because I recently only discovered my passion for data science and I did my bachelor's in Urban planning. Now I have to learn quickly all the concepts and be competent in applying those into real-world problems which I am sure I can. But my only worry is to get an entry-level job in the data science field since I don't have any paper qualifications or experience from my current job. Any tips on that how I could land a new job in this field to gain experience?
I would start by not learning it and start learning software engineering. Data scientist  are looked down in the tech industry. Any software engineer can do their job but it is boring as hell. Apart from that, your end product is nothing but a power point or report showing your results. Who would feel proud of that?
Your favorite coder is Gilfoyle i guess. You talk like him LOL.
Video starts from 1:15
Hi, Is it mandatory to be a software developer if I want to work in ML? in other word, are all ML engineers are software developer? I am an EEE person interested in ML. I know C, MATLAB and python but i don't have any idea about frontend or backend web development as well as software development. So, for me will it be wise to spend time learning ML?
my goal now is to learn DATA SCIENCE in the course of next 6 months
Hello Kane! Please guide on the exact course & skills to be acquire & relavent topics one can study to become Data analyst (Specific this component only) for non programming individuals only.
I can't see any crisp content or precise topics one should master.
For eg - How much & which type of modules in python for Data analysis.
What topics in Statistics for Data analysis.
What depth in SQL and so on & the list is long.
So please throw some light.
Your monitor has a TN panel and doesn't support wide viewing angles. I'm guessing that this is for a reason. What reason could that be?
I 120% agree with the part "you go practice first and see if theory fits it". This is exactly how I would advise to other jr. data scientists that I train.
Love the intro!! Awesome video :)
Data science is a very vast field. Everyday I feel I know nothing and have a lots to learn. Thanks for the video. It is really helpful.
I am an IP consultant, I develop interest in Data Science during this lockdown, my goal is to become a good data analyst by Jan 2021...do you think it is realistic?
What wide monitor do you have ?
Ken, thanks for all of the informative advice. Do you think your Masters in Commerce which lead you into a analyst role provided you any significant foundation for programming/data science? Also, is the switch from data analytics to data science difficult?
Such videos are made by people who want to earn money while trying to become a Data Scientist.
I'm having hard time learning data structures and algorithms in python... Any suggestions to accelerate learning process..
Hello Ken, I love your videos, thanks so much for it! Do you use SQL in your projects? In other videos usually the people recommend start by SQL due the amount of data, what do you think?
Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes. Cheers
sick new intro
Hey Ken, 
Thanks for valuable info.


A quick Q&A can / should data science learn online as you know lots of video will be find here of 11 hrs to 15 hrs learning OR need to go through proper channel of learn like enroll in paid classes with renounced institute 


What's your opinion ?
You rock Ken
Great video as usual , Thanks Ken
on my first day i studied for too long well about 5-7 hours, I just finished watching and i did burn out and didn't go back to work for 2 days, i felt exhausted.
Im just starting with programing like from the very very beginning, I've already been using the nba.api but i want to know what else can i do with that to learn more. I want to be a statistician in my future. Any Tips? Thanks for your videos they are helping. Ive also purchased Mathletics and its very good!!!
First of all a huge thanks to you for bringing this exclusive content for us!
If you could, can you review the curriculum of this Data Science MSc programme. ( https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/datascience/#tab=structure )
I have an offer for this programme and I'm from a computer science background with minimal stats knowledge.
I need to build a distributed recommendation system for an e commerce to improve the UX from reatilers and servieces in my country. Features would be: 
from consumers perspective:

-Recommendations of alike products
-most vieew products such as you search
-processing text from a written list of products and searching the data base for those prodcuts
-users personalize input to search for best fit ..question for this woudl be; what categoriy of product you would like to buy? (this could be on or varous catergories), Do you  want the lowest to the highest price or you dont care?, do you want the nearest to the fardest location? ansd so on 
from retail perspective:

- profille of users
- goal clint 
- setting of weekly and monthly  goals
- reocomendation of which products to buy from markets feedback
- recommendation of products to buy from two alike products (based on demand, profit/cost, and snetiment of consumers about the product)
- sentiment analysis from consumers to products of the retailer
- sentiment analysis from consumers to overall perfomrance of retailer
-data visualization
and son on....Anybody could help me on gettin started about recomemndation systems? :)
Awesome video Ken. I'm about 1 month in so far. I enrolled in data science 365. Definitely filled in the gaps of my learning.
Hi Ken, can you do a desktop set up video to maximise productivity? :)
Python with their libraries...
Thank you for the informative content!!! Helped a lot
New goal for Ken: Use rule of thirds in videos.
Sweet, right on time. I'm a Mech. Engineer just got my first job as an engineer, but I've lost total interest for it. Data science might be the career for me.  Thanks for the tips.
Good luck to everyone thinking of a career change or those studying! We got this!
Liking your new intro and B-roll!! Thank you so much for the advice.
Dataquest does a good job of covering all that in one place aside from personal projects though they do have projects. It‚Äôs been worth the money.
I'm currently finishing up law school between now and July (when I have to submit my thesis). Between now and the end of August though I would like to get through the 365 intro to stats course, 365 Python programming course, as well as 365 Data Science course. I do have to be extremely careful of burnout as you pointed out. However, I am extremely motivated to make this transition into Data Science. There's a Data Science bootcamp here in Toronto that I'm keen to attend which I'd hope to start in October. I'd like to go into that Bootcamp with a solid base, as most of the attendees in the Data Science stream seem to have solid technical experience.
Thank you for providing your insights its always good to have some guidance from the people already in the domain.
Hey Ken! Thank you for all your videos. I was wondering if this changes any for people pursuing sports analytics. I was also wondering how to start with projects for sports analytics. I am currently 16 years old and am trying to learn coding and statistics during this time through free edx and coursera, but I still don't seem to be able to do any projects, especially ones that are new and intuitive. I want to publish new work, but over summer if I am only good enough to do projects that maybe others have done, is that still worth publishing? Thank you for any advice.
What course did you mentioned in Machine Learning?
Love your content buddy.. i wanted to know what are your thoughts on IBM data science course offered by Coursera because i have undertaken this course and many others have as well... i just wanted to know where will it take me
Merci from France :)
Ken, do you have any sport analysis resources that you can recommend?
Thanks Ken for a great video on the roadmap of learning data science! The intro animation graphics looks awesome!
Well said, accountability indeed helps to keep us motivated and pushing it to meet the goals we set. Being accountable for one another in this comment community is surely a great way to move forward in learning data science together. üòÄ
Hey Ken, could you do a project from scratch that would involve feature selection, feature scaling, PCA, data normalization etc. I did see your series of Data Scientist job positions from scratch but would like to know how the above concepts are incorporated in the project. Thanks.
Really insightful
thank you for this video! would you recommend coursera courses? im studying IBM's data science courses rn and i wonder if these certificates help me to get data science internship or make a project
Love the new intro Ken !! 



Definitely agree with staring projects as soon as you can. I spent too much time learning about functions and things I could do but constantly forgot them because I was never doing projects and applying them. Alot of my time was spent learning things but I never knew when or how to apply them because I never did projects at first!
Firstly, thanks for sharing your knowledge !  I live n Brazil and I'm graduate in Computer Engineer, recently signed a premium plan on DataCamp and I'm enjoying it.
I discovered 365 Data Science by your recommendation at the start of this pandemic. Their videos are highly informative and involve very detailed projects that will help you understand key concepts, as well as open the door for you to start making your own types of projects through what you will have learned. So, I definitely recommend them as well.
Goal is to learn the basis of ML in the next 6 months. I'm going to come back to this comment
Hello Ken, 
If you could you suggest the order in which a person should learn ML algorithms? 

I would be very gratefull to you. 
Thanks
Very helpful... thankyou for dedicating your precious time to guide beginners like me.. :)
Hey Ken, just wanted to show some support to you. All your videos are super helpful and fun to watch. Keep up the good work! :)
That new intro of yours does look really cool, I have to say! :D
I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years.
Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years.
My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers,
more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really
commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do.
Have a nice weekend :)

Hey ! All I want to say is... THANK YOU!  You have been mentoring me for quite some time now!
Hi Everyone - While editing this video, Vishnu said it was fine to use his name etc. (why his info is not blurred on his github). Special thanks to him for letting me do this! Vishnu's github can be located here: https://vishnubharadwaj00.github.io/. If you would like me to review your resume, projects,  or portfolio, please let me know in the comments below and send the information to kenjee.ds@gmail.com!
Thanks for the content
Amazing analysis/ Honest feedback Ken... Can't wait for your video on "Building your personal website"... üëç
Great tip about putting accomplishment then method! Subscribed; keep it up!! I like the 4k upload too!
Please refer to this playlist about resume and project improvements: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek
I'm not sure about this, but I think you have to try to change scenes and sometimes have just daily stuff like making coffee or something. Because for me it's a little bit boring to always watch on talking pretty guy. Yeah, but your content is great, keep going <3.
Great stuff as usual! I hope you will do one I will make in the future :) Do you have any tips on data science forums? I have a great python forum, but its more towards web, dev, ets. But really helpful bunch :)
Amazing content! Waiting for your tutorial on how to build a website and host it on Github. Thank you!
Awesome video picked up on a couple of things I never would have guessed. Also, the personal website through github is something I'd defintely look forward to seeing.
Cheers!
I really like how you stress the important parts and flesh out the points with bits of practical explanation like you did with the resume layout or the documentation.
This really is good advice and definitely a resource a lot of people who are not incredibly experienced in the field can benefit from.
I don't have a lot more to say than just the fact that I enjoyed watching it and thank you for the helpful insights!
Really like this kind of series! Definitely helpful for  the aspiring data scientists.

How about a video on how to build a personal portfolio website??
Hey Ken, great video as always! 

Would it be possible for you to make a video on some examples of technical interview questions? I was looking through your channel and couldn't find such videos. Hope this is not too much to ask for..

Thanks!
great video ken...
Ken, Great video and insights on preparing a strong resume! Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects. Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub, Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) is a great tool, it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github.io. Best of all, there's a large selection of themes to select from. Personally, I use it to create our research group's website http://codes.bio/
Hi Ken. This video was very helpful. I would really appreciate the video idea you mentioned of how to build your own website on Github. I have one on Wix but I think having one on Github would be better. Thank you
Thank you for continuing the series.
I have a question lets just suppose I have done 3 or more online courses regarding data science, what do you recommend putting on the courses sections all the courses of some specific. If some specific one then how to choose which one.
Thanks in advance.
Another awesome video. :) Would you make a video going over LinkedIn tips?
Hi, Ken. What do you mostly do at work? Build models, clean data or something else?
3:38-Show clear interest in the company be eager to learn
Hey Ken, I actually managed to land my current data science internship because of this video! Extremely helpful, thank you! :)
Just curious,  if interns get paid, what salary should we expect?
I don't have any degree but I have better knowledge of Data Science And AI and I have  unique projects.How can I apply for an internship ? Cuz most of them requiere at least Bachelor's.Thank you
Sir I got selected for data scientist internship.in that  internship  they will calculate performance evaluation ... please give me some suggestions sir.. what are courses are most useful for data scientist job
This was so helpful thank you so much üôèüèª
Great tips for internships.  Apparently youtube algorithm has mastered the timing of video suggestion for me. I will be starting to apply for internship in month of August. Thanks Ken for making videos on internship topics too.
Thanks for the video.... Finally, I started  66daysofdata and will also start the project from scratch series...
I do have the basic skills..I have started the application..and will keep all this in mind..Will update when I land an internship
Hi Ken, I have worked for more than 10 years outside of data science or software field. My background is Material Science. I see that project experience seems quite important for job application. Is internship useful for people like me?
liked and subscribed Thanku
Hey Ken, I am a really big fan of all of your content and you have truly inspired me to enter the field of data science and sports analytics. I am an incoming college freshman (math major)and I have been learning SQL and python through code academy. Other than projects, do you have any tips to make myself stand out in order to get an internship? I hope to intern with the Los Angeles Lakers analytics team and I could really use some advice. Your videos and website(playing numbers) are the most helpful resources related to the field that I have been able to find, keep up the great work!
I'm moving to Munich with a maths degree statistics and programming knowledge. Its nice to see this video to remind me that i don't have to be an expert to get an internship. Thanks Ken, your videos as very informational and motivating.
Thanx
This was really useful! many thanks. I just have one question:
how would you recommend me to include a previous experience in developing a business in my CV? Thanks a lot again!
Great advice! I hate interviews, and really don‚Äôt look forward to them. I choke and get really stressed. I perform better when allowed to produce something rather then answer on the top of my head :)
Great video!
Generally I think the younger someone is
(or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education)
the more impressive extraordinary projects become.
If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst 
collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year.
Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool
projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible.
With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these
uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more,
especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today
they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on.
Nevertheless, great video! I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year(s).
Hey Ken, great video as always. Curious to hear your thoughts on the Spyder IDE as I saw it being used in this video. Any standout reasons you use it over Jupyter/VSCode/etc?
Hey Ken, thanks for the great video. I have been watching all your videos and they are greatly helpful! I have a question though. At 2:04, you mentioned that "if you want to set yourself apart, you should consider doing unique projects on the dataset you personally collected." Are there any efficient ways I can collect new dataset?
Hi, Ken. Thanks for sharing helpful tips! I wish I found your advices in earlier years in college. I‚Äôm a new graduate without any intern experience. Can you give me an idea of how I can find research opportunities at this point? Thanks in advance!
Thanks for the tips! I had planned a astronomy / machine learning internship at a university in PA for the summer. The program has since been cancelled due to COVID :( But luckily, I applied to a data science intern position at a startup and got it :)
Thanks your share, i'm a 2nd  software engineering student but i want to become a ds in the future. I'm really not good in math, can you give me some advice, sir?
This video inspired me to look into internships for this summer, something I wasn't planning on doing because I didn't think I was qualified. Thank you for asking!
Helpful videos! Keep up the great work!
Mr. Jee you vedios are really helpfull
Sir. I am 2nd year engineering student and I wanted to explore data analysis in sports field please guide me
Sir please make an video of Complete Sports  data analysis based project from scratch
Hi Everyone! If you are interested in having your projects, portfolio, or resume reviewed in a video please let me know in the comments below! Also, send an email to me at kenjee.ds@gmail.com with a link to your project, resume, etc. Again, please only send in to the email if you are comfortable with having your work reviewed on video.
I really like the Notebook Viewer idea.  makes it very simple to follow through with code.  I've just tried it out for the first time at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ 
seems simple enough, just copy and paste url of the notebook you want to be used.
Hey Kan Lee I am doing a project like foodcouver, but I created a scrapper for various websites. As a result I have thousands of text reviews and ratings. Do you think it is good for a project to mention how did I got the data but no which websites I used? My goal is a recommendation system with aggregated data, of course free. But I am afraid that some of the websites may not like this idea. How am I supposed to scrape if many websites restringe their use? I would like to know what do you think
Thanks!
Sir I sent you mail with attachment of my resume and GitHub link, I request you to kindly review my resume and GitHub profile
This is one of the very valuable channels in Youtube. Thank you!
This is awesome. I‚Äôm starting out learning programming for data analyst (Udacity data analyst course). I have my bs in mechanical engineering and am a process engineer for a Pharma company. So, going through my own course work and seeing other people‚Äôs work with your explanation is very beneficial. Thank you!
I really like this idea. Please do more of these. Maybe I'll send my resume too once I am done with my projects. :D
Hi Ken, love your channel and reviews. I got few couple of DL projects posted on my github https://github.com/McDo, and also I've created a little webapp that helps to explore similar clothes on instagram using tensorflow.js. https://aidope.com . I'll be glad to have reviews from you, if you are interested.
This is great, Ken. I'll be sharing some of my projects with you once I get a hang of git
This a cool idea should do one once a week
hey ken can you do a video about the types of data science/data analytics software we should be familiar with for beginners
So happy you decided to start this series Ken. For those of us who are already getting hands-on with our own projects (hopefully most of us), this is going to be a monumentally helpful series! I unsubbed just so I could sub again haha
Super Helpful . Please do these kinds of videos.
Very nice video üëåüëåüëåüëå

Love it. Keep up the great work.
Great hands-on tips and insight, thanks kenüëç
Hey Ken,
(warning: longer comment incoming)
I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking
"Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel",
but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard.
It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science
and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going
and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering).
I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system
including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel.
With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources
and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub
is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort
into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%.
I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community
and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping.
If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather
on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this,
recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau!
I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)
Super helpful, would love to see more of these. I've been having trouble on how to get my repositories get to the next level. This video really is a great reference on where to go. Thanks Ken.
Would love to see more such videos. Thanks
Great new video series on project review, Ken
Nice video Ken!!
Please refer to this playlist about resume and project improvements: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek
Really cool! üëåüèª
Thanks for watching everyone! The best part of my day is usually getting outside or exercising. What is your favorite part of your routine?
Not at 10,000 
(Now has 136k) :)
Congratulations on hitting 80K (and growing) subscribers. Have you now altered your goal viewing from the traffic/analytics on your channel?
This seems like the kind of top-tier job you would get in silicon valley. I'm from the midwest US and really want to see the more mundane and less glamorous jobs that are out here, since I don't want to leave behind my family and friends and life in indiana to chase a dream job. I know someone who works as a data analyst for CANON and a lot of his work is SQL queries and relational databases and excel spreadsheets. Don't get me wrong -- your job looks amazing -- but it looks really competitive (like 200+ applications per job for these sorts of things) and something that would be near impossible with my background in the humanities.

edit: You know, I just re-read this comment and it sounded rude. So let me just say that I do really appreciate your content and videos!! :-)
wanted 50k by the end of the year but you're already at 75k! seems like you might get to 100k by the end of the year!
Hey Ken, big fan! Would you be interested in a colab? First time creator, and I just started making videos a month ago. You're an inspiration! Leave a comment anywhere on my channel, and let's make something happen!
Hey! What kind of data science IDE is what? Is that something like Spyder or Rodeo?
Hi Ken!
It would be very helpful to review data science course contents of colleges and institutions.
Congrats on 50K subs.. much earlier than expected!
Hi Ken! I have a question for you: do you (or your colleagues) often work overtime? Are you getting paid for that time? I‚Äôm from Russia and working extra time without getting paid here is a normüòí Curious to know what the situation is across the oceanüôÇ
shout out to intermittent fasting and morning coffee! üòõ
Shoutout UIC. Alma mater looking barren.
Hi Ken. Thanks for sharing!
Congrats on  hitting 50k sub goal! Youre awesome. Really enjoy learning from your channel
First time watching your content. And I have to say, these are not tutorials but they are!
What music are you using for the transitions in your videos? It's pretty groovy!
can being a introvert will effect the data scientist??
I really like how you post your goals on the walls!! Did you have morning and evening routines up there too? I've been cultivating morning routines for several years now and really feel the benefit from them. You seem so organized! Would you maybe do a video on how you track your goals in the excel spreadsheet? Thanks for the interesting video!
You should try notion to track uour goals and for productivity, it's great!
beautiful video ken
Hey Ken! Would you say that the typical workday of a data scientist is quite isolated? I love the concept of data science and statistics, but I am also a very social person and am worried that becoming a data scientist will cause me to have an unhappy work life (e.g. constantly sitting in front of a computer the entire day, not enough interaction, etc). Please let me know your thoughts, and thank you once again for all of your content!
How much time do you use on your channel a week?
Let's hit that 50k mark!!

Looks like you need a haircut haha. Enjoyed watching what your day looks like!
Man you‚Äôre doing a great job! I just found your channel and found it very interesting with decent amount of insightful contents that I will look into. Cheers and keep it up! Subscribed. Im beginning my Data Scientist journey
what is your monitor model ? lol
Bruh. 15 min increments?!
Hope you enjoyed tikka Indian spicy
Thats how Indian dishes are
Bro you are really good at it      50k is a cake!!!!
someday that discord link will exist, maybe it might be the best data science discord. who knows?üòÇüòÇ
Thanks for the great content Ken!  You're the DS YouTube GOAT.  Keep it coming.
Yo what ide is that at 6:44 ?
Great video. Very interesting!
Lol mine is wake up, go to work, come home throw a pc at the wall, sleep, and repeat...also I‚Äôm from Chicago üèÄ
What breed is your dog? Imma guess and say box terrier.
Hey ken! Great video as usual. Gotta watch your DS project series for tomorrow.
Thanks Ken for sharing your day, you have a good disciplined routine, and awesome video editing. Liked the YouTube goals, if you don‚Äôt mind, how did you forecast the numbers? üòÉ
making time for that physical activity is so important. I definitely gotta work on that a little more.
I relate a lot with this video, the Excel goal thing , al the paper in the walls in the room. Nice video ! A lot more personal
It was an honor to present this information to almost 100 Kellogg MBA students. If you have any questions about the topics, please leave them in the comments section below! Also, a link to my website playingnumbers.com is in the description.
How much a sports data analyst can earn?
Are we talking contested shot slightly contested, open, or just all shots from that rang. Seems like the numbers can change dramatically based off this info.
Hey, Ken. Thank you for sharing your journey and experience. It is really helpful for me. I have a couple of questions.

As you used to play Gold and Baseball and you have more knowledge about Basketball. I am a guy who played mostly Cricket from my childhood and some sports which I sometimes play and watch are badminton, hockey, car, and bike racing.

So Which is a better choice for a person like me. Should I try to apply my skills in games like baseball or Basketball or is it better to go ahead with the games which I played till now?

Would you like to share your thought on this topic? Which sports should one choose while entering into sports analytics?
Hey ken, I have been watching your videos for at least 1 hour a day the past week and I love the content. I‚Äôm 19 and am beginning my journey towards my career in data science/sports analytics and your content has by far been the best I‚Äôve come across. I was wondering if there was an email that I could contact you with? Or would you prefer Lengthy YouTube comments instead? Either way, thanks again for the free content it‚Äôs very appreciated.
Hello there, I have a question. I know next to nothing about maths but are you taking in consideration the fact that Shaq has two separate shots or free-throws, while Steph only has one shot?
Let's think about a coin toss example, the probability to land heads twice is equal to 1/2*1/2=1/4, so let's say Shaq has a 50% success rate at shooting freethrows wouldn't it be 0.25*2 his expected buckets?
Fascinating. I could listen to this for hours. Had no idea analytics was involved in recruiting. Would love to hear more about how you might help a team develop strategies on how to beat a specific opponent. I appreciate what you sent me on LinkedIn a month or so ago, but I'm very behind on my reading.

"My friends would say that I was absolutely delusional."  HaHa
This is really cool, and a great insight to what you do and how you do it. Love the variety of video topics while staying within Data Science.
Awesome talk, Ken! Great insight on the 2000 vs 2019 shot range! Also great insight on the AI-augmented human intuition. Learned a lot on sports analytics, thanks!
Thanks for watching! Let me know down here in the comments section the biggest thing you are struggling with when WFH!
I think you should start making Fitness motivation videos as well üòÅ.
Can I use a mirror to keep myself watched? 
As always thanks for your tips. I started WFH a few days back and I will try to implement most of your guidelines...
Thoroughly enjoying your videos man! I've taken a dive into data science the last 3 months with a similarly circuitous path: eventual Econ major --> actuary --> tech at big 4--> currently applying for MS in DS... Sensing that I've stumbled upon a treasure trove of know-how here
Thanks Krish, KenJee and Data Professor for your time for sharing the knowledge.  All the very best for the  krish for his new Assignment :)
Thanks for the tips Sir, i have just completed Data Science course and was looking around how to begin my career to apply in real life, and I stumbled upon your video the how would you start your Data Science career. After watching your video it helped me a lot, it has changed my mindset. Thanks for helping the community God bless you, please keep posting.
I'm a work from home data scientist. Just started this year. Thanks so much for the tips and suggestions. Definitely will give them a try. 

My coworkers work in a different time zone, and so I have to adjust my schedule to match theirs. However, that's a struggle in of itself as it means late days (even though I start late). Any suggestions on how I can remedy this? Thanks!
Scheduling the entire day and putting my phone away in a separate room are tips that I will try this week!


Thank you Ken!
These are great tips for me since I myself work from home. Also, the two articles you listed in your description are eye-opening to me!
Ur videos are amazing. Just getting started into Data Science and your channel is a god's gift to me. Keep up the good work !!!!
Absolutely loving the B-roll!!
Great vid! Another tip I would add is get dressed like you are actually going into the office?
Thanks Ken for the work from home tips, agree with you that a dedicated work space helps to boost productivity. What also works for me is a good background music as a sort of white noise (helps to be in the zone).
I have been working/Studying form home for 4 years. And first 4 points you have mentioned is what I already follow.
I have worked and studied from home for many years, and agree with you on 1, that one is Key, separate the roles.  2 is not that easy I find it. I usually don't have much downtime before it did for the day, but 5 minutes here and there when needed. But I do make a prioritized task list. 3. I have turned off all notifications except SMS and phone calls :) 4. I have my "big break" as a workout in the garage around mid-day. 5 is also a great tip. 6..... Yeah! no progress for me, haha!

You did not as for my opinion, but I wanted to share to point out that even though we don't do the same things, our goal is structure :)
Thank you so much i did it finally . It took 2 weeks to complete whole code from scratch
Great work Ken, the only thing I'd suggest in the technical part to clean up the repo, so we don't end up having binaries, caches... along with the code. Good luck.
This is great ken! Since I was following this series tangentially, I got to learn web scraping, lasso regression, flask and API (you explained that amazingly well), and proper documentation (which i feel is an underrated skill). 

Thank you and hope to see more amazing content! Take care.
This is amazing. The whole journey including hick-ups and subsequent search for the solutions, and final resolutions, explanations, and documentations is just priceless. Thanks for taking time to put this together to help others. Keep it up.
amazing
Thank you for this very well structured project series. As I am new to the DS field, I received many important ideas and insights and you are really a gem ‚ù§
That was really useful!! Thank you! :)))
Thank you! Documentation is so important and one does not often learn about it until it becomes a problem that there is no documentation. This video was really helpful in getting an idea of what is a good documentation practice for a data scientist.
Completed this Awesome project series ‚ù§. This project teach me so many things and motivates me towards Data science.
Thank you Ken
Thanks for the series. You are amazing!
The best compliment I can give to this 4+ hour playlist is... I'm going to watch it again in the near future. It was great -- thank you for putting in the time to make it.
I liked watching all the videos with your in-depth work. What I though was missing is an example of how it work when a user sent the information to the server and how and what information was displayed, the end product that provide information so that the user can make a decision from the data.
amazinggg you're so great ken. Thank you again I've told all my DS homies about you. Thank you!!
Thank you for the series, most transparent I've seen on yoUtube
Thanks this was really heplful to me ! i think i can start documenting my projects now!
Hi Ken! Like everyone else I'm super grateful for this series -- it was so detailed and helpful. I'm a recent university graduate (data science major) and this helped synthesize everything I learned into something actually cool and useful! I'm about to apply for entry level jobs and cannot thank you enough for all the effort you put into this. :)
Just finished watching this project series. It is really helpful to understand the whole process of working on a project. You have done a great job.
What an absolute gem of a playlist. Thank you so much Ken! You are a star
man i finished the project because of u thanks a lot u r my hero
Thank you for doing this whole series. I hope you do another one soon! Your videos are so great for learning
Thanks Ken this project tutorial is great.
I watched all 7 and will be referring to it often! Great work and thanks Ken!
Need this kind of content...PERFECT
Great Playlist, loved it! One feedback would be to focus the screen share on the coding part of Spyder, it is tough to follow because the code is just a small part of the screen.
Hey! I'm learning data science from 3 months and I have completed probability, some part of stats and python, now I'm learning Linear regression and clustering. I have not yet started with the deep learning concepts. But I want to start my project now and build the project along side the theory do u think that is a good idea? Also at this level is it good to start with this series or will I be confused as I don't know many concepts? Also I am self learner so if you would reply it would be of a great helpüòÅ
Great video ! I just binge watched the whole playlist üòç
Just a quick stream question: how do you deal with a super wide monitor and  sharing your screen at normal aspect ratio with OBS ?
It was a journey. I am about to finish my project and I can't thank you enough.  Hadn't I followed this playlist, my final project would be simply a bunch of code that no one would understand.
Thanks again Ken.
Thank you so much Ken. When someone loves the subject and teaches it to others, they will also start loving the subject. With your detailed unedited video, I gained a lot of confidence. I used to get overwhelmed with so many terms but seeing you I understood that not everyone knows everything. You just have to start with an idea and learn along the way by getting your hands dirty. Thank you once again. Have a great day!
Thank u so much for this series, it really gives me a lot of insights^^
This series deserves a Netflix production! Geat job Ken, so helpful !
I loved this series! Thankyou for giving us the time to make this, they're so helpful for people like us, please make more :')
Made it to the last video of the series! Yey! thxs for all this, I was getting anxious because I wasn't sure how to structure and use all the tools I'm getting from the courses/videos/books/etc. in an actual project, and this was really helpful :D
Bloody well done mate!!
Watched this full series. It's a great one. One thing I found when you were correcting hourly to annual wage ,you need to calculate Average salary again . As after doing hourly to annual wage min and max salary got changed.
Thanks
Thanks for the series Ken I really appreciate it! Small detail though, but it looks like the y-axis on the histogram in your EDA is labeled "job_state" when it should be something like "num_job_postings".
Hi Ken wanted to ask if its possible to make an API endpoint that takes in multiple rows or a file and outputs predictions for each row in that file at once
HI, Ken Please make more videos on end to end project like this starting from data collection to documentation
Thank you ken, i never thought i would come this far in data science and you made it much easier to understand.
Hi Ken, really appreciate the time and effort covering the technical aspects of data science as opposed to just a generic theoretical road map suggested by many. Helps to put things into perspective for those keen in this field. Great work btw!
Thank you so much ken for Markdown cheatsheet and for providing all the valuable information through this project whole series finally completed the whole series still facing few problems, error but I will try to solve it...keep making videos like this...best wishes for your channel...Thank you once again!!!!
Learned a lot from this series Ken. Thank you soo much and hope you will add more projects like this in the future. Can you take up a really messy dataset and guide us on the cleaning part as a video?
YouTuber of the YEAR!!!!
This is amazing series thanks it helped me a lot ...
I really enjoyed your series, thank you :) It was very fulfilling to see all the theory I've been learning in my Masters in such an easily understandable and interesting approach. New subscriber!
Thanks, this series was really useful to see what goes into a good project from beginning to end! I loved the honesty and openness (including how you showed the debugging process and where you copied code from online whenever you got stuck on something)
Dude, this whole series is awesome. Thank you thank you thank you.
Great and informative series! Keep it up
Great Series Ken! Very informative and easy to comprehend from a novices perspective. One question I do have and forgive me if I am not understanding this project correctly but how do we use this tool practically? We are able to scrap the listings from glass door and ultimately make a model to estimate an avg salary for a job but when it is all finished is this a tool where we can plug in a job title and a set of skills or something and it returns an average estimated salary for said job (for maybe salary negotiations of a current position etc.)? Sorry if this went over my head when going over the project!

Keep up the good work and I will continue to follow along!
Sean
Thank you so much Sir for this series. I hope to watch like this in future.
Thnx a lot man, this was fantastic!! Looking forward for your next projects. I would suggest: 'Sentiment Analyses' thnx again for your hard work
I really enjoyed watching your videos. To be honest i worked with the same Glassdoor dataset you used, but now i'm planning on doing the same steps with another dataset.
Wonderful Series Ken, just watched it. I Learned a lot throughout the videos, thank you.
Looking forward to the next series.
Give this man a biscuit. You have helped me obtain direction on how I should go about my projects. I will be referring to this series often. Again, you're a star.
damn man!! your honesty for this data science topic made me subscribe your channel and your content as well.  I'm also doing some online data science courses.  Love from India.
Thank you so much for this series!! As a freshman getting my bachelors in data science, this series helped me out a lot in terms of what to do when creating a project and how to overcome obstacles. Currently, we are just learning how to code and haven‚Äôt gone through the whole process as you showed us in this amazing series. So, I wanted to ask you if there‚Äôs anything you suggest for me to do this summer to learn more skills and gain more experience in the data science field ?
Thanks for creating this series. Watched and liked all 7 parts back to back.  Very informational and useful.  Looking forward to learn more from you.
thanks so much for these indepth walkthroughs.
Really a super awesome series ken. It helped a lot to every DS enthusiasts .
loved this series Ken!
keep doing great work man
Hi Everyone! Thank you for watching this series. It has gotten far better feedback than I could have imagined and I am grateful for everyone who has watched it. Again, I hope that it was helpful to you! Let me know below if you would like to see more videos like this, and what if anything you would change about this series. Thanks!
I thought that this would be the last video of this series,  but I decided to do a BONUS one coming out Friday! That one will be on writing a solid readme for your projects that will appeal to employers!
Question: If I were to add user input to predict the salary, they would have to input all these data? 
'avg_salary','Rating','Size','Type of ownership','Industry','Sector','Revenue','num_comp','hourly','employer_provided', 'job_state','same_state','age','python_yn','spark','aws','excel','job_simp','seniority','desc_len'
this section was harder across before sections, I hope make more video to model productionize.
Thank you very much!!! Very good video series! Deploy video is great and very useful!
Thank you for the amazing series ,God bless you
Thank you for the amazing series. Was really helpful
really liked your work, we need more people like you. keep it up man!!
issue: 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
what's the alternative command for touch in windows?
update: I did 'echo .>' command
this is not resolving altough i install git bash but cant figure it out
I didnt understand the part where we are making a request. For example if I am an end user, all I will be interested in is the salary for my position. So how would I be able to request that?
31:30: "Oh my goodness! It worked!" - The Golden Zenith of all Data Scientists! lol <3
The model was trained on around 178 features so how one should manually enter the data while accessing this project?
everybody kept telling me that Gunicorn do not work on windows but I made it work with some adjustments, great video though!
Hi Ken. Thanks a lot for this series. 
In this video I followed through till the request was made. After that I am constantly getting 
" x = request_json['input']
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable " error in flask and the output doesn't show. I have been trying to fix it since yesterday to no avail.
Great series Ken! Looking foward for the next one!
I want to ask one question so this part of series where I get struck because I don't understand it so is it okay that I like follow step by step this video do that ...I mean I still did a project but literally must have copied this thing so I am not sure what's your point view on this?ü•∫üòÖ
Heyy can you make a particular video on to choose which model should be used and like what are the most used model in general so in ML we learn that with great importance üíØ
Ps: I am taking too long to complete this series ü•¥
Again, nice job. It was really helpful. Now I understand how a model code should look like and I also learned some tricks.

There is only one thing I think could have been better. Sometimes I couldn't understand what you were doing nor why. It felt like I was just watching you code.
I understand it is hard to explain everything while you are debugging or improving the model, but you could have added some explanations while editing.

Anyway, this doesn't take the value of the video. 

Many thanks!!
This is some good stuff Ken. I really like this series.

I am not able to run the touch command in anaconda prompt probably cuz I work with windows 
issue: 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
what's the alternative command for touch in windows?
update: I did 'echo .>' command
Congratulations Ken for this amazing videos series ! My huge Thank you for passing all the content in details and providing insights along a project. I'm a big fan of you and you help me out a lot during my journey in the Data Science field!
ken can you share some details regarding the project based on nlp and cv. man you videos are the best
The content is super cool, just like its author, Ken! :)
This video is a bit hard for me to follow, so I tried some alternative and found someone else already mentioned in the comment, that is to use `Streamlit`, I personally find it easier to use to build the model into a web app compared to flask.
Hey, ken 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file'  how to solve this error? please help!
I am currently working on a data science project and was thinking of wrapping it up in a simple Django site. (more work than Flask but I think worth the effort) Do you usually make APIs out of projects? Does it sometimes come full circle as a full web app? I'm trying to stand out as an applicant.
Ken I'm not able to get the model as its showing : Buffer type mismatch 

File "sklearn\tree_tree.pyx", line 601, in sklearn.tree._tree.Tree.cinit
ValueError: Buffer dtype mismatch, expected 'SIZE_t' but got 'long long'

could you please help?
Hi Ken,

Could you please make a video on  Covid-19 prediction to attract recruiters post covid 19.

Thanks in advance :)
Nice work, you should do it more often, very practical and informative
Hi Ken. This has been a really helpful series for me!  
But, how did the command "touch" work for you? as it appears that it does not function in the Windows OS  and is definitely not working for me.
Hey Ken great videos!! I am a relative newbie and up until know I have been following along smoothly with no errors however with the step of running the "wsgi.py" file and running then curl X etc in the command line....I am getting the same error you were however the your fix did not work for me (@21:54 time stamp) and I made sure to copy the code you had to the letter.
Following Error:


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>
<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>


Any ideas??
Sean
Great tutorials! Have you considered trying streamlit for publishing the ‚Äûapp‚Äú?
Ken, I can't over emphasize the importance of this video series to me. Practical, insightful and indepth.Using real life practical examples. keep up the good work.. much thanks
Hey Ken.... I'm building a ML model in google colab can I make rest API using google colab
Please don‚Äôt stop making data science videos, Ken. Incredible stuff. More sports analysis/models potentially?
Great content ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
Hey Ken, great video as always! I was wondering whether next you could create a step by step introductory guide to GitHub and how to properly use it to store our projects after creating them on jupyter notebooks!
Looking forward to your reply!
Very excited that we get another video! You're a saint, Ken!
‚ÄãSir, can you do a project on healthcare/Medical or 1 video in which we follow your guidelines to do a project on it.
Really enjoyed this series. As someone learning the field I loved the practicality of it!

A video on the best resources for learning the right models to use in which scenarios would be great too!
Ohh, it mean we have to learn flask also..  to become a data scientist?
Awesome video dude.....coool.....
Earlier than I expected. Awesome! Already told my friend about your vids
Hi Everyone - Thanks for watching! I have gotten awesome feedback thus far on this series. Again, my focus here is to show that data science is an iterative process. You will constantly find bugs, errors, and make mistakes. You will also have to work through them and seek to understand them. I would love to hear about some of the problems errors or bugs you faced that you ended up figuring out in the comments section!
Done Part 5 üëçüèº Going to Part 6 üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇ
I've been slowly following along using data I was able to build a scraper for in my local real estate market. I think I have understood the process of everything to this point, but now that we are getting into making sense of the data, this is where I need to spend time learning what a lot of this means. I just got to the cross_val_score and I can't make heads or tails of what I'm looking at after reading a few brief reference sheets and articles.
Once again, great stuff. Quick question though (newbie here)... how come you didn't scale X_train and X_test prior to fitting your models? Or a more general question would be "Do you typically scale your X_train and X_test prior to fitting the data to your models?" I am primarily referring to non-tree models, like linear regression and lasso in this case. Thanks!
Thanks, this was a great series. One question I have is when you do the get_dummies, you are left with hundreds of columns, but when you productionize your model later on, would someone have to sit and fill hundreds of cells as data-in of your model? sorry if I am missing something obvious I am new to data science
Very awesome playlist! Ken you‚Äôre giving people such a valuable resource. I took an intro data science class at Stanford and they literally teach everything you just went through but in 10 weeks! From data scraping to initial visualization and even model selection. We used Google Colab to code in and imo Colab works very well and is integrated with Google Drive so file sharing is easier for newcomers. I‚Äôm pointing anybody that wants to learn data science straight to you from now on!
4:05-Lasso Regression
4:40-Random Forest Classifier
4:50-Tune Models GridSearchCV
Hi Ken! Aren't we supposed to call the fit method on the Lasso model object that was instantiated ?
great work! very informative video, thank you!
Hi Ken, I am late to the party in both this video and data science in general, but I'm hoping to teach myself enough to make a career pivot into data science (I'd be happy to take a job as a data analyst at this point). From the perspective of someone that has done two or three "data analysis" projects on Kaggle (that were really just really sloppy jobs at cleaning and EDA) being able to go on the journey from start to finish with someone that is an actual professional leaves me more appreciative than I can possible articulate. Thanks for the videos
Wouldn't it be more robust if you scaled the data before making a model??
There are a lot of columns that have different ranges of values so wouldn't scaling be better before the ML part!
Great video;
Has anyone reproduced the results? I did it but I am getting some different results. Anyone up for discussion?
Amazing series, even now in 2022, as a new person in the area of data science this has been really helpful because I was really struggling with how to begin a data science project. Thank you for the content.  BTW, I don't know if you are aware of this now on 2022, but you can use #%% on a spyder script to execute portions of code like if it was a Jupyter notebook with shift + enter, I think is a little more efficient than highlight the code and do F5. Just in case you are not aware of this, although I think it all comes down to personal preference. 

Sorry if my grammar is weird, I'm not an English native lol.
Amazing video KenüòÜ It helped me started in Data Sience
Why did he / you ignore r studio column in df_model ?
Hi Ken,

Great videos as always. I followed this one until 12:07. I am seeing 1.000 for R-squared and 0 for all P-values. Back in part 2, when doing the scraper I had to cut the numbers down to 250 because the process kept disconnecting. During data cleaning that number was cut down to 38. Although the numbers were vastly different compared to yours, I was able to work with it because it still produced all of the insightful analysis. Now I'm unsure if I should continue because both R-squared and P-values look weird
Hi Ken, i love the way you are making the videos for the entire DS process. I would like to add a point for this video where I suggest if you have spent the feature selection process Or criterias to add more values to model and this video. Just my 2 cents for the video. It's good work done. Keep going. All the best
Jesus
Hi Ken ! i'm facing issue while importing  'import statsmodels.api as sm' , i have installed statsmodels already ,  the error is : 'ImportError: cannot import name 'datetools'.' please help
Whoa!!
You can just do:    max(error)  to get the max value in error list
For finding the best value for alpha, instead of making a data frame,
We can also do,

alpha[np.argmax(error)]

np.argmax(error) returns the index of the error and we can use it to get the alpha value.

Hope this helps.
Thanks for putting this all together. More explanations on the algorithms and metrics would have been even more helpful.
What is the reason you are picking the alpha with max(error) should we not be minimizing this?
This is a great overview of the modeling part of a data science project. It has inspired me a lot, thank you so much for this kind of content, Ken
This is an amazing series üíØ
hey ken , wonderful video i was wondering where did u get the eda_data.csv file because in the past video we didnt save any csv file???
One of the best series I've ever seen on youtube related to data science. Thank you so much for this amazing effort. Very inspiring and motivating. Highly appreciated, bro.
@Ken Jee We can't use Ridge regression in these kind of data because of sparse nature of dataset. Right?
Hello Ken, I have a question probably is a stupid one but I need an answer. How and in which step we got eda_data.csv file. I watched the videos but maybe I missed it. Thank you so much for your help.
good vid , im not sure but you insert alpa = .13 when in the lasso regression , not sure if its an mistake.
Hey Ken, newbie here but loving the series and would love to see more. Wondering what 'level' of data science this is. Is this quite similar to what a data scientist would actually be doing in a work environment?
i'm getting a straight horizontal line when i plot Lasso regression. any idea why that's happening?
for my case, the MAE  was 
Linear Regression MAE : 5.6690763194922056e-15
Random forest MAE: 0.015459375000001213

is it correct?
I did this on my own data and the r-squared is 0.15 and average of the mean absolute error is -592780108. Anyone got super off results like this?
Bro can u make more series like this? This inspires a lot
I‚Äôm working with a dataset containing around 100,000 rows and my grid search has been running for around 3 hours now (using the same parameters as you). Is this normal? Could Jupyter notebooks potentially be the problem?
Hi Ken, thank you for the fantastic video! I am having an issue with my linear regression, I was getting an error that my X_sm was an object so i converted it to a float, but my R-squared value is 1.0 which just doesn't seem to be correct. Any ideas? Thanks again!
Hey Ken!! Fantastic series.When you instantiated GridSearchCV as gs..and passed rf,parameters and scoring in it..it also requires verbose parameter..mine is not executing without verbose..(ps: am using jupyter notebook)
Really appreciate your work, Ken
#This Lasso instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator. how to fix this error can't find anything in StackOverflow!
Hey Ken how would I use a combination of 2 models?
Hi Ken, at 12:00, when checking the multiple linear regression summary, for variables that has either very small coef (slope is close to zero) or p values smaller than 0.05 (statistically not significant), can we `safely` remove them from the regression model?
Another question is that, in my data, the multiple linear regression performs fairly well with the training data (use cross validation) but really bad on test data, is that caused by over-fitting? 
For Lasso and Random Forest, it's fine
Hi Ken, thank you for the tutorial, I have followed along from the beginning until here, I must admit that the most fun and useful part is to watching you got stuck by something and went through debugging. 

I have a question for dealing with missing data, in this example you consider "-1" for most categorical variables as a "new" category (by using dummies that's what it is in my understanding),  wouldn't it better to replace them with other forms or try to predict them using available values? It'd be great if you can share some insights on that. Thanks so much, please keep it up.
Another super helpful video. Thanks Ken!

Do you mind sharing a link to your Kaggle profile? I'd love to explore some more of your work.
Quick question: Would feature normalization and normalization of skewed data improve the results in this example or is it unnecessary? Any quick comment would help thanks.
At 11:58 when you wrote this code
X_sm = X = sm.add_constant(X)
model = sm.OLS(y,X_sm)
model.fit().summary()

After Writing this code i am getting this error
ValueError: Pandas data cast to numpy dtype of object. Check input data with np.asarray(data).

I have searched on StackOverflow , applied different solutions but none of them worked
If you also get an error message  (ValueError: DataFrame constructor not properly called!) when making the function to get the best alpha for the Lasso model :
err = list(zip(alpha,error))
instead of
err = tuple(zip(alpha,error))
Good Luck !
Hi Ken Jee, I have a question. So i m following your series (which is just so helpfull), and i tried to make some kind of a different approach without getting too far. I m making the same project, but instead of predicting the salary, i m predicting the "skills" required . Its about values from 0 to 3 : no degree/years of experience : 0, Bachelor : 1, Master : 2 and PhD : 3. Everything seem to work well until now. I made the linear regression model using sklearn and the result of the cross validation is extremely high beside the result i should have ([0:3]). So i tried to fluctuate the CV parameter, but it didn't change much. Do you have an idea of what could be wrong ? Thank you so much for your work !
Hi Ken. I have a request from you. Increase size of codes script for who watching you on mobile please. I know you sometimes zooming but thats not efficent.
Great series sir..! But I just wanted to ask what is the difference between using stats model & LinrearRegression() as I was usually using LinrearRegression() to train model so not getting the difference
This really is great stuff Ken!  Out of curiosity,  Why don't you have a patreon page or something?  You content is so valuable to aspiring data scientists, I'm sure people would want to support you.
I was also wondering, for the regression, since you use dummies, shouldn't you throw the base level of the categorical variables to solve any multicollinearity issues?
Hi Ken, very informative series. I would love other series like this dealing with other data science techniques such as deep learning, reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques.
Thanks for shared your knowledge. 
One question. in before video "part 4" the file "eda_data.csv" did no exist. in this video you work with that file, where does it come from?. Thanks.
You make it look easy.. I am a beginner.
Your explanation is so Clear and easy to understand i learned so much from you ken
Great video Ken! 
One question: in the train test, it is common in the industry to train at .8 and test at .2? or does it depend on a factor that I don't know about, a brief answer will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
Hey Ken I have a question, so I‚Äôve been following your project step-by-step to see if I can do it myself and follow along. Thanks for that, it‚Äôs great. Anyways, I can‚Äôt help but keep doubting myself and thinking I‚Äôm not good enough, like when I get I stick I see what you would do or go to stack and see some answer I could‚Äôve never thought of then I wonder how I‚Äôm ever going to make it in this field and be successful and then I get demotivated and stop studying, do you have any tips? Maybe something you went through that‚Äôs similar? Thank you.
I think one of the most important lessons of the video is: documentation is your best friend! Don't fear it, befriend it. Great video as always, Ken!
Really love your approach man.
So amazing to begin watching you before you began these series and then having this amazing 5 part lesson. There is no better teaching than practice, and you really just show practice. Excellent!
1st viewer i was waiting for it
Hey Everyone! I realized that there was so much information here, that an EDA could have made for a project itself. Please let me know in the comments section if you would be interested in a video where I go through the exact job related findings from the data in this phase!
This is a simple and extensive mode of EDA, really inspiring, am adopting best practices
thanks sir , you are the best
why do some use lambda in apply function vs what you did with the title_simplifier
so informative, I learned a lot
you have to also separate segment of the job description into company description and job description  it is great video love from india
As for somebody who's going to enter the data science field soon these are great tutorials. Thank you!

Hey ken, you converted min and max salary from hourly to annually by multiplying each value by 2. am cant figure out that makes it annual. please help. around https://youtu.be/QWgg4w1SpJ8?t=1003
Amazing
I loved this work, it helps to imagine and predict the daily problems of a data scientist may face and solve. Thank you highly, appreciate your work!
From where can I get the codes....which u have used in the tutorial
I am learning a lot from this series; real world project based learning. This is what an inexperienced person looks for. I want to see similar projects from you in the future. Also like your unedited videos showing us how you resolve coding errors. Thank you for your time and effort.
you can save a lot of time if you use control+arrow instead of just arrows, allows you to jump to the end/begining of the word
Got lost in between the video, I would definitely finish this playlist then start a relatively common project.
Hi Ken! thank you for the insightful content! I haven‚Äôt scrolled through all your videos but I was particularly interested about how to deal with not normal distributed data. You talked about normalisation and I heard that we could instead use other statistical methods to work with skewed data. Did you do that already on another video? And what do you think about Pandas Profiling? Thx again Ken!
a job simp ? eh
Way to go! This was what I was looking for - the actual number jiggling...
Thank you Ken! I liked that you did not edit "stuck" part ... Gives some motivation to a beginner like me. üòÖ
Hey Ken Jee, thanks so much for your videos, I have a confusion which I can't find a valid solution else where. It is regarding outliers.  In real data, outliers can exist in more than half of the features and make analysis challenging. 

Should I remove all outliers? When is the best time (or stage) to remove them?  During data cleaning or after building the very first model for inference?

Thanks!
Very informative playlist ken ....
Can I add till this part as my intern data analyst portfolio along with some modifications
can anyone help me please suppose i want to plot in "which state we have max salary"  how can we do so ?
I have a coding test for a job interview tomorrow where I have to do data cleaning and EDA in python. Your two videos have been very helpful! Thanks Ken
can You provide Us the code that you use in the end ? that gives image representation of all the words??
Amazing job ken thanks for sharing. Beatiful serie keep it up! Will you make any other serie like that??
Should I use Excel for the Pivot Table or Python ?
this video explains how part but it did not 
talk about what and why
Great Series.
In case you are confused with multiplying the hourly rate by 2, here what it happens under the hood: 2000 = 8hrs/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks.  The year has 52 weeks but 2 of those weeks are assigned to holidays and vacation time.
you are the best brother <3
hey Ken, I am doing my version of this project in R,
I have a question, when I find that Age is not normally distributed and that most of the data set are not old companies
what should I do then regarding analyzing the age? can I still depend on Age and see how Salary changes as a company gets older ?
or this means that there is under representation of the old companies in the data set and I can't draw any conclusions from the Age variable w.r.t the no. of job postings and Salary?
Have you ever did EDA on your own linkdin profile ...I came across this in Linkdin feed where they do eda and make dashboard on your own linkdin  data
This is very intresting because I have been doing EDA for Internship so this helps me a lot and can't wait for next type of project series üíØ
while scraping the glassdoor website it is redirecting to an Indian website is there any way I can stop it.

can anyone just guide me on how can I rectify it it will be really grateful

I stopped manually but the scrapping results are not convincing, like sometimes I am able to scrap the salary properly sometimes not.
Is there any reason you didn‚Äôt Start out with Pandas Profiling just to take a quick scan of the data?
The best thing about this video was watching Ken getting stuck, trying hard to figure out how to resolve the errors and googling the seaborn code. Just made me feel that it is totally okay to not know everything. Thank you Ken :)
thanks for sharing the whole process, including all 'surprises' along the way with error and google searches. Most people this that only geniuses can make it. This helps to "humanize" the data science process haha
Ken, I understand the value of understanding the data you are working with, but could you explicitly tell us what are the outputs you expect from an EDA and how it impacts the outcome of the model and of the project in general?
hey every1 if yall faced an issue with the nltk downloading (namely wordcloud error)  if u dont have the package use this

import nltk

nltk.download()
Hey Ken, I really appreciate this series but I worry about the dependant variable being the 'Glassdoor Estimate' It seems overly possible that any trends that you find in this EDA are properties of the Glassdoor Salary Estimate algo. Anyhow, this is great as a proof of concept. I would love for you to make a 'Data Science from Scratch 2.0' where you tackle a problem in the sports domain, where you are an expert and there is a wealth of real-world data to choose from!
hey ken  , while i am performing my wordcloud code part , i am getting this error "The _imagingft C module is not installed" , what should i do?
for doing this part "#Remove new lines from company text" , run this code 
df['company_txt'] = df.company_txt.apply(lambda x: x.replace('\n', '').replace('\r', ''))
Can u please explain how hourly was annual done? like why we multiplied by 2????????
Greate series!
Complete data noob here. My work uses Excel for data analysis and reporting, etc. Sounds like switching to Python (I'm a CS student so I love it) and Jupyter could be a good move. Is there a lot that can be done with these methods that Excel can't? Assuming the data is already cleaned and ready to analyze
U r the best...simply awesome videos
Aren't you data snooping the test set by doing a train-test split after EDA? Also, great series. Very helpful.
It is very difficult to see your codes, as the screen is so small. please make sure the codes are visible to us.
When do we remove the NaN or null values and outliers in the dataset?
This was such a fascinating video to watch. I think this is my favorite in the series so far and one that i'll be definitely coming back to and making some detailed notes on. Thanks for sharing the wealth of your knowledge :)
What are some benefits to using spyder as opposed to jupyter notebook for your other steps?  or is this just preference?  GREAT videos man, really enjoy all your content.

we cannot figure out the problem even if it is in front of us
I'm using python version 3.8.2 and even after installing wordcloud using pip3, anaconda wouldn't recognise it in the environment. From what I've learnt online after researching I found wordcloud isn't supported for python version 3.7 and above.  What should I do?
Hi Ken, thanks for this awesome series. I'm literally stuck at the end of this tutorial, it looks like stopwords variable isn't really pointing at the Corpusreader object in nltk. I'm getting the error code TypeError: 'WordListCorpusReader' object is not iterable. Any tips?
Hi Ken, just an idea to better extract seniority information, if we could take how many years experience required from the job description, that would be a good indicator. For now a lot of jobs `seniority` is `na`. Just my 2 cents opinion.

Also, do you still accept resume revision request? I've watched your serious of videos on resume and modified mine accordingly, it'd be great if you can take a quick look at it and provide any feedback, thank you so much!
Hi, Ken, what's the practical way to prevent multicollinearity. hv we done anything to prevent it in this project? Because I didn't see  any prevention after you creating the corr heatmap. :)
RuntimeWarning: Glyph 13 missing from current font.  Hey Ken getting this error 33:10 help please!
Hey, ken hourly wage to annual what actually it's 17:00 trying to calculate can you please explain?
This playlist is very good.

Best way to learn
Hey Ken,
I am just a beginner and I wasn't able to understand why should the variables follow a normal distribution in order to apply regression?
Loving the content so far, thanks!
Hi Ken, at 58:46, the error is caused by using `avg_salary` to pivot table against `avg_salary`, it can be solved by replacing the code:
for i in df_pivots.columns: 

with

for i in df_pivots.columns[:-1]:
hi sir,
In mu juypter notebooke value_count is not showing signature as value_count() when i press tab button
Hi Ken , Can you just explain that part 13:12  of converting hourly wage to annual. Btw  awesome content !!
hey this content is very useful and interesting , thank you so much. waiting for more such videos... :)
Thank you so much for this video, your channel has by far the most helpful content on data science on YouTube and its not even close. Keep up the great work!
wow, as a newbie, watching you do some cool stuff is so interesting :D. Especially the last part with that WorldCloud. I think it's an amazing package
Hey, for those who get stuck with multiple off 'Location' (i got multiple 'Location being like "los angeles" for Ken Jee).
It's not an optimal code but it does the job :
#Making every names a state abreviation
def state_simplifier(state):
    if  'utah' in state.lower():
        return 'UT'
    elif 'new jersey' in state.lower():
        return 'NJ'
    elif 'greenwood village' in state.lower():
        return 'CO'
    elif 'united state' in state.lower():
        return 'US'
    else :
        return state
df['job_state'] = df.job_state.apply(state_simplifier)
And to get rid of all the space after that i simply used a lambda -> replace : 
#getting rid of the spaces
df['job_state'] = df.job_state.apply(lambda x: x.replace(' ',''))
Hope it can help someone ! Have fun codding !
people, when to pass axis parameter, in DataFrame.apply() function ?
Ken doesnt put it in a few functions and it works, but at 13:45, the program hits an error!?
Thanks A Lot Ken For Your Data Science Project From Scratch Playlist Series. 
Ken Can You Recommend Some Youtube Tutorials OR Blog post where i can learn About All Machine Learning Algorithms. The maths behind them and also to implement them using scikit-learn.
And i am interested in starting freelancing in Data Science/ML.  Can you give some tips on how to start freelancing on upwork/fiverr about Data Science/ML
Thanks In Advance !
Should we have the Knowledge of Natural Language Processing to follow this project??
Hi Ken! am a beginner. I just want to know if this case study can be added in my resume after learning it thoroughly. ???
Thanks for this series, I have always felt intimated by the whole process of data analysis and model building, this series gave me plenty of confidence to step up my efforts in the field and focus more on projects as well. Thanks!

Also what is the font that you're using in Jupyter Lab?
Man, as a newbie I can't thank you enough for this playlist. Helped me wrap loose concepts altogether.
great content Ken... more like a therpy for data science learners, loved the way you exlained while working through
How‚Äôs EDA done for image based problems ?
Great stuff Ken!!! Even though I'm an R guy i still find these types of videos very valuable. It's great to see the actual thought process and methodology. Reminds me of gameplay videos lol
Hello Ken, Is there any that we can connect through WhatsApp? I want to grab more knowledge/ techniques from you because YOU ARE THE BEST. 
Please consider my request and I wont bug you with too many questions in case if we connect.
I basically followed and tried every step while watching the video. It is very practical and useful to learn during job preparation !! One little thing is could you please zoom in the page a bit more next time , especially edited in the dark IDE, so that it is easier to watch and practice the code together. :)
Sorry is this is a dumb question but what are we exactly looking for when we look for trends? Are there some common things that you look for as a data scientist or do you just really need to understand your data well and be creative to find some interesting things in your data? Any resources you suggest for how to go about doing EDA as a beginner?
Hey Ken It's very interesting as  I am beginner it makes me more curious to learn new concepts and I am following all your playlist
I'm watching all the series in a night, perfect for the beginners!! Greetings from Barcelona
in my case for Python 3.8.2 in Windows 10:
*Anaconda prompt in Administrator mode, run this code:
conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud #solved


Or

Download package:
* wordcloud‚Äë1.6.0‚Äëcp38‚Äëcp38‚Äëwin_amd64.whl
 from
* https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wordcloud 
in Windows cmd  move to folder download and run this script: 
* pip install .\wordcloud-1.6.0-cp38-cp3 #solved
Hi Ken! Your video really inspires me a lot! Keep up the good work and hope I will be as good as you one day! :)))
Hi Ken, a small tip for 35:30, instead of rotating axis labels I usually flip coordinates. It makes all the labels visible and the reader does not have to turn his/her neck to read the label. Great work by the way, really loving the content so far!
What's pre requisite to do a exploratory data analysis? 
Python pandas
May be statistics and?
In my case , i change three line of code in glassdoor_scraper.py:
job_buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("jl") #the loop interupter in 12 iterarions.
for
job_buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("jobContainer") #solved
and data_Cleaning.py 
df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1]) #undifined position 
for
df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[0]) #solved
and 
df_out = df.drop(['Job Title'], axis = 1) #in windows, excel the firts column no is 'Unname'
for 
df_out = df.drop([], axis = 0)  #Solved
Good job !!
Great video Ken! This is exactly the motivation I needed to continue my data Science journey. The lockdown has been a morale killer  but your video definitely motivated me to keep learning. 
Thank you!
Hi Ken, Thank you so much for the series and everything you have done so far in this chanel. In case of the series "Data Science Project from Scratch", this is something I was looking for. Practical knowladge, without cutting, with using Google if it's necessary. Definitely, you helped me a lot to sort my knowledge and add some interesting tips. Keep a finger crossed for development of your chanel and if I can say something negative, then... I would rather to have a possibility to give you more thumbs up :D
I loved the compelling data storytelling during your exploratory data analysis phase. I can't wait for part five. Thank you for your effort and value. More grace Sir
Please make a video on complete roadmap to become a data scientist
I think you may benefit from chopping these into 20-30 min sections. I think that's more digestible for the average viewer and you get more bang for your buck as far as time invested vs content goes. Anyways, enjoying the content as always.
Ken Jee upload the video" Like video comment on video, then watch :D
i'm from Tunisia in North africa and i'm very interested to learn data sience for  sport . can you please send me the  books that you used to learn betting and sport anaytics !
this is my email : Salemwisal@gmail.com
thank you!
awesome content!! I don't have time to watch all of it right now, but I definitely will. I am in a data science course right now and the book we use is literally called "Data Science from Scratch"! :)
Part 4 on exploratory data analysis is coming out this Friday! If you haven't seen part 1&2 they are neatly packaged in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t. Would love any feedback on this video and series in the comments section below!
thank you so much MR KEN üòç
‚ù§
This guy is making journey of struggle fun which is hardest thing to do
guys, my spyder python 3.9 cannot detect any file. it does not detect any file(on the right upper side in this videos) which it should according to this video. help.
can we use anaconda python (jupyter notebook) for this process also?
This is great stuff! I really like how you use the apply method for pretty much everything... makes me wonder why I (and others) bother to memorize a bunch of pd methods, when all you really need is to knowing how to correctly apply the "apply method".
why vdo quality is poor i am unable to see the words, is this only at my side?
thanks for this informative videos
For searching for R in the Job Description, I believe you can search for " R " (with spaces), correct?
lambda x: 1 if ' R ' in x else 0

That would prevent every "r" in a word from the column and count.
Thanks Ken .  it's helpful lost in my daily work.
Really loved the process, Ken you are a painkiller!
Thanks for what you have done so far, it really helped.
11:00-Important
33:00-
Excellent video as always Ken ! Just a small query - when you simply removed the 'per hour' from the salary text, wouldn't it have been worthwhile to multiply the min and max salary by the avg. number of working hours in a year, because the other salaries are also given annually, presumably? (since the timeframe of all salaries need to be equal)
This have been an amazing tutorial about "exactly what i was looking for", thank so much, for showing all this process!
Thank you for this great video. Learned some good stuff. I perticularly learned git in the last and this video.
This is gold, thank you! Ciao from Italy
Nice processüëç
Ken Jee this is Great Stuff
instead of dropping an "Unnamed: 0" column, we can pass the "index_col = 0" argument in the first place when we define the df variable as our dataFrame variable.

maybe looks like this
df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv', index_col=0)

the documentation says "index_col=False can be used to force pandas to not use the first column as the index,"

correct me if i'm wrong. 

hey by the way, what a nice playlist, i enjoyed it. thanks ken, big thumbs up
Somebody might have commented already, but in more recent data pulls some salaries are more precise thus they don't have a range so edited the lambda for max salary checking len(x.split('-') first to avoid out of range errors
Hi, I am entering into the Data Science world and I have an easy question:

 I am using Sublime Text and not Spider. When I plot my dataframe there (df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv'; print(df)) I do not get a terminal where I can explore the whole data (like Ken does). Instead what I get is the df cut off. I can explore it by using some commands like ".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc..." and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that.

Does anyone know what could I do to display the whole dataframe outside Sublime Text to explore it? 

Ty very much!
This is outstanding content. Watching this series before I have started on a project will save me so much time.
Amazing set of videos! Thanks for all these hard work! As data scientist yourself I believe you don't need the income from these videos but just love sharing knowledge, greatly appreciated üëç
very helpful!Thank u for making this vedio.
Hi Ken, I first want to say following these vids has been amazing so far.

Quick Question, sometimes I get the following error: 
StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document

I think It may have something to do with my internet connection, because it happens randomly during the scraping process.

I guess the question is does the file have to feature 1000 entries? I think working with a smaller data pool might prevent the random error. Will something like 500 or even 250 work?
I am absolutely LOVING this series! I've been studying for a while and always wondered how an actual data scientist would use all these tools on an actual project. Great work Ken! Just found your channel today and I have a feeling I'll go through your videos really fast
I really shouldn‚Äôt have laughed at 30:16 when Ken‚Äôs like ‚Äúyea sorry about the sirens. You know, tough times out there‚Äù. But it‚Äôs nice comical relief when you‚Äôre slogging through code like that. Ken you do a GREAT job at explaining the process end to end! I love this mini-series.
If you could increase the font size of your codes.
That would be very great!!
Thank you!
What IDE is he using?
Thank you Ken for this Amazing content!
Very helpful, thanks
Hi Ken jee...  How are you ?..can u please tell me .. in this playlist from where to where a data analyst part(i want to learn to fit in data analyst position )... Thanks for your efforts...
Hi in python code :df["Age"]= df.Founded.apply( lambda x: x if x<1 else 2020 - x ) , -1 will still present in new column Age?
I luv u Ken u teach me so much
yeap !! i was stuck on parsing!! you made it soo clear! THANK YOU KENN
Warning Read This Message Carefully
Maybe you are good in data scinece field maybe you are a good teacher but when you teach us we can not see properly your coding so you should zoom your content and one of your friend which channel name code basics who is greate video creator and he is your friend so he can help you to making good video editing like he is do.
love you brother ‚ù§
Thanks for the video Ken. I have a question on saving the datafile after the cleaning process.  Though not applicable in this video--when I clean up dates and some string fields--saving as .csv loses all those changes. Then the beginning of my EDA is doing that cleanup for the fields the csv does not save. Is this normal? Am I missing something? Appreciate the help. Be well.
lamba function is actually quite useful! damn.
Hey ! Can you tell how you scraped the csv file of glassdoor . It would help a lot. I'm complete new to it, so have no idea. Thanks !
This series is amazing! But in 33:55 it would be nice if you had also checked which jobs are asking for Masters degree, or asking for X years of experience
Thanks so much Ken. 
Learning a lot from your mini series. I do understand and appreciate the time and energy commitment and surely hope you shall continue the series.
You have ended the hate I have had for Lambda functions (just because I couldn't understand them) in the first 20 mins of the video. Thank you!
Thank you so much Ken, please keep it up.
That was very helpful, I got a small question when you clean the salary why not change the hourly to a year salary?
Hi ken, at 37:44 when you are trying to parse the job description, for that excel job, it seems you forgot to change the function that count the jobs, you took aws as it is.. üòÖ and finally thanks for this whole Data Science project series.
For the cleaning, can I use Excel as well and then save as .CSV and load back into the   code?
btw the output console at 29:00 shows that Los Angeles is counted as a state(but it's not)
Great video, thanks so much! I noticed that if you use '  r  ' (whitespace on each side of the r) you get some of the r results that otherwise would have been missed by only using 'r studio' and 'r-studio' in the lambda function
Hi Ken, i just started this series and i am at 23:44 as of the time writing this comment. i think you mixed the hourly and annual salary which can skew your data.

e.g. $28/hour = ~58K p.a. (40h/week, 52 weeks)

since you replaced $ and K you will use the 28 for your average calculation instead of the 58.

But since you marked them in the additional column im sure that you adress this issue in the video.
Found your chanel these days and cannot wait to code this project over christmas holidays and learn a lot along the way. This looks like a very quality series! Great content! I especially like that we see the whole iterative process of a project and the googling and looking things up and everything. Very nice :)
This is actually so good for me understand the concept while you are doing the project and also I think maybe cause of dark mode I am not able to see properly on my mobile I will try watching somewhere else but other than this series is worth it 
I hope you make a new series of project with another ideaüíØüòäüëè
üôèüèº
Great job again. As people already mentioned, uploading the video without editing enable us to understand the process and be more confident that "trial and error" is part of the process.

Also, you should add a highlight to that moment when you checked the company foundation date, this is a really important sanity check.

Obs. Apply seems amazing. I write a lot of bad code to do the cleaning, it is embarrassing haha
Man, this series you made is the most important video in my learning by far. Thanks to you I realize I'm already can start building projects and work more on my portfolio. I was always thinking I'm not ready enough but with your series, I realize that I know what to do. I can't say how much your series had helped me. Thank you!
thanks ken, really appreciate the effort in these vids

says index out of range although i splitted on comma so if any1 faces the same issue i would recommend doing what i did 
replace 
df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1])
with
df['job_state']= df.apply(lambda x: x['Location'][-2:], axis=1)
we took -2 as all the states are 2 characters at the end
within the dataset there are some observations preappended with 'salary:' so int() is throwing an error at this point of getting the min & max salaries. to get that out of the way.i did this: minus_hr = minus_hr.apply(lambda x: x.split(':')[1] if 'salary' in x.lower() else x)
Wow, I love these series! Very helpful and inspiring
This guy is amazing!
Hi Ken!
Great video and value, I learned alot. I have one question:
Why did you make a separate column for "Employer provided salary"? It makes sense to me to simply remove it from text and treat it as regular salary. What is your opinion on this?
i like the series but zoom in required for videos
This is just amazing Ken ! now I know that's the kind of job I wanna do for a living :) thank you so much for sharing !
Lmao! U have good quality. Freshers like us should follow ur style.üòú
Hey Ken,  

Not sure what you're reasoning or purpose of creating your Youtube videos are, but you've been an inspiration towards me, and if you get down or whatever, just know that you've helped me alot.
what a clear explanation man, hats off..:)
i'm already equipped with basic python knowledge,  how do i begin Data Science
Hi Ken, I am not able perform below code in python 3 - giving me error
df['min_salary'] = min_hr.apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[0]))
When I am using [1] then it's giving me max value but not min with [0]
Thanks for all the effort you put in Ken. It takes a lot of effort and time in making these videos which will help you and as well as the community.

I had enormous interest towards sports and I do want to contribute to the field .However I came across your videos and i really like the way those videos were organised.Keep your good work mate
Excellent. this is very helpful.
In 37:40 ish , you copied the code from above and edit for the excel function, but u forgot to edit the value count which is still 'aws' count so you said 'surprisingly data are the same.' :D . Needless to say , your whole video is Great. :D
Hi Ken. Really it was a great video on the data cleaning process. as a data science beginner i was really finding the data cleaning part extremely irritating when it tried it on some of the beginner projects that you have recommended. but after watching this video it would certainly help me a lot to practice more on data cleaning process.
Thank you for this amazing content! At 37:50, you looked at the value counts for aws not Excel. Line 58 says 'df.aws.value_counts()' when it should say 'df.excel.value_counts()'
i can't understand how you removed glassdoor est. with just split('(')[0]). I'm confused. please explain bro.
I love your commitment towards teaching 
replying and liking each and every comment is not so easy 
but that's what making you special 
keep growing and keep sharing knowledge 
I hope one day you will reach your expectations 
thank you alooootttt
Hello Ken, I was able to scrape 1000 jobs from glassdoor but I noticed all the salary estimates are the same (58-90k). Please what could be wrong?
First went through a couple of minutes of the video where you discussed what had to be done and started solving it by my own. Once I was done, came back here to check out how you'd solved. This was immensely helpful as my code was not as efficient, and learnt better approaches to the same problem! Thanks Ken!
values_count you used for excel is 'aws' copy and paste/editing error (37:40) I think you meant to say df.excel.values_count( ). Otherwise lambda made simple here. Please could  you do videos on lambda? Otherwise great video as always. so much to pick up Thank you!
impressive work so much to learn thanks for doing this Ken keep up the hard work!
Hi Ken... This is really very informative, for me as a newbie in DS. Glad to see that as comfortable as you are using the lambda instead of RegEx with this one to clean up data, yet had to google how to drop a column. :)  I thought that was very cool that you didn't edit it out and makes me feel better. Very encouraging... keep up! Thanks a lot for sharing.
Been following this channel since I got let go after COVID 19 budget cuts, but figured I'd try to turn something bad into a good opportunity and use this time to learn data science, but this series is awesome coz it really ties in all the theoretical pieces from the coursework together. thank you! Around 26:15, Ken u said we didn't specify a series and we have to let the dataframe know we're doing this on rows....- I don't get this, what does axis = 1 do??
These videos are incredibly helpful man. Thanks a ton from an inspiring data scientist!!!!!!!
Hi Ken, I've been following your work quite some time now. The way you keep your online presence is inspirational. I would love it if you have more step-by-step project videos on Youtube. There are so many areas in which I don't even know if analytics are applied. Sport analytics is interesting for me for example. Also, projects with more practical implications like the regular churn model or HR analytics would add value to your channel, too. I would enjoy watching them on my end at least.
Just a piece of suggestion on selecting keywords from job description, use "for loop" will make it better organized and easier to add new keywords, and the new added columns will always have the same suffix "_yn", to avoid unnecessary inconsistencies.

skills = ['python','sql','excel','aws','spark','nlp','rstudio']
for skill in skills:
    df[skill + '_yn'] = df['Job Description'].apply(lambda x: 1 if skill in x.lower() else 0)
Thank you for the work Ken, the idea of showing everything step by step is very helpful for beginners. It's boring indeed but no one can get stuff done without the boring phase. I really like the IDE you are using here, with a variable window on the top right, very easy to click on and check out each new variable created, is this Spyder? I am using Pycharm and Jupyter notebook, and didn't find similar features from them, do you know if there is a way in Jupyter notebook to show table contents in a separate window? right now I just use "df.head()" to check, thank you so much.
Thank you. the tutorials are very crisp and interesting. Favorite series for sure.
Excelent video!!
hey ken! i hope you are fine. stay home, stay safe. i would like to give suggestions to
make videos on
1)-data visualiztion
2)- real time projects of data science 
3)- contest going on kaggle and teach how to solve them.
4)- just do not stop making these wonderful videos on data science, it is very helpful for newbie in data science. 

All the best!!
I also love the background music. Can you tell me where can I find it?
Thank you for your playlist! It's really helpful
Yeah, this series is super useful for beginners like me. Thanks for making this.
I really like this series and I really learned a lot. I am also reaching out to you for a project Idea, I am a data engineer. Please help me
A good series explaining the data science process which a lot of videos and articles ignore. This video in particular would be the time to mention using existing and/or creating a codebook for the dataset.
Fist of all, thank you for your time making this series. 
It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a  project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture.

I'm having a hard time...  
I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/...
Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions


What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?

Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready?
Or what am i supposed to do?
Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...

I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

Thank so much you and keep the good work!
Thank you so much Ken. It is very helpful.
If anyone getting error at 21:55 when Ken tries to convert it into int.
I tried this method and it worked for me:
df['min salary'] = pd.to_numeric(df['min salary'], errors='coerce')
df['max salary'] = pd.to_numeric(df['max salary'], errors='coerce')
df['min salary'] = df['min salary'].fillna(0).astype('int64')
df['max salary'] = df['max salary'].fillna(0).astype('int64')
After This Data Type Will be Changed From Object to int64.
You can also check  Data Types of every single Column in your DataSet using
df.info()
Or
df.dtypes
In Jupyter NoteBook
Very good tutorial. I love the way you explain things. It's easy to understand! ^_^
If we follow all these videos step-by-step, could this count as a project to put on a resume or LinkedIn?
appreciated for your  excellent and exceptional work! As a suggestion the videos are a bit long it would be much better if you split them into like scraping data, data cleaning, etc. Hard to see some of the codes on big screen maybe consider using Jupyter Notebook or changing the font or background colour Thank you for your all hard work!
Great series. I'm trying it out after looking at your video. I feel that the per hour salary is just for an hour. While you have replaced the per hour with a blank. Aren't we gonna convert the per hour to the actual salary. By googling I found out that a data scientist in the US works almost 60 hours. Shouldn't we multiply this with the per hour salary and then with 52?
Is it possible to see the data frame as you are in the top right corner (similar to how it's presented in R) in PyCharm or is this view specific to your IDE?
This series is exactly what I wanted and I highly recommend to anyone who is entering in Data Science.
Hi Ken, what is your opinion of writing Unit test to make sure your data cleaning is done correctly? It is hard to find a mistake when you have thousands of rows. But you can find mistakes better if you data set is small and controlled.
I used to Hate Lambda function , but really I got  good understanding from this Video ,
Thank you so Much
Was nice to see near the end of the video that even you too had to look something up! Further backed up your video saying that no real data scientist memorizes everything. We appreciate you for all that your doing!
Hi Ken! I am an italian master's degree student in computer science, and this kind of videos are pure gold! I have a question: since I'm currently attending classes, are there ways to work on projects of this type, let's say "freelance"?
I would like to start making a bit of money but without affecting the lessons, thanks!
Hi Ken. When you did the search for excel, you forgot to change df.aws to df.excel which is why you got the exact same count.
I tried using lambda functions the way u are using to mark as 1 if data have 'developer' But i am getting error.
TypeError: argument of type 'float' is not iterable
a['developer']=a['MainBranch'].apply(lambda x : 1 if 'developer' in x else 0)
Main branch contains statements something like below
Ex : I am a developer by profession , I am student, I am working as a hobby.


Please let me know what mistake I am doing.
Hi Ken. Thank you so much for this series. This series is such a huge boost for people like me who are trying to learn data science on their own. I have a question regarding the data cleaning. In the video, you manually scrolled through the data to find odd values such as 'per hour', 'employer provided salary' etc. in the Salary Estimate column. But how would you find that kind of value when the data frame has hundreds of thousands or millions of rows? Is there any function or way to find those odd data without manually scrolling or searching?
Excellent work, Ken. Your 'soup to nuts' approach is extremely helpful to those like me who are brand new to data science. On top of everything, I like how you show us your use of Git and GitHub as well as all of the lambda functions. Keep it up!
I still don't have enough experience in using python but am amazed in all the "magic' that it can do! Great job, Ken! You're amazing! :)
In my case , i change three line of code in glassdoor_scraper.py:
job_buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("jl") #the loop interupter in 12 iterarions.

Incredible video series. Thanks a lot for this info, no one did videos projects like this. I will follow closely each one and please make more series like this. Thanks and  already subscribed to the channel!!
Thanks a lot for your well-detailed videos! Massive help.
Hey ken the reason why excel has the same count as aws is because after you did the lamda for excel you didn‚Äôt replace aws to excel to count
Great work man! Thanks a lot
Hey Ken,
Is it just me that I'm unable to see the salary component on the left-aligned job summary columns. I'm able to see only 1. Company Name, 2. Job Title, 3. Location. Is the Salary estimate not visible on the updated Glassdoor page?
I got '-1' as salary estimate for all jobs.¬†And this is the same URL from Omer Sakariya's code.
URL = https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Job/san-francisco-data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,13_IC1147401_KO14,28.htm?locKeyword=San%20Francisco,%20CA&seniorityType=all&applicationType=0&locT=C&remoteWorkType=0&fromAge=-1&minRating=0.0&minSalary=0&cityId=-1&employerSizes=0&industryId=-1&companyId=-1&sc.keyword=data+scientist&includeNoSalaryJobs=true&jobType=all&radius=100&locId=1147401&sgocId=-1&countryRedirect=true¬†

From the "Part 2" tutorial, the salary estimate was available in the short summarized segment of the Glassdoor pages.
Now the 'Salary' is visible at the different experience levels (Trainee/ Junior/ Senior roles) which becomes tedious to extract and clean.
Awesome video. Is this project resume worthy?
Great examples! I really like the content you are providing üëåüèª but I‚Äôm wondering, how much of the statistics you learned while studying are you applying on a regular basis?
these have been enormously helpful. i've been watching a lot of videos not necessarily acting just yet. btw when the weather gets warmer are you going to be wearing tank tops in your vids?
Data cleaning process is a very important step and can be very tough at times depending on how messy our dataset is. Thanks for the detailed video Ken!
Things every Data science beginner needed.
Thanks Man. Keep it up :)
Hello Ken üëã I am interested in making a project with a deep learning algorithm. Could you suggest me a good deep learning algorithm to work on. Thanks.
Edit: the project will be for my CV
I really like that you don't edit things out. I think the process is much more informational than just the result. This is a good mini-series man, keep it up!
Loving this series, definitely going to take notes on these videos , so I have steps and a nice framework to follow when I put together my own data science project. Currently trying to build out my portfolio in order to get a job, I have been doing some follow-along tutorials to familiarize myself with some technologies I would like to learn : python (pandas,scikit-learn, tensor flow) , pyspark, and then Airflow. Eventually I would like to create an end-to-end project using a combination of these technologies. Keep the videos coming man! Thanks!
Alternate title: "Part 3 (Lots of lambda functions)" haha! Great video Ken, really enjoyed the on-the-spot feature engineering
I'm a DS Major and this is very helpful. I can see your channel blowing up when all the software engineers are switching over to DS! lol
Part 4 on exploratory data analysis is coming out this Friday! If you haven't seen part 1&2 they are neatly packaged in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t. Would love any feedback on this video and series in the comments section below!
A wonderful way to present this sometimes confusing topic. Thank you!
Hello sir ,
 you have created a very interesting video that I have never seen before . And it also help me to grow my own channel # DecodeTheCode thank you so much sir

Hello sir, I have a question,
If we give a list of locations so it will change location by itself after completing scraping of jobs in one location? 
I am waiting for your response.
Thank you sir for making such a good videos for us.. these are very helpful.
8:53 you can select the first word of the with a double click and then go to the end of the code and then Shift +  click on the last code you want to select. And there you go. I find this easier.
I'm stucked in the finding the x part. The structure of glassdoor changed so I updated the class but I still get 'x out failed'
your position in front of a computer is wrong, care for your health, and thanks for tuts
Hi Ken I am not able to see screen clearly now it's bluring
In order to copy many lines of code, 
you can highlight the first couple words in the code, then scroll to the end of the code you want to copy.
Then hold shift button and click with the mouse the end of the code.
Should the aspiring data scientists be aware of Web Scapping? Should we learn about selenium and beautiful soup? Or is this the work of a data engineer?

What seems to be happening (based on the message and looking at the screen as it attempts to scrape) is that the code is either not properly able to exit from the 'Sign Up' pop-up or maybe it's not able to click on a posting. 

I've been scratching my head at this for a while now and I'm really stuck. I'm using your code now directly from your GitHub. Anything you recommend trying? I love this series and am finding it very helpful but would love to follow along.
Can you please maje another same Blog on web scraping
Thanks you Sensei Ken jee
Little complicated but worth watching because I learned a few new things. I couldn't make it run though so moving to the next video and will use your data file. I will come back to this video in the future after I learn some Selenium. Thank you for this unedited video!
Hello Ken Jee, 
i was trying this code, but in my case the below line is returning a empty list. 
job_buttons = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("jl")
@Ken this content is gold and qualitative in terms of pushing individual horizons to do trial and error and build stuff~

Anybody who was able to solve the issue of scraping the job_buttons off the current Glass door website please lend your help, the website has changed and it no longer accepts 'jl' as the class name for those elements thanks. :)
Hi Ken,
I followed your scrapping process. After following the process you did to get rid of sign up prompt and when I run the scrapping, it gives me the following error


"x out failed
Scraping terminated before reaching target number of jobs. Needed 5, got 0."
I really enjoy this natural approach, picking up real examples without preparation, it feels more genuine, great video, thanks

Awesome series! Can you do another series like this- maybe with a more complicated project?
i dislike the programming practices but i love to see people getting passionate about their trade, so for that, i respect ken jee. video's pretty old, i hope u got better with  some of the stuff u do with python, github, etc. lol but that's ok, nbd, i suppose, but it obviously wouldn't hurt and i imagine it's pretty common among people who use programming but are not programmers..  sorry just commenting out-loud.
for 18:27 which got succeeded in scrapping, mine is getting terminated? what can be the solution?
Hi Ken, what the steps for creating a web scraping file
I have tried this too many times but the only result I got is "Scraping terminated before reaching a target number of jobs".Please if someone can help how to fix it.

Great video Ken! Thank you so much for sharing.
I feel so satisfied seeing you copy the codes. I thought only freshers does that
In my case it was not so easy like copy-paste, I found a scrapper from 3 years ago üòÖü§≠ i'll should do by myseld, and i think write a blog of something, ü§î
Since im in Europe scrapping for me is not working as i think the allow cookies part is stopping it from scrapping, any suggestions on how to bypass that?
Hi Ken, how did you achieve 12:46 by doing the 11:25 part? Did you create a new file?
Is it just me or glassdoor has made its html scrape-proof? I tried reproducing the code but I couldn't comprehend how I could access the elements with company name, salary est., location, etc. The elements are just divs with job ids in class name and no extra attributes to access them. Anyone have a workaround, please help? If possible, can anyone share the link with the dataset you scraped because I really want to follow along with the tutorial. Thanks in advance
Hey, do we need to install anaconda or is just spyder okay?
Can someone please help understand the below error I am getting,
" Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".selected"} "
Ken, I envy your ability to build something of value so quickly. ü§ñ
Hello, I am trying to use the code to extract information from glassdoor but code is no more working may be due to changes in glassdoor . can you suggest
As much as I admire this series, blindly making a tutorial where your copy and pasting code as part of a tutorial -- which is aimed at beginner's is not the best way to teach, as more often than not, they won't understand what's going on, selenium is easy enough to read the docs for, this could of been achieved by showing your process how you would do this on your own.
Hi Ken

After making suggested changes in Glassdoor_scrapper code when I try to import as module in new window but It shows following error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'glassdoor_scrapper'". Please help me to address it.
Hello Ken Jee, thanks a lot for the playing. It is awesome for newbies like me!

I am trying to follow along with the video, but I get the following error: "<input>:1: DeprecationWarning: find_element_by_* commands are deprecated. Please use find_element() instead"

I am trying to replace all "find_element_by_xpath" with find_element(by=XPATH, value = xpath) but I cannot figure out how to make it work!

I LIKE YOUR TEACHING WAY BHAI!!
How to copy multipage code:    ( BTW yours videos are awesome .. like real crispy and to the point ) 
1. Mouse click on the starting position say .. def 
2. scroll down ( No mouse selection .. just scroll ) the position to the point  and the click while you hold the shift button.. 

* Please ignore if someone already suggested the same..
Would be good ot mention that some websites (like glassdoor) are updated all the time and that this script won't work after a while
Hello Ken 
I am running into this error.... please assist

Can someone help me with installing the chrome driver?
Could someone help me with this issue?
Scraping terminated before reaching target number of jobs. Needed 15, got 0.
Thank you so much for this series! I am planning on transitioning to data science and I'm new to its programming aspects. How did you know what to do at 15:29? I figured that was HTML code. Do I need to learn HTML to be able to spot and fix those errors? Thanks again Ken!

Hello, I am on Mac using Python 7.22, since this video was made, I am sure there are some changes to the code. I am getting 'str' object has no attribute 'click' as an error on most of the lines ending in .click(). Does anyone have a solution for this? I am fairly new to this and really want to get through the project but have been stuck here for days.
Thank you for this inside look.

Hi Ken. Great video. Following along, but it seems Glassdoor changed their class names especially infoEntity from the parser. Any suggestions on how to workaround this?
whenever i launched selenium it says that it cant locate  element method css selector selector selected
i spent  two days preparing and learing this project and i am stuck at 17:00. i am getting this error Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".selected"} 
if someone has got the solution, let me know. I already searched a lot on internet but didn"t find solution. i replaced the glassdoor website with indeed.com too but the same error on  indeed. Also i changed the sleep time from 1 up to 500 but still no luck.

Thank you for this great video!!! I am trying to scrap data more than 30 rows, it failed when it scraped into page 2. The error shows ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable
  (Session info: chrome=90.0.4430.212) Does it means this code did not write the case when scrapping more than one page.
Hi, when I try to run the scraper  I just get stuck on chrome opening with the message "Chrome is being controlled by automated test software". I don't know what could be causing this.
i got this error while running: OSError: [WinError 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application
EDIT: I solved this problem by adding anaconda3 to path variables, but now I can't click the Close button. I tried many ways to do this but since 3 hours I still CAN'T Do this... I surrender.
Hey ken!

The fact that you make this video with no cuts, showing us the whole process, trial and error and everything, makes this so unbelievably valuable. There's thousands of data science videos and how tos online, but I've never seen someone who lets me look right over their shoulder during the process. Kudos.
How did I not know of this before! Brilliant work man. Thank you so much for doing this!

Hello Ken, Thanks for uploading this helpful series. It is really helping me understand the basics very well! :) 



I had a question about data collection. Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure. How to mitigate this problem?
This is huge; exactly what I was hoping to find because I couldn't visualize what a data science project really even means, where to start, etc - I'm learning on my own. I greatly appreciate the unedited process for tweaking the scraper. That stuff could be passed off as a bullet point "collect data", but we all know that even folks that do this daily spend some time going through what you went though in this video. 

If anyone else is working on a raspberry pi or Linux system, and has issues with selenium.. let me know. I went down a rabbit hole figuring out how to set it up.
Unfortunately this code is broken now. I think Glassdoor has made some changes. For example, class "jl" is now "react-job-listing". I've made a little progress in making some changes.
Is this script still working for you? I grabbed the code from your repo. I keep getting a NoSuchElementException "Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".selected"}"
Hey Ken, really good content, thank you so much. There's nothing like these series, looking forward to more of these type of series.
Tried almost everything but getting this error:  Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".selected"}.
ugh. im not sure what im doing wrong. I keep getting¬†
selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":".selected"}.¬†
Does anyone have any idea how to fix?
At 11:25, How did you go from a fully coded screen to just 5 lines of code when the driver path and other things were typed in? After you said, "Let's run this", I have no idea what you did to remove all that code, and just wind up with only 5 lines of code.
you can select all the code all at once by holding down 'command/shift'. Just keep holding down command/shift, and the previous code will not deselect.
Loved the video!!!!
please can someone help me 
i can't install glassdoor package 
i'm using pip3 and i have python3 install but when i run the pip3 install glassdoor command on my command prompt  i get a verry long error message
which at the end says invalid syntax
How can I install glassdoor scraper?
Hello Ken, Thank you for this tutorial.. 
Need a help..
"alt=close" not working.. cant find close button in the Inspect as well.. please help as to what key to fetch in.. Much Thanks:)
To copy a full code cell you click in the code cell and use CTRL +  A which would highlight everything the CTRL + C to copy everything. Great vid!
yeah there's a better and easy way to copy the entire script 
first, off you highlight the entire script by clicking at the beginning of the first line of the script and then scroll down to the end (make sure you don't click anywhere else) now hold the shift key and click at the end of the last line of code (while still holding the shift key)it will then highlight the entire script and now u can press ctrl+c to copy it.
this is greater stuff that I have come across I'm new to data science and I spend over a month on youtube trying to get me started with the journey but didn't really find a step by step tutorial as simple and straight forward for a beginner like this channel right here.
thanks, bro  its really so helpful 

please can you make a video on git bash and how to connect it to GitHub?
the process stops at: "Progress: 0/15". No error message whatsoever. :/ Anybody has an idea why?
Hi Ken, I am trying to use your scraper, but it is not scraping, it just shows "x out worked Progress: 0/15" and that is it. Do I have to download something else? Im a beginner!
i got that error 
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException, ElementClickInterceptedException
Ken, i'm going through this entire project with you:) As selenium goes through the glass door website i get the error after a few cases saying ElementNotInteractableException ... i have added this error to the webscraper.py and like the other errors added pass but the error is reoccurring....can i get some advice?
I was facing an issue while scrapping.

Search as per keywords was not happening.

To tackle that I had to add the following code just below the "#clicking to the X." try block.

Code :- 
        try:
            driver.find_element_by_id('HeroSearchButton').click()
        except NoSuchElementException:
            pass

##I'm just clicking on search before scrapping.
## Make sure it executes only once
Thanks for the content @Ken
When scraping the 600th job there is no progress in scraping anymore and when I look into chrome I see a reload button and when I click it by myself then a "StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document" Error is thrown. But before clicking myself at the reload button, there is no error thrown nor progress anymore. Does anybody knows a solution to that problem?
Having issues  with the chrome driver
Thank you for an informative tutorial. I am having the following error while running the code: OSError: [WinError 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application
To copy the selenium scraper in one go just go to the first line of the code block and click so that your cursor is flashing, then scroll down to the bottom, once you get there, hold shift and click again and that will highlight everything between the two points where you click with your cursor

Huge time saver :)

I am not getting salaries in my data frame(It's coming -1 as default)
I did some digging, but I am not getting it.
Please help!!!!!
** ERROR (HELP)
When changing the Grey small salary to grey salary still no results.
Went in and inspected the element it is written as (CSS-1uyte96 CSS-hca4ks e1wijj24) which should be grey salary

If anyone has any insight on this and could help I would greatly appreciate it!
I'm getting some random css number as the span class name (css-1uyte9r css-hca4ks e1wijj242) of the salary estimate. When I'm entering that name in the scraper code, its returning -1. Any idea how to overcome this?
Amazing job Ken. I will definitely give you credits for my first project.
hey, ken wonderful video , i faced an error while copying the data soo many a times i used to get this output  (x out failed) in the middle of the extraction, and then suddenly it just paused at 622 /1000 like didnt pause but its just stuck there idk what to do @ken

My scrapper gets stuck when getting the data...Any suggestions to resolve??
All the indian guys trying this project , use the data directly present in the github repo , dont run scrapper coz indian version of glassdoor is a bit differnt imo.
Hi Ken, amazing content, never come across such a thorough video (especially data scrapping part). Big fan of playingnumbers.com too. Can you make a video of the same type for a data visualization project maybe using tableau.
cant import glassdoor_scraper as gs. anyone knows why?
Hello I wanted to ask that I want data related to job profile- Data Scientist and Job location as Bangalore. When I searched in glassdoor.com the salary for the jobs posted in bangalore is not specified so any help here would be appreciated.
Thanks Ken!! you are the best. I manage to get my hands dirty. but I am curious about starting up my own scraping using another problem. can I still make use of the same function?
Great approach for working on a good project. Thanks for sharing. I'll get my hands on it when I master my basics
Hi Ken ...Project from scratch series really helps me to understand how does data scientists works on real world project in their companies...Thank you so much for your efforts...very appreciating ... looking for more such kind of projects from you.
@12:56 how do you run the browser ?

am getting this: WebDriverException: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH. Please see https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home
I do not know why all salary estimate values are repeated,  I followed your video and fix it the same as you then I copy the source code but the salary estimate keeps repeated ,do you have any solution ? Thanks a lot for these videos, they are really helpful.
Awesome concept for a series!
Great Video!!
This is helpful and enlightening. In my certificate program we‚Äôve been using different tools and add ons to do all this. THIS is much more work but a worthwhile endeavor. It will take some time to get up to speed with github and my coding environment. I was doing coding in a different arena 5 years ago. I hope it informs my ds coding environment
**An easy way to select text** @8:52
1. click where the text starts (just place the cursor and click without holding)

Ken I'm curious as to why you prefer spyder over jupyter? Just your preferred editor?
This is a game changing playlist. By far one of the most valuable lessons to date. Thank you!
Ken the just scrape the code that scrapes the website so obv bruh
use css selectors to get html and use scrapy to scrape.
Hey Ken! Loved the video as always. 
I'm still in college and I am aspiring to be a data scientist later on. I just had a question that considering my current academic condition (year 2) is it all good if I use the code of other users (giving them proper credit of course) for my projects which I intend to present for securing an internship later on?

As always, truly appreciate your videos. Keep up the good work of helping us!
Thanks alot
Do you have another way of determining the IDE you want to use outside of it being your preference?
He ken ! great series 
When i run the program the data starts fetching but after a few records one more pop up appears and the entire process stops! 
What should i do?
Thank you so much for the video! I followed along. Unfortunately I got the result for Salary all the same values. I am from the USA. I checked Inspect section, made sure that it's still "gray salary". Any ideas how I can fix it?
hi thank you and keep doing this amazing job and i have question i was doing the same like you but i have problem is spider give this message module not found error can you help me thank yoou

Great video Ken!!
*Solution to the error messages*
I made these two changes to the scraper file and now it runs all OK.

1. JOB button:
Replaced job_button.click() with 
driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", job_button)


2. NEXT button:
Replaced  driver.find_element_by_xpath('.//li[@class="next"]//a').click() with
next_button=driver.find_element_by_xpath('.//li[@class="next"]//a');
driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", next_button)
When I also put the Job title keyword as "Data Scientist", and run the program, the glassdoor Job search bar only shows first 5 character as "datas". Can't seem to understand why this is happening? I have also tried with the other keywords like Analyst -  even here it  just shows first 5 character as Analy. Can you help why this is happening?
selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable: element has zero size  (Session info: chrome=83.0.4103.116)


I am getting this error every time I run this model.
Thank you for making these excellent series, very well structured!
Thank you so much for this series, it's really helpful for beginners like me. I have a question though, I followed almost exactly how you revised the codes, the only difference is probably that I am using data from both Canada and USA, and the "salary estimate" column shows all identical values (e.g. CA$89K-CA$100K (Glassdoor Est.)) but all the other columns (e.g. rating, company name) are just fine. This is so confusing to me since the codes formats for reading "estimate salary" and "rating" are the same. Any insights you can share why this occurs? Thank you so much.
Thank you Ken for such a wonderful tutorial, it was easy to follow and simple for a beginner to keep up with. I have been scraping Data Science jobs in Canada and they are less than 1000. My num_jobs variable is 1000. So, what is happening is when the scraper reached the last page on glassdoor it is going in a loop and collecting data from the same 5 jobs over and over, I guess it will do that till the length of jobs dictionary reached 1000. What can I do to make it stop once there are no new jobs?
Thanks for the great video! Just out of curiosity, is it illegal to scrape data online with selenium and BeautifulSoup for a project?
Ken, you are the G.O.A.T. 
I recently started to learn python and its application in data analysis, but I was struggling with getting the data in the first place.
This series is awesome! keep up your good work
Thank you veryy much for such an amazing project!! You have covered end to end of this project and it is very very helpful for beginners like me! Thank you so much üòä

****Solution to one of the problem that I ran to ****
Error :  ElementNotInteractableException: element not interactable: element has zero size (Session info: chrome=83.0.4103.97)

Cheers !!!
You can easily select and copy code on GitHub by clicking 'Raw' when you view the file, then press CTRL+A and CTRL+C to select and copy it before pressing CTRL+V to paste it into your editor.
Thanks a lot for this Ken, loving the raw approach!!
Also you could've just downloaded the Jupiter notebook as a .py file. 
Looking forward to this.
Cheers!
Ken Jee thank you for this video. I‚Äôm just. Beginner and while I‚Äôm trying to run the code I keep getting the following error even though selenium is already installed.

ModuleNotFoundError: no module named ‚Äòselenium‚Äô

I tried manually installing selenium by unpacking the taz file, still the error is there. What has gone wrong?
How do we know when to stop.the scraper
Do we actually need to know the purpose of each line  of copied Selenium code or we can just copy and paste it as it is ?
thank you Ken
HI Ken I am getting X out failed ,while scrapping

selenium module error on python3? please help
Hi Ken! I'm a little late here but I'm getting stuck trying to run the initial web scraper and getting the following error after printing 'Progress: 0/15'

ElementClickInterceptedException: Message: element click intercepted: Element <li class="jl react-job-listing gdGrid selected" data-id="3343053790" data-emp-id="1309610" data-is-organic-job="false" data-ad-order-id="919804" data-sgoc-id="1019" data-is-easy-apply="false" data-normalize-job-title="Data Scientist" data-job-loc="San Francisco, CA" data-job-loc-id="1147401" data-job-loc-type="C" data-njslv="false" style="">...</li> is not clickable at point (216, 292). Other element would receive the click: <div class="background-overlay" aria-label="Background Overlay"></div>
  (Session info: chrome=83.0.4103.61)

What seems to be happening (based on the message and looking at the screen as it attempts to scrape) is that the code is either not properly able to exit from the 'Sign Up' pop-up or maybe it's not able to click on a posting. 

I've been scratching my head at this for a while now and I'm really stuck. I'm using your code now directly from your GitHub. Anything you recommend trying? I love this series and am finding it very helpful but would love to follow along.
It could be better to just download the notebook and convert it to .py https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17077494/how-do-i-convert-a-ipython-notebook-into-a-python-file-via-commandline
Just cause you asked :  There is a suggestion - Why did you not select raw format and copy from there ?
Am new to the DS environment and the setting up of the repo and all had already overwhelm me.  And the nitty gritty details to amend the code.  Hope I am able to digest and pick up as I continue my upskilling
Hi Ken! What keyboard shortcut did you click to run the program at 20:29 where it showed the Chrome browser opening?

Can you suggest a solution please?
First of all, thank you for your great content. Beautifully explained. I came across an issue, when I run data_collection.py after progress 44/1000, it shows the following errors:
selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotInteractableException: Message: element not interactable: element has zero size
  (Session info: chrome=83.0.4103.61)
Can you please help. I tried slack but still stuck. 
Thank you again for your content. 
Really appreciated !!!
Thank you very much. The way you faced and solved the bugs is unique and inspirational. Some other videos out there are too well-prepared, which is easy to delude people into the perfectness of the code. Consequently, if the code somehow does not run, people don't know how to solve. Please keep this style.
I am not sure if this is legal cause the robots.txt file at LinkedIn disallows everything on jobs. Mostly every useful data to scrap is disallowed.
For other people - if you have the remote URL permission problem(?) with SSH (26:35), this website could help you. https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url
I got the same Salary Estimate values from start to end... I don't know why and it's really a pain in the ass
Thank you so much for posting! I am learning so much, especially what I don't know. and need to learn for my current data project. I'm changing my career to be a data scientist (well aiming for data analyst for now and I'll build up more skills to transfer to data science). It's quite exciting!
Hey Ken, really appreciate your effort.  
I am facing a problem though. Since, i am an Indian user, the website is being redirected to Indian version of the web page and Indian version lacks salary on top where company name, position and location is mentioned. 
What can i do to solve this? 

p.s: Also, while redirecting it gives an option to undo it, but as soon as undo it, the scrapping process gets terminated with an error KeyboardInterrupt.
I don't usually comment on youtube videos, but this series is simply amazing! It's often difficult to find content on data cleaning and model production, so this project series will benefit me a ton. Quick question- what is the best way to go about modifying the scraper so that it can scrape a much larger dataset (i.e. 5000 or 10000 data points)?
It seems my web scraper isn't scrolling down to access new postings.  It will successfully scrape the first handful (up to 15) and then spit out this error:
ElementNotInteractableException: element not interactable: element has zero size

The error appears to be coming from line 61:  job_button.click() 
Does anyone know how to deal with this?  I am new to web scraping.

Thanks!
You can copy the entire code from Jupiter Notebook by clicking, holding, and scrolling. :)
Hi Ken,
I started web scraping and made necessary changes to retrieve estimate_salary as Described in the video, but I failed. By the way, you have inspired a lot to me man, thank you so much. Keep posting great content, very excited for upcoming content.
I was using the jupyter notebook on Mozilla and I‚Äôm getting the driver error again and again. I tried to fix it but it shows unicodeescape error
The text small and hard to see.
Hi Ken, we're you able to scrape the 1000 jobs in one shot,  because I kept getting an error of 'element click intercepted' after the script went through a few job posts. And I googled the world and couldn't find what that error meant. Thanks for your videos they're great.
Try to use the "Raw" button if there's one on top of the editor within the page where you want to get the code from
hey man, i'm from Brasil, and i'm starting a project of soccer data analysis. Your videos are realy helping me out! Thank you!
Hi Everyone, can anyone please assist with this error:
StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document
  (Session info: chrome=81.0.4044.138)


I don't get this error unless I try to scrape a large number of jobs, which is weird.
I am an absolute beginner. All this years i realised i always learnt the theory first ,the details first but i wanted to try if i can look up into a project and build curiosity and then work on basics. This really helped. Thank you. Regards , mech. Engineer.
Hi Ken Jee, this is great tutorials! thank you so much !! that's what i'm looking for !!
he Ken Jee, thnx 4 the great tutorials! really loving them.. I'm trying to replicate what you did as a way of learning (i'm still in the learning phase of programming), however when i load the page, i get a ' cookie - consent' pop-up! As a result the scraping doesn't continue (however, when i manually press 'accept cookies' it does continue). Do you know a way i can hard code this in python so that when the page opens, it automatically excepts the cookies too?
Hi Ken, thanks for the series! I'm currently at @23.50. Around halfway through running the iterations I'm receiving an error saying the element is not clickable at point (219, 653). Other elements would receive the click: <div class="gdGrid noPad">. Do you know why?
yes I have downloaded chrome driver and saved in same folder. But chrome driver is 32bit and my laptop is 64 bit support. Please help as I'm beginner and I find really interesting your channel.

Hey Ken,  really good content as always, keep the projects coming! One question, I was trying to run the script and for some reason the Salary fields were all coming in as the same salary estimate (usually the first job that was copied). Any reason why you could see this being the case.
Hi kenn  I tried running the code in Google colab , and have even specified the path of chrome driver in environment variable ,found the following error: 


PS: I have downloaded the latest chrome driver wrt to the chrome update,and have specified the exact path .

Would you know a possible fix for this? Thanks always for your great content
Hey Ken, really good content, thank you so much. Just wanted to suggest a change, I guess the jobs.append code in the bottom part is supposed to be outside the if condition, by mistake you put it inside. :)
Hi Ken, good video as always.  I was working on this tutorial and the scrap file worked fine yesterday. I tried scrapping more data today however the "glassdoor_scraper.py" file started to return an error every time I run the "data_collection.py" file. Perhaps glassdoor made changes on their website. I tried cloning your project from Github and it gave the same error. Could you look into this?

Thanks Ken!
Hi! What text editor do you use for Git? Vim
Thanks!! Subscribed
followed this through and get an error - TypeError: get_jobs() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'path' and 'slp_time'. not clear i have these variables set properly. thanks.
Hi Ken,
I really like the Video and looking forward to this series. One question i want to ask you is that can i add this project to my resume.
Please reply back to my question.
You're a star. This is a great eye-opener.
Hey Ken,
The Data Science project series is amazing and much needed.
Quick question: Just like we used 'keyword' for searching with job title, what would be the change in code if location too needs a keyword search?
Awesome vid
Hello is very good your channel, is possible get some remote job of data science or data analisis
Can we use web scrapping tool like (parsehub) for data collection?
thank you for the video! one question though: say this came up during an interview and I was tasked with making a scraper. Would it be OK to say to use someone else's code and provide credit for it? look forward to seeing this entire series as I'm currently in my own project-building phase for my data scientist career transition.
This is my first comment on youtube since I am using computer/Internet and It's for you Ken. You have started such a great super awesome series ( Data Science Project from Scratch ) that most of youtubers have'nt and I love it. You are such a great man.  Your Videos are very informative. I believe this series will give your channel more and more subscribers.
Loving this series! Really enjoyed this "buying ingredients" process! :p
There's nothing quite like a video that shows the raw process and is practical! Thanks a ton Ken, looking forward to the rest of the series--especially the data cleaning!
I would think that a database containing the relevant data would exist and then we could see some SQL action
Hi, Ken! Is it possible to use ipad when doing data science? Thank you!
Hey Everyone - I hope you enjoyed the video! Stay tuned for Part 3: Data Cleaning that will be coming out on Wednesday 4/8. I am loving the questions and comments so far, so please keep them coming!
I loved the video.
Happy that I have found your announcement on reddit, looking forward for the next episode.
Amazing series, very well structured! Can't wait to see more!
Do you prefer to learn data science in R or python? Very informative video, can‚Äôt wait for part 3!
Great work flow example. Keep up the good work!
Great video, thanks again. I'm curious, you found pre-existing code and made edits to it as you went along. How often is this the case for you on the job or for any other data scientist? How prepared should one be to make their own data scraper? Is that something that we will bump into a lot in the future?
Dope screen
Finally  :D
I am happy to hold you guys accountable on your projects! Leave some of your ideas in the section below to make sure that you will do them. Also, make sure to subscribe and turn on notifications to be alerted when part 2 comes out on Monday!
thank you thank you thank you! a thousand times thank you!!!!!!
Hi , can you please let me know where can I get a live dataset for market mixing model project
https://codeverse001.blogspot.com/2023/08/data-science-in-sports-analytics.html
Hey, this is Amazing. Just wanted to know, I am an absolute beginner in Data science. So should I be doing this? Will I be able to understand data science after this or should I complete some prerequisites before starting this project?
Stumbled upon this video as I'm in in the middle of coop search term. Will it help in any way if I included whatever I did in this series in my resume ?
Thank you for the feedback Ken sir !!!
Awesome video but i have questions what are the key skills that an undergraduate student must have to secure or placed in data analytics and what about career improvement? Please sir answer the question i m lot of confused there.
From where we can collect data apart from Kaggle?
one of the things in the video is the background music. somehow that keeps us glued in the video and also you content is amazing sir. Thank you for this.
Thank you, even just this intro made me much more confident about my current university assignment.
What are the prerequisites(skills)for this projects? What should I learn before this project.
Thanks a lot for uploading detailed and crisp DS project. This is really helpful !!
Sir please help how we train model and do some prediction in data cleaning project.
hey ken , thank you so much for this appealing effort that you are doing
Oh my god this is exactly what i want thank you thank you thank you.God bless you and guide you to the right way
Would love a sports DS project from scratch
Very underrated channel! I believe i just found a diamond in a haystack!
RObust talking bro
Hey Ken ! Thank you for creating an amazing platform for us to not get overwhelmed with data science. This is my start of data science journey. I am so glad to be here. More power to you :)
should i know about machine learning to watch this playlist?
woo! Thanks!
I am starting a transition to data science from etl. Can you pls guide
Is there any job as sports data scientist? because i am a big football fan and also interested in data science
It's very good. How ever,  I try the code, it's not working.
It will be wonderful
Can anyone who attended product company interviews/ working as data scientist in product company guide me what topics are must for data scientist  interviews in a product company...
      Also am interested to know the importance of data structure& algos , probability statistics  in these interviews for experienced candidates..
Sir! please tell me of I am going in the right Direction. 
I had done Training in Machine learning and that training focused less on working with data and more on Algorithms.
I stopped learning ML and have heavily focused on working with Data and Understanding it. 
Now I am working on BI and planning to work on ML after it. 
Am i on the right track?
amazing stuff didnt even know i needed this
Hi Ken, Thanks for your video. I need to do a project and I don't know what topic to choose. Any ideas?. Thanks a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBeP0E0Tdw
please make a road map video
What is the minimum skill to get intothis project? Python, Numpy, pandas, matplotlib all done. Am i good to go to this? Or need more skill like ML?
You are phenomenal and so is this series! I am primarily a spatial and kinetic learner and for some reason, I'm insane with statistics and probability though I tend to forget the formal terminology and theories that I actually implement. I've been wanting to find a way to learn hands on then get the terminology later on, since I'm in school full time, working full time and beginning my first start up so this series is helpful and simply perfect for my schedule.
Hi! I am already following this series and this morning I was reading an article about a man who got an interview from the first data science job he applied for; he started his data science journey by following this series too! The article is by Mario Paul at Towards Data Science titled: "I Got An Interview From The Only Data Science Job I applied for." This is so awesome!
Okay so I been following your work for few months and I didn't came across this data science project from scratch series but anyway starting from today .
Ps: I came to know about this from @andrewmomoney channel video on data science bible for 66 daysüíØü§õüëç
That's great!! , I think mastering the skill of working on projects and uploading and using them in making a powerful personal portfolio is the keyword of being professional in the field and getting finding good job , so plz we need more of that staff
Great Playlist Ken, This is me Fahad from my other channel where I teach Data Science in Arabic, do  have a look at my channel there are some English videos, Thanks man, Keep up the good work
Awesome series. Thanks a lot!
Thanks so much Ken, it's very helpful to outline all the major parts of the project like you did.
Ken, first of all, thanks a lot for making the series. I wanted to ask your opinion of a fresher (me) doing a project on the credit risk analysis from kaggle. As tons of people have done a lot of work on this already, do you think its worth working on it ? do you think it could be interesting enough to be put on the resume?
Hi ken, I am struggling to find an affordable desktop computer or laptop ( No more than 400 USD ) that would help me open and use IDEs and other tools fast and comfortably, I would really appreciate it if you could give me your recommendations as my laptop is really slow. Thank you
My new favorite series on Youtube  :) Thank you Ken JEE
This is perfect. Please add more like this and explain why you are doing the steps. Most teach but dont explain the reasoning. A series on basic DS projects would be awesome.
thank you so much for making these videos! Very informative!
Hello sir thanks for this project. Can you please make a video on datascience project using image datasets
Thanks for the great content!
Love this series. This is exactly what I need help with right now. Thank you so much....You're rock Ken :)
Hey, I just started watching your videos. Great content ! Looking forward to follow this series.
FYI: You are awesome !
hello ken sir,
I am having a consulting firm in india for a costing and taxtion work... i have team for the same, I want to start now in new field of data science  as my firm is set and these is really good analytical field which i will like to work on.
I find your videos really interesting and showing the way ahead . I want to make you my mentor.
Thanks & Regards,
Deepali (India)
Hi Ken, 

If I follow along with the project but do it for different cities in India, do I have permission to put it on my github or does it class as plagiarism. If so, I won't be sharing it online. Of course, I will write about your work,link  and mention the original idea in the Readme. Is it intellectual property theft if done this way?
i just Beginner i need to understand how to know Business requirement  or how to understand this  Business ?
I want to start in kaggle projects ,please recommended for me some project i can solve ,thanks
Ken we would love to see more series like this . Totally loveddd it !  .
Hi Ken, I want to thank you for your content, I find it really helpful :), Also I had a few questions that I wanted to ask you! what would be a good place to shoot questions? Thanks!
I love you Ken. I have not paid attention to the series as it is focused on data science (I am a data engineer, just starting though) not when I saw the 5th video of the series then I read the description. There is so much to take away for this. Thanks
what to do when robots.txt show's disallow should you proceed? Cause if you show this to a hiring manager he might take it as a red flag for ethics.
Can't thank you enough
Hey Ken, thank you so much for this. I am currently trying to transition from consulting to data science, but have been really struggling to find ways to demonstrate my knowledge to potential employers. This really helped! Projects don't look like so daunting now!
Thanks for this wonderful project walk through.  You are my teacher now.
Cool man...
Thank you Keen for this series ! I"ll be thankful if I'll see more videos from you ! Good Job Man
Hey Ken, the quality of your videos are getting better and I am enjoying this series. thank you for this content!
Thank you for the Data Science project from scratch videos series.
Just getting into your work. Thank you so much learning more from you than I am in class
Thanks Jen i am national lawn tennis player and want to be a data scientist the moment I saw you writing tennis I hit the like button ,this is the perfect one for me to startup with
Please do something on soccer
Looking forward to part 2 :)
This is a great video! Thank you
nice. I am working on my first proper project & would like to see how pros go about it.
This is real helpful. Thanks for the video :). I¬¥m excited to see the more!.
discord? only respond with a date! hahaha
Finally !! Thank you Ken !
I'm so excited for this series!
Good work, keep rocking ü§úü§õ
i hope this will help me on my final project.
waiting for the next video
Keep it up, thanks for the great content!
Thanks man! Eagerly waiting to end the whole project with you. My first DS project *_*
Hi Ken, I'm glad I stumbled upon your channel. Looking forward to see more of your upcoming videos. Project videos are a great idea, keep it up!
Another great video. Showing us how to think and plan rather than just spitting out explicit answers. Excited for the future installments.
Thank you for this addition! I think I want to start with linear regression on premier league soccer and predicting final league standing from early-season information.
Men! I was waiting for this. Thank you very much!
Instagram Human mimic AI bot.
Using autoencoders to mimmic human behavior.
Thank you @ken This is not just yet another great video but a great tutorial for model builders to build responsible AI
We may really face some bad consequences due to the exhaustive use of data to manipulate humans. 

I will not completely blame the people who are using data in a bad way but it is also our responsibility to stay alert and make the right choice. 

The people who say that they are just doing their job must understand that they will also get into that loophole...
Ken, I really appreciated this video as you are sharing every side of data science which shows honesty and responsibility towards society. Thanks a lot...
Black box algorithms such as Neural networks?
For youtube algo
Very good content! I'm taking a Data Science bachelor in a University in Portugal. Do you think it has a bright future? We learn Python, R, SQL, AI, Statistics, Machine Learning techniques and in our Senior year we have to do an research project and develop a project for a companie. (You have the link here if you to check it out) https://www.iscte-iul.pt/course/291/bachelor-bsc-in-data-science 
Keep with the great work and I hope you do well with this channel, a lot of great content about DS here!
Good content. Can you do a video on ARIMA in Python and going through in details the ADF test, forecasting, train/test?
Hi Ken, Edoardo Brizi here. We've spoken on LinkedIn and as I told you I'm one of your newer subscribers.
I've been binge watching your videos since we've chatted and I wanted to give you props for the content you have on your channel. Very instructive and insightful!
Best,
E.B.
Great stuff! üëçüèª just started using Matplotlib today. Man that‚Äôs confusing üòÖ
Your content is so underrated.
Another great video Ken!!


Could you do a beginner project from start to finish video ? Maybe include a part two to it where you show how to display the data using Tableau ?


-Mario
Nice shirtüéâ
Glad I found your channel Ken! I feel extra-motivated. Thanks for all the tips!
I think it's important to emphasize the danger of trying to ultralearn anything.  If you let ambition get ahead of you then it can really come back and bite you.
This is a great guideline Ken! Thanks. From here I created my own meta-learning framework for my data science learning roadmap.
How to use data science to compile a search engine for just resolving error messages lol. Seriously, from TVs to routers to IDEs to vehicles, one glorious site for error messages/codes would be AMAZING.
Hi Ken,
Just curious about something, where do you learn best? At home most of the time, or would you go to a cafe/ library occasionally ? 

I personally need that change of environment sometimes so I head to a cafe sometimes, even though I'm saving for masters.
I just got the book last week and am reading it now.  I love it.  Thanks for the suggestion!
This is a great recommendation!
Thanks for the advice!
Please consider opening up a discord server to gather the community of learners ;D
just suscribed. thanks mate
Hi Ken, Thanks for short notes.
Leaning into the frustration and boredom  at times - working on that now
Man Hello from Thailand. This is what i looking for . Im from data sci learning path  from your vid . This is pure Motivation for beginner like me .thanks a lot.
She's hot and you know it.
Comment with yourself. Then I'll be illeterate until you quit.
Would continue?
If you're not serious on the girl just play something.
Thank you Ken... It's really helpful for maintaining descipline...
sir, could you please tell me about the background music being used .its so motivating and it gives me a pump for pushing myself forward.
Love your stuff man! Because of you and Daniel Bourke I landed my first Data Science job.  Also just bought the Ken's Nearest Neighbor shirt being a fellow Ken and all lol
I just subscribed and the number turned 93.000 üôåüèª Nice Job
Thanks for sharing! keep up the great work! :)
I've watched your videos a lot that i forgot to subscribe (btw i did it).It felt so badüòù
Hey Ken, Another great advice from you. I have been following your video for some time. They have been really helpful with my preparation.
I would like to make a road map of my data science journey.  How do I learn more about the field of data science and associated disciplines?
Content, monitor background, and polo are on point.
I could only manage step 4 and 5 so far..
Good stay that way...!
Do you think I can get a job in data analytics from commerce background without a traditional studying approach, i.e, a degree?
How good is the course on coursera, Data science by IBM
Hi Ken, what a fantastic channel and platform you have created!! 

I have been watching your videos for the last 2 hours now and you have given me so much insights in this small time! I am torn between diving into Data Science and focusing on the path as a Digital Analyst with no programming skills. Haven't found a video to that. Would you consider talking about that one day soon? (bell notification is on :-) )
I would love to contribute to your excellent work with using an affiliate link. Can you provide one for www.audible.de? 
Keep up the good work! All the best from Austria.
Hi Ken, I am starting my data science journey. My goal is to have a data science job in the next 8 months. I have created a study plan, I currently learning phyton, and next, I'll start working on a project. Your channel is so valuable and has a lot of good information. Thank you for making such insightful videos. Keep up the good work!
great video Ken, keep it up
There is so much content and so many books on Data Science. What to start with? Im literally a beginner
Your channel is gold brother keep it up!
you are a gem !
Hi Ken, I‚Äôd be interested in a live stream for career review & feedback. Thanks!
Hello Ken
I face problem after building a model that is I am struggling to enhance my accuracy. My data overfits and my accuracy keeps on stuck there and then and there's no one to guide me. What to do?
Thank you so much for making these very informational and insightful videos! I‚Äôm a rising college freshman, and I foresee myself watching all your videos as I begin self-learning data science this summer break!
I love your videos and the channel, but get very distracted by your eyes flickering when you read the script. I don't know if it's just me, I think it would be a better experience to just have a VoiceOver or something, or maybe putting the script in notes format in front of you, occasionally looking down is okay. Thanks, and keep up! :)
The teacher üå¨Ô∏è
i am watching your videos from past 1 hour and it has cleared a lot of  doubts of mine.....thank you
Scott young‚òØÔ∏è‚òØÔ∏è‚òØÔ∏è
The moment i learn about Data Science i knew i have found where to put my focus on but i still haven't been able to make a goal in that direction, any tips?
What keyboard is that?
Thank you for uploading videos and help us to develop new skills.
Going through the book which you mentioned in the video (ultralearning).
Will re-watch  the video once I complete the book.
Good stuff
i want to learn data science hoping for a career change.. i've started doing programming more with python since 2018 and also some machine learning stuff.. but im very easily distracted and therefore, unable to focus.. thanks for this video
yeah, do the live streams
The lighting for video is seriously under-rated.
Thank you for the inspiration! Also, can we see your biceps too :)
Hey... You are doing a great job..! I always enjoy your content and it is informative. 
I am a machine learning student i am practicing machine learning since 2 years now and  I am in my 3rd year of B.tech Degree but i do not have any internship.. Can you please help me out with this.?
how can you enjoy frustration? it's most horrible feeling when something doesn't work....
I get solutions for my every problem by your videos.Thank You very much Keep going sir.
Your videos really inspire me a lot <3
Very well-structured advice. Subscribed and looking forward to more videos
your videos are amazing
Thanks a ton for this video Ken! I recently dropped out of my physics PhD after going through some hard times financially and after falling in love with data science. Your videos are absolutely invaluable to me and I'm very appreciative of the work you put into them!
I don't feel so bad now spending half the time I devote each day to acquiring data analyst/science skills in learning math: linear algebra, statistics and probability, and calculus. A live stream video reviewing resumes or projects would be highly valuable.  Now back to practicing multiplying matrices I go!
I will do as you suggest and watch those videos before asking you :) if you downt have it already, maybe some playlist would be a good idea. ‚ÄúMy recommended order of watching‚Äù, ‚ÄúSee these before asking me questions‚Äù. I would at least like it. I plan on watching all of the videos, but with the corona situation, closed kindergartens and schools, I‚Äôm trying to learn statistical analysis while having 3 small kids home, so it may take some time. Anyway you have already given me the most clear information on what a data scientist actually do, and I only have a little more than a year left of my bachelor‚Äôs. So thank you üëçüèª
Awesome this is a very good concept to share  and you are right most people watching this  are self directed. Thanks for sharing .
@Ken Jee¬† hello ken, i am pursuing masters degree in data science and planned to graduate in August. I am now worried about job market due the present situation. How bad it would be impacted in terms of data science job market and economy?  Is there any crisis we are facing? Please make a video if possible!!
Good book suggestion and the time to publicise its values. I finished Young's book at the end of last year, and it really helped me be a more attentive learner. I utilised a Trello board to track down the list of resources - following the meta-learning principle.
Fully agree with you on the other parts as well like directness and feedback. I found that to be the keystone habit for me in last few months, as I always regurgitate information to the point where I can explain concepts like JOINs/LEFT JOINs without having to refer repeatedly to other resources. 
Thanks Ken!
Nice man. I've been trying to get a copy of Ultralearning but Amazon's all backed up on shipping because of the situation üòÖ
yes
Another quality video Ken! I love non fiction books, so this "review a book and apply it to data science" type of style is right up my alley. I think it brings in a lot more video ideas too!
I started my data science course work based on your suggestions thanks KenüòÄ
Great video! I would love to see you do live streams and engage with your audience. Your channel is small enough to talk to your audience but should take advantage of that before it goes big ;)
Good job, thanks for the video.
If you would be interested in me doing a live stream where I review resumes or projects, please let me know in the comments below! Ultralearning Book: @t
Keep going pro
Thank you, Ken! ü§ó I‚Äôm taking up algorithms from scratch right now, just the basics, and you often mention, that data science is about using the best way to solve the task. This kinda scares me. Are there, in reality, effective and reliable ways to make sure, that the algorithm and solution for a task were chosen correctly. Should I be less scared by this? I‚Äôve just started learning, and for me this seems, that experimenting can be endless. Would be cool, if you break or confirm this fear ü•¥thank you again, I love your videos! ü•∞
Videos where you review someone's projects and CV would definitely be valuable. Keep up the good work! :)
Hey Ken, Great video! Right now I‚Äôm in the beginning phase. I am enrolled in Johns Hopkins course for data science due to employment benefits and it‚Äôs free. Since Hopkins is biostatistics and clinical research based, the course is taught in R. I am learning because I want a job in data science, but not exclusively in biostatistics. I also prefer Python over R. My question is: should I enroll in another course that is Python based and focus on that for a more generalized approach or should I just stick with the Hopkins course? Thank you!
Hey Everyone - It looks like the free 365 data science courses offer has expired. The rest of the resource that I mentioned in this video are free though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4
Hey Ken, I am watching this video late but I have started learning from now...  Thanks for video...
Thanks Ken...just seeing this.  Also, that is a sick LLBean fleece!  For real no joke I had one identical to it and wouldn't replace it with anything.  Comfy as a MF'r!!!  Love you're videos and the no non-sense fluff approach.  Just getting started in DS, Python, R and Sports Analytics but have set goals and want to take it far.
Hey Ken, the dropbox link provided isn't working. Cheers.
Would you recommend I learn a language like python first before I dive in to data science?
thanks for such wonderful word Ken !! But the link you shared above is redirecting to Udemy and are not free
HI Ken,
Great Video, I have a question about the project. Any recommend project to build for portfolio. I have done couple real estate analysis and 2 recommendation project. I want to explore more on the machine learning part during this break.
Hey Ken, what tools should I have on my laptop to use for python data science projects? Do you use an IDE?
Hey Ken, Great video. I‚Äôm actually improving my python skills during this time. FYI you got some good Towards Data Science articlesüëç
The only constant in data science is that it's always changing! It's important to always learn new technologies. Thanks Ken for the motivation!
Great video as always, but I will say this is a serious understatement.  Now that I'm out of work,  I am ever so glad that I have decided  to pursue this career path. Three great reasons to pursue data science: 1. Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose. 2. Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety. 3. A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path. I think these are solid enough reasons to purse this field.
Thanks for finding the positives during this time of uncertainty
still no discord?üòÇ it‚Äôs okay i‚Äôll keep waiting haha
Thanks Ken, just found your channel! 


Was an engineer in college, but drifted towards fitness and nutrition coaching as my career went on. 


Industry is rocked right now, so I'm learning some Data Science on the side, and your videos are helping :)
Great video. When you say you expect the work culture to shift towards employees working from home, do you mean in the short-term i.e. while the pandemic is still going on, or do you see this just being the "new" working environment? Interesting insight.
Can you suggest a good youtube channel or website for learning a good amount of python for data science.
Thankyou ken
Whenever I see that Ken Jee notification I drop everything I'm doing to watch it
Couldn't agree more. Working on a data set about the virus during this time. So many people have created really insightful notebooks on Kaggle already!
I‚Äôve been learning a lot using my iPhone and I‚Äôve gotten to that stage above the usage of a phone, kind of difficult getting a laptop but hopefully someday  I‚Äôll be able get one to practice with, Thanks for your motivations.
Sooooo true!!!  No one is realizing that without data scientists right now, millions more would die! They need people to work through statistics on illnesses,  especially COVID-19! Good video!!
I have no idea why but when I download images using fatkun, they don't save as image files. They are just saved as a "File" or "Virtual device driver" and I can't actually open them. I have no idea why lol but I'm working on it. I want to see what CNN thinks about classifying hot dogs vs sandwiches.
I'm getting a "Your training set is empty" - error from the code at 8:30. Really stuck on this
Hi Ken :) Not sure if you'll see this comment because YouTube keeps deleting it. I have just finished the project and deployed it :__Ibraheem761/Moroccan-Pastries-Classifier__ ( This is the link to the github repo - hope the youtube algorithm accepts it now ) .. Thank u for always being here for us
Not yet ready for AI but liked it.
I tried this project on google colab. I have used images of animals data to image assistant batch image downloader for downloading images. Also, FAST AI is a really cool repo for this. As always thank you Ken for the video...

Hi,
you can use a grid search for optimal parameters to optimize the times processing or Stochastic grid search.
Thanks for sharing.
Thanks for this video!
I hope you could make more videos like this. It could be helpful also for you to understand it more. Thank you so much!
Hey Ken!


This definitely is a great tutorial but I'm also a beginner as well just like the others.


Could you possibly do some simple beginner projects from start to finish using the Spyder IDE ?


Definitely have the time on my hands now due to the corona virus and i feel that would be a big help to me and the other beginners out there !
Hi Ken, loved this video! Could you do a Clustering one? Stay safe!
Cool üòç
can anyone tell the chrome extention?
I have been looking similar kind of project to recognise company logo‚Äôs... Thank you !! It will help me build my own project
I absolutely love this!! Finally something specific to learn from. Do more do more. Have you ever tried the intel Movidius neural compete stick btw? And another question. Are you skilled with NoSQL? I just had a term paper using Cassandra, MongoDB and Neo4j. I got an 89% on it. I could almost cry. I put everything into that. Used 3x the time estimation. I might actually complain about the grade. But I have the same professor In 3 courses next year, it might not be smart. Anyway! Keep doing ones like this. They will get me trough the courses :)
Very interesting video Ken. Thanks a lot!!


One question regarding Google Colab though. Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup? I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use?


Also, I recently got into Work From Home setup and it seems to me that you have a very minimalist-style setup where you can focus on your work efficiently. Would you be willing to share your setup if you don't mind in your future video?

Hoping you are staying safe as well!
Thank you for this project!  How hard do you think it‚Äôll be getting a job now? With all the corona stuff happening? Do you think it‚Äôs the same probability of getting a job but I just have to work harder and be better? Like same probability, higher standards
I love this, You should make more like these. but start with simple/basic end to end projects and progressively make it harder.
Great content! Looking forward to more projects!
Thank you so much !
The data science sample code is located here! https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/data_science_starter
I am in search of some words of advice/encouragement. I have a M.Ed degree and am going back to school for computer science. Because I already have a Masters, the school stated that I can jump right into the masters program they offer. I am excited, but super nervous that I will lack a lot of knowledge needed already for the program. Thoughts? Advice? 

I am working in Codecademy over the Computer Science pathway they offer to try and get a better grasp, but I am still seeking input of a professional already in the field.
Thanks a lot ken I was feeling very nervous and disheartened after putting 5 days in working and couldn't even complete half of the business analysis. 
I was very confused . But after watching this video i got some real motivation. Thanks alot my friend‚ô•Ô∏è
Thanks Ken, you're genuine input created high spirit for newbie like me entering the DS world.
Hey Ken . Its ok for the experienced data scientists . I have observed myself constantly looking for help on google or stack overflow on simplest topics as well. Can you make video for beginners on how to practice the data wrangling so it can become strong neural path for the same tasks. Thanks üòä
This is one of those open secrets. Presenting is no problem. A live coding session is scary.
Thank you for sharing github link it is really helpful.... most of time our time get consumed in finding how to get started........
Nice topic, I love your channel
2:00 good idea
I started keeping a journal (handwritten) of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again.  The journal is long, but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know I‚Äôve solved before.  

I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process.  It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything.
Best video ever!!! I feel so much better about learning to become a data scientist. And now I have a great resource I can use for my own code. Ken is awesome!!! 

#66daysofdata
I love it when the video is exactly what's on the title. 
No dragging and down to the point. 
Thank you sir
Completely agreed. However, would this be a step after you get proficient with coding in python and stats/machine learning algorithms for coding interviews?
I don't think these kind of "secrets" are taking credibility from data scientists. It is not about memorizing every bit of code. It's about knowing how to get help and knowing what you are looking for.
Makes me think you need a good note-taking program that you are comfortable referencing.
You don't know how happy this video made me. I currently have impostor syndrome and I plan on applying to an internship next week. I was worried I wouldn't know enough and that I won't be able to perform to their expectations. Knowing that it's common for DS to reference their old works or constantly use outside resources is such a big relief.  If I end up getting a job, its because of you! You've contributed so much to my growth. 

Thanks for everything Ken!!
You are a hope to all aspiring data scientists.
I clicked the like button right before you mentioned it! üòÜ 
I found this video at the perfect time. I'm at that stage where I realize how much I don't know and feeling overwhelmed and that I'll never be able to recall all of the information I've been learning. It's great to know that I'm on the right track and doing the same thing with how I am organizing my notes. New mantra: It's not shameful that I can't remember everything.
This video makes me feel comfortable. Knowing that referring to outside resources constantly is completely normal sheds my guilty feelings...Thank u ken....
Dope vid
Thanks for sharing
awesome!
Hi Ken for learning data science which programming language you suggest? Python or R
haha when I first started out...I was like..omg I feel like such a fraud....but now I don't mind.  Great video as always!
thanks legend
This video is pretty reassuring! Great content as always.
I needed this, thanks Ken
I am relieved now. I went about writing commands and tried memorizing them and that didnt work. seems I am not the only one to be looking through  stackoverflow during the entire project im working on!
Nice one, Ken. Thanks for keeping it simple!
Thanks Kenüéâüéäüî•Thanks for sharing
I do this all the time .. don't feel bad about myself any more.... thanks !!
Is that an Oura ring?
Most of your videos have 0 likes.

Well done.
Awesome videos Ken, thank you very much! You have a genuine and reassuring way of sharing your knowledge and helpful tips. Couldn't appreciate this enough. A true diamond in the rough. I have seen your subscriptions grow 1k since I subscribed in the morning, meaning Youtube algorithm is doing its thing. Puts a smile to my face. Hope the same for you. Regards
Awesome info! Super straight forward, appreciate it man!
I like your style Ken.  You're not pretentious with your information.  Please keep it up. You're an asset to the community.
üí™üèªKeep going Ken, I was impressed by your NBA project though.
Hello from Norway! Finally I found a channel that actually tells me something concrete about data science. I‚Äôm doing my second year of a data science bachelor, and looking for an idea for a thesis project. Any ideas would be much appreciated:)
Another Great video üëç
Sir , I am 14 years old 
And I am interested in the field of data science because I am interested technical things 
Sir , any tip for me
You are best Ken
I appreciate the video & source code. This is very helpful, thank you.
Helpful as always!
good to see you back
You are awesome. Please be safe.
I think that what worked for me can definitely work for you in this case. You need to be patient and consistent when learning this field. Feel free to comment any questions that you may have below!
Thank you. Currently fluctuating between stage 2 and 3. It brings so much clarity, watching honest videos like this.
Great, I am at stage 1 , after 20 days of starting this journey.
Thank you for your continuous videos about progressing for DS journey
Also I have a small reques for you if possible... I can see some books are there on your table... Can you share which books you read other than data science or any book which you would like to suggest to us?
The best part of your videos is you are doing good research for various learning methods and sharing those with us which motivate or increase our eagerness to implement it... It is like connecting things to grow more...
Ken got that Under Armor sponsorship
Damn good that You have writable version
This is the far best video that i saw on my journey as data scientist. i really wanna thank you. because this was exactly what i wanted to hear.
You have mentioned starting with python or R, but how important is SQL? Do you think learning SQL would be good for someone just learning to code?
Entered stage 2 ...
This is the best DS channel on YT ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you so much ken! i just begin my journey learning data science with no background and your videos rock
Yet another gem of a video, Ken. Thanks!
If I could like this video twice i'd do that. Thanks
Now I know I am at stage 2. I need to practice and learn simultaneously. Thanks Ken
I am on stage 2, let's see how many of us?
Can you point to some projects from kaggle that we should do in stage 2 and stage 3 ??
I see you have a copy of Wayne T. Winston.

Well played.
I 've been learning a lot thru courses and I've learned cleaning data, python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and a few others but the math and algorithms are difficult. ( I haven't done math in school since 2011). I     for sure feel like I'm in the seconds phase of learning. Should  I stop learning the python programming part and just focus more on the math part?
your videos has the best timing, thank you for the useful tips, i`m currently at stage 2 and  using your tips to transition forward a big thanks Ken
i really appreciate You talk and share your experience very smoothly .i am trying House price Advance Regression problem since three months even though i applied feature selection algorithms libraries , sklearn regression models but didn't work .i am stuck. I need help
Great video Ken! 


Suggestion for a future video - "Data Science and the Coronavirus"
As always, great video!


One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, "learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.




It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:


Do you stay within that domain at work?


If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?
If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?


Thanks for the video Ken!
In your opinion is a statistics' degree useful to become a data scientist or is completely useless?
I‚Äôm in the second stage forsure, I hate it, it demotivated me, haven‚Äôt been working as hard because every time I get stuck I see the answer that I could never have though of with functions idek how they got, and I‚Äôm like I‚Äôve been on this problem for an hour. It‚Äôs like macro-patience and micro-results
It is a big honor to get such information from you , thank you so much !
Hello Ken Jee.
Thank you for all the amazing content you always put out. I need help deciding on a budget laptop (used or new) to buy as I have just my started learning. I need something that will be sufficient for the next 1-2yrs of learning/projects till I get a job in the DS field and can afford another.
I am looking to purchase one within a month.
Is it possible to learn Google data analyst course on a tab or phone ??
Thank you for solving my problem for to become a data scientist without having computer.
Hey Jee prop to you. I love using google colab! Though sometimes it gets me scratching my head because they are things you have to do google way. Like imshow that I have to spend all day to figure it out. My only concern using colab is that privacy with google. Some of my data that I would like to use for practice are work related. So I am not sure if it‚Äôs private enough. What‚Äôs your take?
For iPhone users you can download ‚ÄúCarnets‚Äù from AppStore, its GUI is exactly like that of Jupyter Notebook.
Hi there, Mr. Ken! Great content! Anyway, I don‚Äôt have any computer science, IT, or math background but want to be a data scientist. I will be 25 years old two months from now. Is there any hope for me? How long will it take for me to learn data science? Thank you so much, your reply will be appreciated.

When you mention having" some python experience" what does some consist of. I am very new and starting from zero and doing it all on my own from home. i have or currently am taking a few different courses, classes and tutorials . I am interested in the data science, analytics ...i think.  I recently was introduced to Kaggle and have been trying to learn.  I will look at the micro just as soon as i press send. Thank you for your videos and your insight.
Haven't mentioned SQL
You are the best! I have been following your videos for sometime now and I must say you are awesome! As a newbie in Data Science I think I am at the right place to becoming a pro. Thanks Ken!
Awesome list...thanks for sharing Ken Jee :)
And here is me bulk downloading the Udemy course from the archive.
Thanks
Recommend us some data scientists to follow besides you
Thank you!
okay but what about datacamp? is that great also?
You have not stressed upon the maths behind all those algorithms ...is it not so important? Topics like Single Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis are not taught in courses like these as they are mainly focused on practical application. 
So, should I learn these deep maths concepts or it is just enough to get some practical experience to become a data scientist. ???... Please help....
Does it has certification
Are there any free sports analytics courses that you would recommend
I took the Udemy course:  The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 

What do you think about it ?? I have not finished yet, but I am not sure if it is necessary in order to find a job for me. I do not have experience. Furthermore, I am an International Business Administrator.
What are your thoughts on IBM data science for professionals
This is so helpful. Thank  you
Ken you're the GOAT!
Aside from the analysis portion, do you recommend spending a lot of time on data scraping, cleaning, or visualization?
Could you suggest similar resources for R
Thank you!
As someone who is a complete beginner in data science, I really appreciate this video
Any full playlist that of data science you have taught from scratch ?
Thank you so much.
I have a quick question.
I am mid-career and switching to data science.
After completing your suggested course work on this video, how necessary do you believe an MS degree would be?
Thanks again. I look forward to hearing from you. Jackie
let's go
I can't thank you enough right now
You say to work through kaggle but I'm confused, do you mean ALL of the courses on kaggle? Or just a few of the courses? How does it compare to something like datacamp?
Thanks a LOT, sir!!!
Hi thank you for your valuable content.. I am new to your channel..
Can you please tell me the sequence of learning Data science..
Hi I just found your channel and subscribed. I'm working in banking industry now, and interested in developing my career where I can do something with data. I got my degree in accounting and finance and have no experience in programming or technology. Do you think going back to school to learn skills to become a data scientist or taking online courses would do?
Thank you for your sharing! It's very helpful.
Thank you Ken Jew üëçüèª
Thank you!
Thank you!!
love it
Great courses 
Thanks!
Just subscribed.
I wish YouTube had recommended me this 6 months ago... the information you give is just too valuable
So how long it took you to learn data science from scratch?
How to learn practically for example applying the theories in practical real life examples? Thanks
What do you think about codecademy? I was going through it for a while and i feel like its pretty good but im not amazing at data science yet so how do i know
Hello sir, what's specific course that i have to finish ini kaggle? Its just ML courseÔºåpython and deep learning? Is it enough to prepared for ML crash course by Google?
watching u from Germany....keep going. I really needed to hear that, coz I didn't know how to start!!!!!!!   Thanx alot :)
This is soo valuable!
Thank you for this. I have just begun learning python and i can see this video as extremely useful to my learning experience.
Could you specify how to learn form others' notebooks on Kaggle? I'm not sure how to start.
Thank you so much! Also can I get a link for statistics course? I couldn‚Äôt find statistics course on Kaggle! God bless you man! üòÅ
Helps a lots !! Thank you

Great video. Thanks!
Very Nice ‚ù§Ô∏è
You have provided us with very good resources... thank you for that... Ken can you make a video on how to check a feasibility of a any data science project? Actually I tried one project in my college days but initially I thought it will be easy but when I got deeper it was really hard for me to complete and faced many difficulties....
Ken thank you so much for all these informations
Thanks a lot Ken!! Your videos are really helpful üôèüèª
Thank you very much, sharing these informations precious with us.
Wish you all the best!
How is AppliedAI course by Srikanth Verma?
How do I decide which project to pick?
Thank you for your videos!!!! I start to explore the world of data engineering/data science and your videos are what I need!!!
iam watching your videos everyday man , thank you , you are such an inspiration
Hi Ken. I recently started a PhD in soccer analytics. The datasets I will be working with include millions of rows and are highly complex. I don‚Äôt have much data science experience, I know that Python will be the main language I will code in. Any tips for learning sports analytics related programming effectively and efficiently? Is a ground up approach going to be the best way? Thanks
Thank you for continuing to share and add to the community. I started Kaggle and you make a lot of good points about the benefits for the short and long run with it.
Hi Ken, what do you think the Kaggle projects vs some Bootcamp projects?
Great as usual , I've a question...I don't have a college degree neither in computer science or mathematics but just paid courses , and I'm learning constantly from kaggal , is a college degree in CS and Math is a must to become a data scientist or a professional portfolio works?
I've just started with Kaggle course on basic Python, that's amasing! Thank you for all your tips!
Can I get certificate after completing course or project from Kaggle?
Thanks Ken, you‚Äôre the best. I‚Äôm a lawyer who is going to learn data science from scratch. I already know a bit of Python thanks to you. Keep up the good work man!
Please include congnitiveclass.ai it's also very great. Nice job üëç
God bless Ken!! Great information!!
you are my heroe
Hi Ken, Thank you for the video. Question; I'm older and thanks to covid going to be learning from scratch as you said, what should be the first language I start?
I'd start using kaggle from now on. I always love your videos. Great work Ken!
sub well deserved, thanks!
Great! Thank you
Great video, a big thanks on the tips,just got a question: I am currently taking a machine learning course but I am using matlab, can matlab be a substitute for python in this case? and further on in data science, how essential is python comparing to matlab? Cheers!
Wonderful presentation. Thanks very much for all the info!
Now, I am learning about data science field to begin my new career path. This video helps me a lot to guide my way into this field. I‚Äôm currently learning from 365 course and also am looking at other resources for further learning. I would like to say thank you and keep it up on your work. That means to me a lot!
Thanks a lot for the guidance. This doesn't get any better!
What do you think of the Harvard's CS109 course?
Hey Ken, I would like to thank you for your advice and recommendation, keep it up!
Thanks Ken, this is what i have been searching for, Greatly appreciated .
This channel is so underrated
You make Data Science look sexy üòâ
Hi can you help me to decide what should I can do? Like I am working on. SAP CMMS as end user. But I start using power bi for my trends and other calculations. I felt I am good in learning DAX and I like to organize data in power i by making data model ad etc. Now I want to change my career to IT field. Can I go with SAP HANA to or PYTHON like I don‚Äôt know which is best for future job option or can we relate both
Hi. Great videos. I have started learning DS using kaggle and coursera online course by university of Michigan. Right now I am doing it on my laptop which has windows 10, i5 7th gen U processor and 940mx gpu. My question is in future which hardware should I opt for. Should I go for pc or mac?
THANKS FOR THIS AWWEEEEEESOMEEEEE VIDEO....YOURE THE BEST ‚ù§Ô∏è
question ; if someone has statistics bachelor degree but never worked on the major , is it easy to start the career after 8 years of graduation ?
Hello Ken ! I¬¥m from Brasil ! This is courses is for beginer ?
Ohh yeah. Kaggle is so great. You said it all man.
Hey Ken, just wanted to thank you for the great work you are doing. Your channel has become by go-to source of information for data science!
This is amazing! Thank you
Great video!!!
But I wish you mentioned some edx and coursera courses even !!
i love you
Very informative video. Love the tone and your style of talking.
Hi, Ken i just wanted to say thank you so much . I was on youtube all day looking for good  video on data science.  I am trying to get a job on Data Science, i have a degree on international studies, and this is new to me. i just don't know where to start.
Thank you sir, for these recommendations :)
I've just started the path of learning DS and it feels like walking with a small candle inside a huge dark cave.
Thank you and other people like you who guide beginners in their journey. It is recognized that you have big passion for this field!
Thanks Ken , you are the only one make it simple to me, please stay around to answer my questions when I get involved, you are a great person really, thanks again
Bro I am 17. How can I gather experience and knowledge?
Thank you so much for this. Very helpful
Jee,
what about the course that WorldQuant University offers on Data science is it to the standards? The course is free,  can it help one to learn well as a better course material and understand Data science fully
Thank you!
I love this man very much....you are  actually making me a better Data Scientist Thanks
Thank you Ken. You are a very good  instructor
Thank You so much
Thank you for this information. I just have one question: 
How and where can I learn Python Programming from scratch? I have no knowledge in it
Hey man can you recommend a python course and I also have an interest in data science and i have a thing for interactive courses
Hello there. Thanks for these videos, actually i have a query i am on my way on the data science course from 365 careers on udemy. They will provide us with completion certificate.. so does it give any value to my resume? And what ppl ask in interviews for freshers plz make a specific video on it if possible üòóas experienced ppl know how industry works...
Bdw it's great to see that you reply to all the comments... Thank you for showing such efforts.god bless you
Why do I feel this guy is pretty pretty awesome 
keep up the good work man!
thanks for these great recommendations!
Thanks
@ ken jee do u recommend all this 3 programs in that order, as in 1st start with kaggle micro courses, then when done move onto google machine learning crash course ,and then when done fast AI, because towards the end of the video u emphasized a lot on kaggle but did not mention the other 2 programs,so do I need to take the three in that order to grow my understanding in beginning data science or any 1 of the three will do,..please kindly elaborate
Hey .. such an informative video.. thanks .. I have a doubt.. do we get certificates after the completion of these courses? Pls check if anyone can help
Thank you such, I'm lost and your content is just guiding me
Thank You So Much From Morocco Keep Going
Thanks for the informative video! I just wanted to know whether octave platform is useful or jupyter notebooks are much effective for data science/ML
Short and sweet!!! Thank u.
Thanks a lot , which master degree would you suggest and university for data science?
Good video üëç
 I wonder if it's possible to get a remote internship or job in usa or europe and how to get it
thank you for your videos!  Very useful content. üôè
I am from digital marketing now  I am migrating to data science is it need to learn statistics??
Hi Ken-Jee....
Sololearn, the course can be downloaded and you can do it on your phone on the way to work
ken your videos are the best at what they do. thanks
Can you share any small project based on python.
Thanks !!
There is another free YouTube playlist on AI created by DeepMind, one of the leading AI tech firms globally. People check that out it's really simple and well explained.
My question is that they gave the certificates???.....and if they giving then what is the value of it??
you are best
Thanks sir, best youtube recommendation :)
Thank You!!!!!....This is my first ever comment on Youtube as well
What about freecodecamp?
Sir thank-you so much, These resources are really helpful, and "Kaggle" is really amazing,  keep helping us sir !
non-technical or non coding guy here looking for career in IT, pls suggest the non technical roles in IT, data science, blockchain etc., pls help, Thanks
Your video on LSTMs inspired me. Built the same thing with a CNN. Looking forward to learning more on Kaggle now!
Can u pls tell me where can i get cetificated also in free of cost for data sc course??
I've never commented on a YouTube video before, but I just wanted to let future viewers know how great this video is. Great work Ken!
That's sooo cool - Thanks Ken for sharing!
Hey Ken. What are your thoughts on relying on R more than Python for data science?
Hello Ken, thanks for your suggestion. your one suggestion which pricked up my ears was: make a list of packages having vague knowledge. and definitely go through the documentation.
Can you please guide on some of the good IT Courses/Certifications where coding skills are not required?
Thank you sir I have been searching for such free online course. Subscribed to your channel üëç
It is mentioned briefly in this blog You can go through this link to get a brief understanding about the courses.
How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning? - mlarticle-learn about ai and its subsets (https://mlarticle.com/how-does-a-total-beginner-start-to-learn-machine-learning/)
 it should help you good luck!
Do you think the course offered in Kagge too simple? It just gives us an overview about topic in each course.
kaggle is phenomenal. I can't believe how intuitive and generous this is.
What if I want to stick with business intelligence analyst only
Very good one.
Hlw Sir...Will we get certificate after  completion of the course ?? Plz tell
Please is there any platform to get mini projects on R ?
Can you tell me some source for R
Thanks for value informationü§ü
Cool
This feels like a cheat code or something. The information is too valuable and well explained. Thank you
How about those courses on coursera?
Can anyone suggest free best course on statistics for data science
I am an experienced java developer with Python handson. Thanks for this
Hi there. I just found this channel in this week and I wanted to say thank you for introducing me to google colab. I was looking for a way to practice without downloading packages to my computer. Thank you so much
I found your videos last night and so glad! Very informative
Very informative. I have read many blogs about free courses but everything listed here was new to me. One of the best advices I have received 4:05  . Good job and all the best :)
What are python topics to learn for data science ?
Will it be safe for beginners like me ?
Thank you Ken love from india

Hi Ken. I trust you are well. Thank you for your videos. I started watching your videos when I found an interest in data science. I hope there is a way I could perhaps chat with you as I have just a few questions I hoped you could answer?
Ken, do you recommend data science courses from udacity?
Hey. I need to learn statistics from scratch for data science(I am a total beginner). What free and best online materials are there. Please give a link to them.
Great Video Ken. loved the content. Thank you so much :)
How about the courses on edureka?
Thanks Ken, 
What about non-free courses, certificates, or micrometers! could you please some of the high=quality but still affordable ones?
Thanks
Great video Ken üëç Started watching with little expectation, but it turned out to be really informative!
I can see a Mathematics book on your desk. What level of Maths is it, A Level or University first year? What level of Mathematics does one need to have to go into Machine Learning?
I already watched the video but i am here for the second time. For what? I just wanted to thank you. I loved Kaggle. I wish i had started everything from there. So thank you for telling about Kaggle :D
Hey Ken,  great video for a beginner like me, thanks for your time and effort here. wanted to check if you have any recommendations for the Statistics micro-course? thanks.
I love how quick to point your videos are. Not enough YouTubers do this.
Specially thanks to you to share this valuable sites with us. It's been 2 months i stared learn python and planning to do my Master‚Äôs On Data Science. Thank you again.
Is there any place where modelling and graphing is taught as well? Like if I wanted to simulate the motion of billiard balls on a table?
How are the one on Coursera ? I am auditing those ones
What would you say are the prerequisites for kaggle?
Could you share the title of the books on your desk?
Great video thanks!
Yo thank you for the video! really appreciated!
Hello. What if I don't have any programming experience?How harder the journey will be?
Thanks dear for your video, I am a beginner in data science I have passion about it...computer science isn't my present career or study  and and I don't have any experience...how long does it take to learn and work in data ? Thanks in advance
Ty!!
thanks
Great video, thanks for sharing. Best
Thanks for sharing these resources!! Follow up question - any advice on how to either find a data science mentor or group to collaborate with? I‚Äôve been practicing on my own, but think there‚Äôs real benefit from connecting with more advanced professionals to get feedback and keep advancing, but am having a hard time figuring out how to get started here.
Been enjoying your channel. Found it last week
The best.
Hi there, Ken. I really appreciate your content. I am a biomedical scientist who is beginning to use R-studio. Do you have any suggested freely available content like that described in this video for the R platform, which you feel is really solid or underrated?
Great video and great suggestions Ken! Keep it up!
Great video bro!
The best video that I have ever seen in this field. I am new here, and I want to start learning. All the best!
Thank you!
For practical implementation of ML one must start with fast.ai Machine learning or Udacity course for Machine Learning Nanodegree..?
Your videos are great for beginners to learn data science. Great work man!!
Very informative and to the point. I'm very grateful to you for such well explained and beneficial info that cut to the core of learning Data Science. Ken, thanks¬† for all you do!
Good organization.
Any recommendations but for R software?
Can you share the same for Machine Learning in Python and R?
Hey ken!!

Can sigma six green or yellow belt courses on Coursera , would be useful for career advancement in data science ?
I'm new to the channel and I subscribed after watching a couple of your videos. great resources and advice, its just what I was looking for. I have a few questions about this video tho, howcome theres nothing about statistics in the courses you've recommended? I thiought its integral to data science and machine learning. and if so, what other prerequisites do I need?
Thank you for this Ken! Quick question, what is that Mathematics book on your desk? :)
The IBM Data Science specialization course at Coursera.com is a very good course for beginners. I know it isn't free but anyone can get it for free by applying for financial aid at Coursera
You're my Data Science mentor!
Which micro-courses on Kaggle should I take and in which order?
Hi Ken, is it possible for you to create a separate short tutorial on GIT? Or can you guide on resource related to it.
Dropping https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-867-machine-learning-fall-2006/, probably one of the best foundational ML courses I've seen that's completely free and with a proper amount of depth.
Hey, i just want to ask,is data science has a strong relation with accounting? Because i am kinda afraid that i learnt data science but it can't be implemented in accounting and my investment kinda ruined
Does it still make sense to learn python for data science ? Pycaret just came out few weeks ago and now you can do the same work much faster.
That is not data science
Hey, ken, this was an amazing video. I'm just starting with DS and this helped a lot. I also sent a mail to you, can you please check that? Thanks for all the great videos too, keep it up!
What is your opinion about Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera? Would it really help a lot to learn deep learning ?

Plz  make vedio on that
How'd u rate datacamp's Data Science with Python track
Excellent work üëåüëç.(subscribed)

My question is,
Is this course is enough to get job in data science ?
Thank you for your videos Ken. I saw your videos and looked up your LinkedIn profile as well. It mentions your recent experience as a product owner. Would it help to learn data science for future career interest in Product Ownership and Innovation?
Thank you, Ken! This video is great and will be helpful for me. Hope to see you anytime soon!
Hello! I've been trying to figure this exact thing out and I'm so glad this came by
Thanks for the resources!!!!!
But i am bit confused which should i go for , data science or deep learning !!!! Thanks for your help in advance !!!!!
Great work Ken Jee, sharing resources to help people meet their learning goals, there is another free machine learning platform which is excellent, very easy to use and easy to learn www.eazyml.com  we tried it and I think eazyml  is one of the most transparent ML platforms in the market, their promise is, "Learn ML By doing  ML"..Good luck..
Any suggestions for learning computer vision and Deeplearning
In order to learn data science is it necessary to learn deep learning and ai?
What are your thoughts on ML course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, its the most famous out there and is completely free.
I wish I came across your channel earlier. I wouldn't have wasted so much time finding the right resources amongst the overwhelming amount of resources out there for learning Data Science.
Hi.. I loved your videos. I am learning Data Analyst (NOT Data Science) with Python (https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/16) from Datacamp and from some other sources as well. Do you think is Data Analyst is a good path in terms of career perspectives. I am 31 years old and not good with ML stuff. Appreciate your time and answer.
Thanks Ken, your videos are very insightful!
Hi Ken, I just wanted to spend a little bit of my time to thank you for all this great stuff you share with us.

You have made me feel the motivation to learn something new, which I had been missing for a long time. Besides, this might even mean the change for a more rewarding career I had been looking for.

Please keep sharing, we will support you.
Thanks again and stay safe during these tought corona times :)
Great channel!
Your work is very inspiring, I really do enjoy watching your videos. Great motivation to go on building my data science career. Thank you so much. üëç
How is machine learning by Andrew ng ?? Course
I like the style of the video, very didactic, well organized content.
That was really helpfulüëå
Are the courses given in the link above free? 
Is the course in kaggle link free?
I watch your video first time and they are amazing and exactly what I want. 
I know intermediate level of python so what should I do now?
hi sup? u know which platforms or web that offers FREE certificates ? thx
Thanks for sharing this .üëè
What courses should one take for probability and statistics?
Thank you so much for your guidance!  This is some life changing advice for someone committed to finding a new, rewarding career.
Thank you very much. It seems a very informative video. Just like it.
Really Thanks man !! 
I do appreciate your Contents. 
Hope that your channel grows more.
TQVM. I will have to check out your other  videos on DS projects.
You're channel is great. You deserve more followers!
If I were to want to get a job in this field would it be enough to learn these free courses and the information and to relay what I have learned to the hiring manager? Or would I need to get some sort of certification? Thanks.
I really like your structured video content and explanation. thanks and keep making videos
Thankyou Ken.
Love from India :)
this video was really helpful and put my mind at ease! really practical and clear instructions :) thank you Ken. keep up the good work!
This was a surprisingly good video
Ken, I think that IBM Cognitive Classes are really good as a starting point!!!
How a out datacamp? I subscribed a 12month but have not started yet.
365 data science have udemy courses and their website plans. l just bought their  udemy courses on sale. do you know what rhe fundamental difference is?
I have enrolled courses on "Coursera". Is it okay to go through them because most of courses on Coursera are basic ?
I use DataQuest, it‚Äôs free to start and see if you like it then it‚Äôs like $30 a month, i didn‚Äôt like DataCamp because it was video based
What do you think about Udemy's Data Sciense courses, Ken?
Wow this is actually very very helpful !! Thanks KenüòÅ Keep making videos.
@Ken Jee could plz tell how much time does it take to create a project?
as i am in the process of learning ml and data sciene so it would best to know about ??
So handsome and yummy. A guy with substance. I like.
Very interesting....I was feeling some regret on the lack of perfection in thesis but I suppose I have more to learn
Can you do one based on Data Analytics projects?
Beginners looking for motivation  should watch this. Even though our projects accuracy or prediction not good, Still we have learned many things in the journey. Like Ken did,  we need to understand why it failed and move on. After advancing our level in DS we can surely revisit our projects and improve them. Thanks for the video Ken.
Does it make more sense to stick to One particular field  (Sports) or would it make more sense to diversify (sports, environment, finance etc etc)
Is Kaggle better for a Data Science portfolio?  Or is Github the way to go?  Thanks in advance!!
O my god, This videos is just make me wanna learn more and click more damn, thank you man! Lots of love
I watch your videos that are awesome. I am a biggner and want to learn data science form very zero. Soo.. plz tell me from where I should start my journey?
Fantastic Videos Ken! Your videos are the reason why I am still going on with my personal projects. I ain't no master but I still try.
Hey Ken,  What did you do with the UFC? Could you create a video or share that on Github? Thanks
Sir, can you make video on how to get into sports analytics ??
Hi! Thanks Ken. I got some really useful info from your video!
Hi Ken
You doing an Awesome job my making all this quality informative videos. I wanted to discuss something with you, so is there any way i can shoot you an email? I will really appreciate that!
Regards
I watch your videos regularly. Why dont you make a video of making a project from scratch for the beginners.
üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
Great video! I love your consistency in producing valuable videos with relevant topics. Cheers!
Ken Jee , Please help me.
I'm currently debating if I want to choose Business analytic vs Data Science.
I have read so many comparison about it but some of these info are outdate or 1side opinion. I want ur opinion on this.
Here is my goal:
Owming my own business and using Data Science to give my business an edge over my competition. 

But now I came across a new major call "Business Analytic". I was wondering if Data Science are too broad of a subject for my goal in comparison to Business Analytic which sound more specific?.
Data science + sports analytics = subscribed
I like your content a lot .. my comment is can you make your speech less scripted? Or it is just ur style of doing it idk .. anyway good job
Thank you for all these insights and videos you are doing about data science!
I really love your videos, very clear and easy to understand. It's a crime that this channel is not more popular
Can someone tell me the background music plz?
Since you can integrate data science in business, can you make data science a business? Like an AI company? Or is that not data science?
Thank you! I remember I asked you to do this video. I hope that it would help many and become one of the most viewed videos on your channel!
I have worked in companies where people are not bought in with data science, where software engineers feel like their work is way more important. Happy to have seen your video.
my question about data science is: can there be science without data?
Is saturated anyone Persuing it in 2021 will fail and I repeat you will fail no matter how hard you try 
You need 6 research paper and patents to get into any phd program 
Good luck getting that
I am 17 and starting with data science, I think this is gonna help me while getting my first job , thank you :
)
I want to ask unrelated question, do you still programming/coding when working as a data scientist?   Or just focusing more on statistic?
Awesome! , this is happening to me with my actual clients. THANKS
I concur Nice tips
üëçüèΩ
For those wanting more specifics on the Linear and logistic regressions: For both models the p value of bangs was not significant. For the linear regression, the R-Square was ~.02. Thanks for watching and remember to comment with your thoughts on this scandal! -Ken
I actually watched the baseball games to understand the game... How it works, how points system works and many other things...

I also replicated the code into spyder and need to study the code more and need to understand it

I also watched Astros game and I think they used signs to manipulate the shots... I still understand the whole matter but these things should not happen because it reduces the interest of people...
Ken,


Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.  If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations.


Really looking forward to part two.  Baseball analytics is a particular favorite of mine!
How did I miss this upload? Keep up the good work.
another good analysis would be a batters Hitting average home vs away. There's theory that some teams were doing the same thing for home games. The batters with a much greater batting average at home vs away can be telling.
How high level of coding do you use?
I actually just found out that the by inning / at bat data exists! I will hopefully be adding a part 2 to this video with that analysis!
Ken - Any data by individual batter? How do we know if the stolen sign was correct? Since a batter only has a second or so to react to a pitch thrown, what if some batters might do better if they didn't believe they knew the sign and, therefore, might overthink the at bat? So far, you won't be able to answer these questions. However, can you split the sample by runners on base vs no runners on base? (btw, I still need to respond to the info you sent regarding 2 point conversion. Thx for that!)
After two days of searching and troubleshooting and frustration, this video has explained what nothing else I was finding could! Thank you!üôè
How did you uninstalled the anaconda you had
Thanks Ken
I love how the video is so well structured!!!
Hi, I updated my Spyder in Anaconda, and it is broken as I stopped it because the install took too long. So my idea is not using Spyder in the base env, but create another but I want the libraries that come by default in the base env. Is there a way to install all of them easily without looking for them on by one? Many thanks
ok
install all (like jupyter, spyder vs code ) for every new environment ????????????? is it ???
Sir I install anaconda but when I lunch jupyter it give me error and exit code error what should I do
Thanks a lot ken for such a wonderful and easy to understand video for anaconda insallation. It is really helpful for me and many more....
Thanks, one of my modules is business intelligence analysis this term. This helped me understand the basics
Hi Ken. I am new to your chennal. I have a question to ask. My organization was using free source of anaconda before. Now I have informed by my IT team that this is now licenced however I am unsure which version Should we install between commercial edition,team edition and enterprise edition. Our requirement is to have jupyter and Spyder and numpy and panda framework. Initially we raised request for teams edition but later got to know that it doesn't have Spyder and jupyter. Should we need the commercial edition instead? Will it have required packages mentioned. Thanks
Hi, thanks for the video, but I downloaded anaconda, I also installed but when I run the small table displays then disappears but anaconda is not displayed. what to do? thanks
this video doesnt explain or demonstrate anything about devs enviroment or how to save your work
Ken, I appreciate you. üíõ
After the installation of anaconda there is no prompt and navigator. And I can‚Äôt find a solution. Do you have maybe a solution for my problem?
What about pycharm?
thanks for this video Ken. What do you think are the advantages of Conda against say pipenv? I see conda used a lot, but I'm trying to understand if it makes sense for me to shift
Hey Ken! Recently many articles and news sites stated that data science is gonna extinct in the future. Is it really true? Could u share your opinion about this.
Thank You Sir God bless You
Hey Ken, great video. I actually installed everything perfectly but when I try to open the anaconda navigator directly, it does not open. Is this an installation issue?
Thank you so much for this video the first time I tried doing this my laptop's fan began to spin like crazy and heat up.  This time nice and chill
U haven't told how to set up an environment and then all the things
#66 + 6: Great go-to for the installation process... I didn't knew that from Terminal is possible to open Jupyter, R or Spider. I will try it for sure!!!
#66daysofdata
It's telling that you had to uninstall and reinstall Anaconda.  I get the impression that these kinds of broken installations are commonplace in Python world.
My User folder has a space in its name so the anaconda installer warns me that several packages will face problems, what to do?
Right now I am trying to install anaconda so will it be fine to use the python 3.8 version? because I heard python 3.7 is a stable version but that is not available on anaconda.
Hello, I have a question about the keras model. My keras model project take long time like 1 day and the data update every week, can we save the model? One more if we can save the model can we update data than going learning with this model or we start over?  Tensorflow v2.4, py v3.8
I also used anaconda during my graduation in my final year project but I just used the prompt for activating conda and then running my project interface but this is good that I can use environments directly.  Thanks for showing all the command details here...
I don't get this. You title this video Anaconda beginner and then don't do anything with Anaconda!
Hello,Ken! Is anaconda good for beginners? Thank you!
Hallo i have opened the spyder and I installed the kite. Kite has all significant packages such as numpy pandas?
Do i need to install python too if I have anaconda?
Hi ,i have followed all the steps yet i couldn't find  either anaconda prompt or anaconda navigator  in search menu .Please help me
ken you are the top!
Hi Ken, 

Would you script your whole project in Spyder then if you wish to share it copy and paste it to Jupyter with markdown where necessary? I'm just wondering why not skip the middle man and use Jupyter all the time.

Take care thanks for all the great info!
I just removed all of python, pycharm, anaconda from my computer and followed along. i reinstalled anaconda and then it will not let me open any of jupyter notebook spyder or anything. the error is an import error? please help
thanks
Thanks
Thanks for this intro and starting with anaconda, it very easy to follow. i had been using jupyter since 365, kind of only one i used. i understand spyder can see the variable and dataframe easily. i have a question for the same code and dataset, which will run faster? spyder or jupyter? Thanks
It's really  cool to see Python and Anaconda fight in jupyter planet, like an R rated movie,.. Haha
Two questions (as I haven't installed Anaconda yet) : 
1) Isn't there an Anaconda manager that allows to create and switch to different environments? I mean, you used code lines in cmd but if I'm not wrong that should be done by just clicking some commands in Ananconda navigator. Am I wrong? 
2)Tensorflow is a pain for my python version (3.7). Which python version/environment do you suggest for installing and using Tensorflow successfully?

Thanks
great vid sweet and to the point thanks for this
Im.ramnivas
This saved my butt. I was searching all over the net for how to use Spyder in different environments and nobody had explained it properly. 
Thanks Ken.
Do you recommend it over PyCharm?
Is it only for windows 10 or else we can install on windows  7 also?  I‚Äôm having my project please do reply sir
Hey is jupyter notebook too slow to run, Everytime I login again after a break I have to rerun all the cells and still notice some of the cells are unexecuted ,it's like running a same codes for many a times before you move ahead it's so frustrating ,is their a way to handle all this ?
How to change spyder to dark theme?
Hey ken, cheers for another detailed video.
I recently finished my first side data analysis project, and have added it to a github to show on my resume.
What next steps do you suggest for me? Is there any way to get my project reviewed for any feedback?


Thanks!
Hello Ken,
I started studying Data Science last year, and since them your channel helped me a lot with a lot of tips and advices.

Thanks, I'm glad this was helpful
It is very good information, for the people who are new to DS learning. Thank you Ken once again.
Thank you for the recommendations.
hey man thanks for the motivation to push on
Thankyou so much Ken. When I started to watch your videos, I got an idea about how to start learing data science, Where should I start....üòçü•∞
Thank you, you are great
Thank you for your helpful tips. Nice, to the point brief. Keep updating.
Perfect.video.for.anyone to start off in Kaggle with a great learning practice path. Thanks
Your the GOAT Ken! Your channel and in-depth breakdowns have been invaluable to my studies. Thank you!
Thank you, very interesting!
üòç‚ù§
thanks alot ken
 ,would you tell me what i have to learn(tools) to be able to go through this three projects
Very nice
I just finished basic to python and library so when I can be able to check  this projects?
It's really difficult to read your screen, it's too small
I am a physicist, and I need to learn data, science, and machine learning for experimental physics, material science, 2D material Identification (their quantum properties, and so on). as It seems, I must learn it if I wish to survive in my knowledge domain.
Sir we want you to please do a live project with us!!! üôèüôè
Hi, I want to lean data analytics for my term paper in college and i have to make a basic project on it. So i wans hoping if anyone can tell me from where to start data analytics and is there any discord server or group which can help me . 
-- Thanks a lot
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Great Content. 
You really explain things in layman terms. Thankss!
i'd like to try cyber security with data science
thank you
great tips
This is a great help, I am a bachelors student and I really want to be able to give value in future. I‚Äôve been wondering how to start learning by experience and this video encouraged my search. Thanks.
Hi Ken. I totally relate with everything you‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm currently in grad school and it‚Äôs a struggle grasping the concepts and being expected to apply these concepts towards successfully completing the program
Hey Ken I have some data that rates menu items as keep, change or n/a - how do I analyze this?
Thank you for the video. I can now see a way to begin. I always thought when doing a new thing, where to start is the most difficult step.
Watching in early 2022. I really like this breakdown of process and how to think about solving problems. I'm a musician, producer and recording engineer and a lot of these....learn-by-doing and divergent thought processes remind me a lot of how to get a good mix or composing. Really excited on this journey
One thing I appreciate about your videos is how you tell us about the challenges we will face as beginners but give us the assurance of overcoming these challenges. Thanks for this video. It means a lot to me.
Helping the algo.
What should we know before we start these projects?
Any recommendations for Kaggle projects that focus on r ?
Can we create a data science project that connects the different patterns of star system to know if they are constellations or not?
love it!
Finally we have someone on internet who is really putting you on the right path of learning data science and ML, thanks a tonne! I was completely lost and frustated, I will recommend this channel to my friends and colleagues.
video starts at 2:10
Thanks Ken, any prerequisite basic knowledge that is required to start digesting these projects and trying them out?
I‚Äôve always learned new technical stuff specifically in on-job learning format far better than classroom setup. Want to start learning ML, should I start with these projects without any other prerequisites?
Hey, this was helpful, I am looking for big data to process and analyze thru Hadoop and python. Do you have any resources ?
Started with Coursera and I'm so glad YouTube recommended you. Will definitely be using Kaggle. Thanks so much
One question 

A very first day of learning and I am land to this video is it worth if I cross educate myself?
Thanks for tips!
ken i have completed intro and intermediate  of ml can i start with a project now?
Thanks ken, absolutely great videos :)
Hi, I'm relatively new to the data sciences field. I conducted a social experiment and survey for my class to determine the level of susceptibility to disinformation, controlling for both weekly online hours and strength in political party affiliations. The results were interesting, but I wanted to improve on the experiment by:
1. increasing the number of participants
2. improving the set of questions
3. collecting which sites had the most activity for each participant on a given week. 

This would be considered a regression problem, yes? Since I am attempting to predict performance based on consistent behavior. What programs would be considered ideal to collect this type of data for my analysis?
Really great video! Just what I needed. Thanks üëç
great . . .  thank you
As a newstarter: Kaggle.com and jump straight into tutorials and projects, or 360 Data Science and go through a structured course? Be honest
I think I'm pretty late to comment, but your content is really helpful and since learning data science can be overwhelming at times, your content balances out that just fine.
Thanks for creating such helpful content.
P.s :- I think you use algo to like all the comments XD jk
Thanks for the quality content!
Best video. Looking forwars to your vidoes.
3:00
#66 + 5: Great timing as always!!!
I know, my next step is Kaggle üëç I‚Äôm studying these concepts, which will be great to put into practice! üè° Yay!
#66datsofdata
Thank you!.
How about Dataquest, is it good for beginners too?
Looking handsome jee.u always ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you
Thank you
Thanks definitely adding weight in YT algorithm.
I am just starting out my journey in the field of data science and I find your videos to be really informative and at the same time motivating too.
It was so kind of you to share your personal experience, thoughts and knowledge about what you know to the world.
It really shows how a person's ability lies in their will.
So, I really thank you and wish for great life ahead. üòäüòä
I'm on the way of data scientist, kaggle python learned, now I'll again learn python from utube videos, than ml and neural network deep network and side wise kaggle projects. So how's my plan sir
Good stuff! Thank you for sharing. I am taking online courses and your videos give me helpful insights. I also like the short length of your videos which is very efficient. Thanks!
Great video
Thx!
The Jon Snow of data science.
Love the "Modular, Git-R-Done" approach of Kaggle learn and these projects!
Awesome video. Its so helpful for beginners like me.
Clear as water, thanks
Thank you, Data Professor.
The iris dataset is ideally suited for regression, classification, and clustering projects for beginners. Working with a single dataset and learning which types of machine learning algorithms are possible and appropriate can reduce the time before you can tackle resume-worthy projects. Another useful skills is the ability to compare approaches (regression vs. classification vs. clustering) so you are ready to make recommendations to your manager or client or even your team about why a certain approach or algorithm is better-suited to the task at hand.
I am a beginner as a data analyst and looking for projects to practise with, I didn't learn ML yet so if any projects I can practise for my situation would be great.
and if I used the data given in titanic project and build some prediction but without using ML, would that be right?
Can we apply linear regression on titanic project?
Thanks üôèüèªüëåüèªüíØ
thanx. There is 1 funny thing: your screen backround is so inperfect ...It was  annoying me during the whole viedeo. Put that ball in that damn hole! :))))))
Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer.
Do you think smaller projects like these could be fine for an internship resume's?
Awesome video man!!!
Also, I wanted to ask if you could talk about how you would approach building a model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) bcoz no matter how hard I try I don't understand how to go about it.
This clip is your best clip that suits me üòéthx bro
cool !!!!!!!!
Thanks for saying "don't get overwhelmed"! Find your videos very helpful. Keep posting, Ken!
Any good data sets for a time series project? Or anomaly detection?
thanks)
Hello Sir I want to start my MS career in Data Science I need your help sir.
Can u suggest me which projects are best to build my resume .I am very interested in data science.i am trying to get an intern as a data scientist . Can u also suggest me which companies are best to apply.
Thanks in advance :) üôÇ
Can you please link your wallpaper?
Thanks
Hi Ken, I just finished my one-year data science study. However, it seems that I learned many things but I can not apply them well. I do not know how should I prepare to find a job. Statistics, Python, SQL, and R, they are just like familiar strangers to me. Can you give me any suggestions? I do not know where I should start. Thank you!
Great content man, I'm from Peru and I can't stop  watching
I struggle with things that take a long time. If I spend several years to become a master, what will I I actually have in the end? I will be able to predict some things. I guess the hardest thing for me to think about is that 5 years will be gone and will it be worth it. Maybe by then AI will do everything automatically. Like trying to program an operating system with assembly language or something.
I started going through the Kaggle courses. The big picture makes sense, but I always forget syntax and stuff.
upvote for sports analytics projects!
Hello Ken and all data scientists here,
I just started my Data science journey and currently I am going through Machine learning.
In ML course which I am enrolled they mostly use sklearn library to build models.
Is that a best approach or should I learn building model from scratch?
thanks for the recommendations. I am a sas user instead of Python or R although i just started to learn Python ... any suggestions ?
Nice video Ken, thanks for explaining it so well, easy to get frustrated with learning! So I don't need to be a data scientist to get a job in data science, In the process of learing python, data analysis looks to be a good area to get work in where i live, am i on the right track?
Amazing information ken!
Your videos are raw and genuine you have earned a subscriber today.
Thanks for the amazing efforts you put on this..
Will start with the housing
Thanks Ken I'm a spanish computer professional. I'm trying to introduce in ML world to change my career and your videos have help me to center my studies.
Hello Ken,

Thanks for making this informative video.
I have finished the basics of python and the Pandas course on Kaggle. I'm planning to pick Geospatial analysis and my next pick. Am I good to go to proceed to hands-on these projects? If not, could you please refer me to what should I pick next.
Hi Ken, thanks a lot for these informative videos.. For a beginner, to whom this video is intended, how many weeks would it take to complete these 3 preliminary projects? Lets say, if one were to devote a couple of hours every day to work on these ( 2 hours is an guesstimate because at this preliminary stage, most learners are balancing full time job or education ).. I ask this, because I want to follow the path but not have unrealistic expectations and beat myself.. at the same time, I would like to know what a reasonable timeframe for completion would be..
Is it necessary to do a online course to become a data science?
This is what I'm looking for, thanks
Hey Ken,
Hope you are doing well. Thanks for an awesome video. I recently started following your videos and the content is too good.
I had a query related to the career options.
I am an experienced professional working on SAP BW (data warehousing solutions), and lately I have developed interest in learning python to add to my skill set. Since I am related to analytics, I wanted to know how fine it would be for me to move into field of data science or data engineering.
Any suggestions is highly appreciated.
Btw thanks for accepting my connection request on LinkedIn.üôÇ
Hello am a beginner in machine learning, I want to work on a sales forecasting project. Is there any way you can help me with tutorial videos. Thank you
Hi Ken, Thank you very much for sharing these info!! I am following you as a guide for my Data Science journey, so I really appreciate everything you do! Currently I am an account Manager but I feel burning in me the love for data science. Data are my daily bread, so I would like to manage data in a deep way and creating new value by doing it.  I agree that the best way for learning Data Science is by doing projects, so do you think that the best could be finding projects for "beginners" on Kaggle or it could be better to do Kaggle projects without any kind of "limit" (so in this case just with the purpose of increasing skills by doing different kind of data analysis)?  Thank you again Ken and have a great day :)
Great
Thanks for the tips!
5:44 I believe MNIST images are 28x28. So it would be 784 pixels per image
Ghhh
Ghhnn
Nice! Having joined Kaggle recently, and due to one of your recommendations (thanks and kuddos by the way :D ) ... I feel that I am now ready to start these kind of projects. Since I did followed successfully the two first courses of Frank kane, it seems like a natural progression for me.
Very helpful video man. You've gained a sub
I started studying Data Science in April, I'm definitely going to be working on these projects. Thanks for this channel it is awesome! I just found it...please continue to make quality content :D
Hi Ken, your videos are very educational. Thanks a lot for putting out this content. I'm trying to combine my experience in working in start-up finance to transition to data science. What do you think the challenges will be coming from a non CS background?
hi ken, i have been learning data science with python after losing my job in pandemic as web developer(wordpress, html, php etc) . can i get a good job.. do i have a good chance??
Hey Ken! I'm from India. I still have three left until the completion of my college degree. I just now learnt python. I  wanna purse my career in data science, so where should I start from? Thank you :)
Thanks to you .From two weeks I was confused where to start in kaggle keep it upüëç
Ken i have question? 
Can a mechanical engineer student apply for masters in data science colleges in uk/canada/europe ?
I want to analysis some data on people reaction over Facebook in COVID-19 pandemic. Will you kindly suggest me some project on it, that will be very helpful for me.
Thanks Ken,  once I have finished learning the fundamentals (midway through online course and Kaggle courses), will get these done,  your videos are very helpful!
I think the point you make around 6:30 is a really good one in general for all forms of science and engineering. It's really about practice at the end of the day. We're not born math geniuses, we learn math through repetition and problem-solving. Same thing applies to data science and programming. The more you practice it, the better you get and little by little the overwhelming problems seem a little less... overwhelming :)
Good info
Hello. I am 1 week into learning Python. Sorry for this dumb question but is data science part of machine learning?
Excellent content, thanks!
Is it possible to do these in R?
Hey Ken, apart from the Kaggle micro course, could you recommend a Coursera course (or the like) to better understand ML for a beginner?
Superb dude!!Thank you
From last one month I am learning data science but I was little bit confused that where should I apply this knowledge but after watching your video now I can do some projects in data science
Thank you.....!üòä
i like to watch your videos...
being a lecturer and learner its really helps me to catch right path for learning 
all the best..love from INDIA
I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

I was planning to take an IBM data science course on EdX. It's good to know about Kaggle. I'll check them out. Thanks for this presentation, good stuff.
This is really helpful. Thank you Ken
What are the pre-requisite for these projects i.e python, R, Sql or a person who has completely no background of coding can do it??? Please do reply!!!
Thank you for the tip, I knew about titanic dataset but wasan't aware of the others in kaggle (exept in courses where they used it)
Is it overkill to solve one of those with deep learning or do you recommend the basics of supervised ML?
Thank you, that's great video!
Thanks for the tips, expecially the part were you mentioned that you have passed the fear and it is a natural process of learning, because i am having that feeling now,  there are so many things to learn.
Are there any prerequisites for starting with these project. Like in my case i know basic python and    i  am okay at stats but i have no  knowledge about  machine learning topics.
I am a computer engineering student here in ph trying to find a topic/problem to solve for my thesis. Any ideas you might have?

This is literally the first video I'm looking on data science, and I was a little bit scared of beggining it, but you gave me a lot of confidence when giving these resources and tips! Thank you m8
I really want to thank you as I already have done first 2 projects  during this lockdown. I realized that everything is possible to learn. You are very good person for sharing the invaluable knowledge.
Outstanding video ...love the way you break it down to the bare essentials , as to how we should approach the development of this new set of skills...   :-)
Hey, thank you very much for this video it has been really helpful. I watched and learned some basic statistics and linear algebra from miycourseware lectures, and i did this to build a base to like start data science. I want to go into the use of data for business intelligence, and I'm thinking of joining a graduate school for data science next fall, do you have any recommendation for that? Like what should i do for business specific data science. Again, thanks a lot for your videos
One of the best guy out there, helping beginners to boost through
Really like your content Ken ! watch your videos everyday.
I love your ideas. This is a great guide on how to start.
In Kaggle, I hope the projects are solved. I mean the codes are readily available to check, so going through the code snippets and understanding it makes the right strategy Ken? or should we choose a fresh project??
Your video seems so insightful and makes me feel so much better. I am just starting new PhD program in brain fmri analysis and am reading many articles in relation to machine learning algorithms. Do you think it would be worthy spending  much time on the mathematical derivative of algorithms, or rather like you said trying to know the use and some constraints of those ? I am puzzled about this question since the derivations are too complex to understand sometimes.
Omg he speaks so dam bored
FyI I think the idea of kaggle itself has grown pointless when teams with big compute capacity and pretty much educational institutions have thrown the completion out of skew..
Thank you so much! I cannot believe I didn't realize how helpful Kaggle is
Thank you so much! :)
Wait so if you want to get into data analysis of sports (or anywhere) you have to do computer science? Or you just need to know how to use Python/R to code for all the data entries?
Can these projects be done in R? Or is python recommended?
Good luck with your channel.
I'm trying to learn data science by myself and Ive been told I'm a quick learner but then I know that I lose interest or motivation even more quickly and have been at this for quite some time without much progress.
I think I should go with the projects and learn alongside, hope it works.
Mind-blowing the way to learn data science that  u have given.  Thanks a lot üòä more video  that ll be helpful for us
Ken, been watching your videos for a few weeks. Really enjoyed the content you put out here. 

As someone who has gone through the whole switching from non-tech major to data scientist/data analyst, where is the best platform to learn all the basic beside Kaggle? Would Dataquest/Datacamp be a good source?

You mentioned project-based learning is the best way to learn data science, besides looking at the project you mentioned above, anywhere else I can start getting my hands dirty?
I must add that your teaching Algorithm is 95% accurate..... I would have written 100% but that will make your model ( your teaching )  over fit...you know what I mean...
I really like the way you open up this learning techniques, I'm new in this field and please would you be my mentor?
I work in refugee protection and I am trying to gain skills in this field to apply it to predicting refugee status determination or other general human geography issues such as modeling human  movements internally  within countries based on unrest or disaster (IDPs) or cross-border movement.

The  UNHCR has datasets available publicly in the form of csv files.  How can I start to work with these in a Jupyter notebook? Does this need to be done from the terminal on Mac or can I do it inside Kaggle. I'm very new  to all of this and just want to play around with this data relevant to my field.
You're the man, not only highlighting great courses to use and the general way to go about growing in the field but also the words of encouragement for a newbie like me have been extremely helpful. Thank you!!!
Dude looks like a better looking Elon Musk.
Can i start doing the project without completing any of the micro courses on kaggle? or should i start wth the micro courses first before start doing the beginner's project?
"Experiential learning is the best way to learn and go through Data Science", very truly said because that helps us to evaluate where we lack and hence one is able to extend their domain of knowledge. Time to put the pedal to the metal!
Thank you for your suggestions. I've done the Titanic project guided by the step by step instructions. I am not familiar with the Python libraries. I'm not clear on what it all meant.

Now I am working through the ML mini course. I might go back to the Python course to refresh my memory about the basics. Then I'll try the Home Prices regression. 

Question: When you say 'google' the algorithm, do you mean to search for a conceptual understanding of what the algorithms do?
This man is the chad of the data science community.
Hi, Ken. Can you make a vlog about your hardware setup? Great content, btw. Keep it up!
Ken, so much clarified in such a short video. 
Thank you.
First of all thank you very much for the amazing videos to help and motivate us beginners.

Now I have 2 questions that might sound stupid lol.

1. I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using 2 other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting, would you consider that  normal when starting or is it bad ?(I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course)

2. For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that ?

Again thanks!
I am a beginner. I have just finished a degree in Mathematics (with a focus in analysis and statistics). I'm using HackerRank to develop my python skills, I use kaggle for datasets (I perform statistical learning techniques using R) and I am using Elements of Statistical Learning to learn the mathematics (this is important to me as a mathematician) and the algorithms needed in "data-science" through the exercises in the textbook. I have been thinking recently that I would like to get a textbook on the probability used in statistics, such as a textbook in probability theory (and random processes), is this something you would recommend? Also, are there any "machine learning" or other textbooks in statistics you would recommend? Many thanks.
Hi Ken, I've been watching your videos and really have enjoyed them. I am currently doing an internship in a startup that's developing insect farms  (insects for human consumption, mostly crickets). I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering, started my internship in more of a production stand point, but due to the pandemic I've redefined the project for a data driven improvement. In the last couple of months I've helped the company with its data collection and aggregation methodologies and tools. That has led me to be really interested in deepening my knowledge into data science. I'm currently working on the Coursera Data Specialization Courses and will be applying the tips that you've shared in your channel. Keep the good work. Pura Vida!
I am a beginner in data science and would love to do a project based on astronomy. Do you have any suggestions?
3:00
ken , want videos about intersection between sports analytics and data science. I really want to explore that side first, i am now training  my basics.
currently learning data analytics on Udemy, but most of the data used are already sources, I just have to import them into SQL or excel or Power BI; I opened Kaggle for the first time yesterday and I was lost. Didn't know where to start from or what to do
Hello, I have just completed learning concepts and algorithms of ML and deep learning. But after this, I really find no way to step forward, although I tried picking up some projects from kaggel, but in that too I faced a lot of problems and felt like a end. 

So can there be a specific journey defined for a learner to enter implementation phase after completing the learning phase?
Such an amazing channel and great content. Thank you for sharing!
omg i just realise when i took my machine learning course in school, the titanic dataset was used
Hey I wanna become a data analyst. Can I do these projects too or should I try out a different set of projects
I wonder how much speaking the word "algorithm" helps out with the algorithm
Any tips on how do you put or phrase these self-initiated/learned projects into resumes? Since it is hard to show their impact.
Hi Ken, 

What techniques should I use to create scores for data. So for example given a hotel and points of interest around the hotel, create a score for each hotel on its night life activity
hi sir, i want to step in this world of data. But i don't know where to start from. can you help me out please?
Is a week enough for normal people to complete one project ? :D
As a self learner, I'd say your vids are really helpful. First off, there's something calming about your voice. Secondly, the way you guide regarding the projects, helps me set a clear path  rather than rush into things and panick. Keep up the God's work your are doing. Thanks!
Thanks for your content!
Theres another site called AIcrowd which is pretty good as well
Hi Ken,  I have started learning data science and this video was very useful. I completed a course on basics of python for data science on udemy. Can i attempt any of the projects that you mentioned? Or do i need to learn any other skills?
One of the best channel on YouTube for data science . Lots of love man üòò .ur approach is very practical.
Thank you! This video is really useful.
I thumbed up and watched the video all the way through, why? because you also listed the things out in the description. Most people want to clickbait you into watching the full video so they dont list the content in the description, usually we have to go to the comments for someone to list them up. So thank you its appreciated.
thank you

Hi Ken, I binged thru your videos. I'm very new to this world although I've been in analytics for 7 years. I want to give the next step.

I just finished a basic python presential course and I'm currently enrolled in a presential course to get a basic data science diploma. a

I have no programming foundations so I'm doing basic programing course videos in YouTube, trying to get the best foundations thru free and low cost courses since  I can't afford going to college at this moment.

Is there any basic statistics course you would recommend to give me more idea about the analytics?

I appreciate that you share your experience with us!üôÇ
You made my day Sir ! Your video is quite informative and interesting. I would ask you what would you recommend for a freshman economics student to do right now to be a competent data scientist. (I am almost done with all the basic things in R so far.)
Geez this is really good
Love your channel man!  I'm gonna try these out!
Great advice, Thank you very much, Ken.
So I did small examples while learning this material during my MBA, but didn't have the time to delve deeper into projects. What sort of data science projects would you recommend for an MBA to learn?
Hi! Good video. Would you argue you need a strong programming background to become good at this? I have a MBA with a lot of statistics and planning to change paths to Data science. I do have some experience with Python. Would this be a good base change careers?
your videos are very helpful!
Great video! Would you recommend to have some of these project on a resume for applying internship position not so much in the data field, but more of a business position that required some levels of data analysis capabilities? e.g Market analyst, business analyst, project manager and such.
Thanks for your effort man!
Hey Ken. Thanks for sharing this video, amazing content. Do you recommend Dataquest DS courses? I am thinking of applying to its annual subscription, since they offer different types of practical projects.
I loved your contents, I have even sent u a connection request on LinkedIn. Could you suggest better ways to learn R and BI free of cost?
I recently started learning data science and started on this kaggle project of House hold prices. I was trying to establish relationship between the time at which houses are sold to the sale price of houses
Can you please explain how natural simulations like over at Jabrils, Primer etc. channels are made?? Thanks!
I have one question is that to practice project on Kaggle (house price for instance), if I look on others' work I worry that my own project will be a copy of them cuz I am a beginner, what should I do? Thanks in advance!
Thanks Ken for making this video. üòä
I had read and replied to your comment on the vlogger The Come Up video just now. Now looking at your channel, this video grabbed my attention. 

I am a coding beginner and I want to become a Data Engineer. And I am a USAF Veteran now age 35 BSc Accounting and Finance International (Black American) student at a UK University. And I feel my skills and strengths fit the Data Engineer career. 

Thank you for this insightful video. And I have subscribed to your channel.
I too have recently started to learn the basics of data science and honest;y kaggle is one of my favorite sites to find interesting datasets to work with. I took bio as my major in high school and had dropped maths in my last year so the concepts of statistics and probability and linear algebra got me scared at first but after I spent hours completing courses in those subjects (tons of pdfs and youtube channels and online courses) I feel pretty confident in my effort and knowledge. And I cant wait to dig deeper in this fascinating field of data science!
Hey Ken, hope you are doing good. Thanks for all the videos. Enjoying it thoroughly. In learning with case studies how do I know which algorithm I should choose? 










Also, can you upload a project that starts with data collection, which has a lot of missing values in it, where more time is spent on data cleaning and pre-processing as I heard from many DataScientist that they spend the majority of their time in Data preprocessing?
A data scientist from my firm told me JavaScript will be very useful to learn as a data scientist. How does that come into play
your videos really help alot
Awesome video for beginners!!! thanks for your insight! do you have videos on steps of data exploration and preparation as well?
MOre
Thank you for the video! It‚Äôs always so useful to actually see some real projects that people work on. You got my thumb up
Thanks for making this video! Would you think this is a good project that I could do with Python data libraries? Analyzing why ticket sales are very high for a specific horror film compared to the US?
Are good programming skills required to become a data scientist? Are data scientists software engineers or  rather mathematical model builders?
Through watching your video, I realized that my school DS project, which was to compare error rates of different classification algorithms, won't count as much as the topics you mentioned... I should really work more on new projects. As a recent undergraduate, I want to start with Titanic classification project. And House price regression project sounds fun too! Thanks for the recommendations!
Hey Ken, enjoyed some of your videos. Really enjoy data science have a pretty good background as an IE major. Looking to improve my skills. One concern I have. I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal? Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc?? Would really appreciate. Thanks
Hello Ken, 


thanks for the videos. Ive learned a lot from you. 
Can you please make a video about Application for a Job as a Data Scientist (CV and how to structure my Github in case the company wanna have a look on it). It would be so helpful because Im quit good in Python  but still didn't found a job.
Thank you again !
4 Main Project Topics

1. Regression
2. Classification 
3. Clustering
4. Deep Learning
the frustration is real. thanks for the encouragement, most times I feel like tossing my computer into the wall. i don't though....too expensive
Titanic is very good project for EDA
Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.
Hello Ken.
I need to contact you personally.
Would a major in data science paired with a minor in finance and statistics be smart??
Having a bachelor in maths what would be my next move in order to become a data scientist  would you recommend me trying a master in data science
Dis you just say data science jobs are hard to get,  I'm starting a masters program in data science this fall, it's full time and on campus, plus I have a major in healthcare. I see a lot of job openings daily on linked in, and I hear, it's hard to find really qualified people, do you think it's still gonna be hard to get a job ?
Hey Ken!
What I have to choose in between Bachelor of business administration major in Finance or IT..to continue in data Science?!
What are you thoughts about bsc courses in data science at top universities?
physics...? really? interesting
Would marketing also be a good undergrad study prior to a master? As you could have the marketing skills, and match it with Data Analytics/Science for a company
Im doing currently bachlors in statistics i discovered this field few months ago i fell in love with the data science, im planning to do masters in statistics and building foundation for data science and programming
I'm a Business Student who is just starting off his journey to become a  Sports Analyst (because I love football) Thank You so much for this amazing video Ken! It's really very helpful! ‚úåÔ∏è
I wanna to know details about data scientist .. please help me
Thanks for this! Learning data science as a college student is really hard but I am hoping that I could use data science for our capstone project in the next semester
is economics major for undergrad okay and what should i do along with it?
Hello Ken Jee,  is it possible for one to have a data science job without a degree in Data Science. If it is possible, how likely is it.
Ken are you really data scientist ?? ü§î Plz tell me I want to ask you very questions ??
#66 + 4: Not too many personal details here, but I will share this video with someone that is becoming a College Student, I do like how you motivate your findings on what is useful to do. I would love to go back to my College life and had this advice.
The story about your first video (Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU) is funny, I'm glad that makes you a DS YouTuber!!
#66daysofdata
Thanks for your video, sir! I'm now a freshman at university, when it's time to choose major. Do you recommend me to choose pure computer science or data science. I am confused because the major of data science is set in the school of bussiness at my university. There are many bussiness course to learn (almost the same amount as computer science). And there are not courses of the underlying knowledge about computer science (like computer network) Could you please give me some advice? Your words will be greatly appreciated!
I'm currently doing an undergrad in data science and engineering (in India), which I picked up impulsively. If that was a bad decision, would it be better for me to do a master's in computer science (hopefully from the US or Canada) to break into the data science?
I noticed you talked about how a data science major is more watered down than a DS masters, and how majoring in one area of DS could be better. 
I‚Äôm currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school?

Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis.

Thanks,
Siyoung Kim
Thanks for the video sir. Im currently working on my masters degree in Statistics/Data science. Do you think it is likely I could get a job as a data scientist when I graduate? Or is it more likely i will need to start off as an analyst or something similar? Thanks again!
What I have liked about Ken is he is trying to reach out to everybody by answering almost every question asked in the comment section. I love that bro.
this channel is extremely underrated!
hey Ken! thank you for this video it's super helpful.
I'm an undergrad and am still exploring what I want to do.¬†
I found data science interesting, I just have a quick question: are strong math skills helpful in DS?
I'm doing Btech in Data Science and Engineering. Is it a right pathway to get a data science job?
I‚Äôm a senior in high school and am planning to major is data science in college. Is this a bad idea? Do jobs not want people with a data science major? I hope you see this and respond üôèüèº
Hi Ken. First off, thanks for all the quality content you put out. I have a question after watching this and your boot camp vs certificate video.
I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option. I already have some programming history with a technology diploma and wouldn't mind the bootcamp. Thanks
Hey Ken!
Thanks for the video, what about Computer Information Systems?
Thank you
Hey there!!
Thanks for such a great content!!!
But I still have a few questions;
If I have opportunity to choose between Data Science and Computer science major then which one will be better?
(Even for ML Engineer jobs )

And do you like to advice me on working destinations for data scientist employees among: Z√ºrich, US, Australia
Super helpful
Awesome channel! I am a rising Junior majoring in Data Science with a concentration in AI. I have always felt lucky that my school actually offers a Data Science undergrad program. But I also feel like school does not provide as much practical experience or project-based learning as internships do. However, getting an DS internship as someone who has only been in university for only two years is very difficult as well. They don't think you have the skills or enough practice (which is kinda true). Just a big vicious cycle.
Is micromasters by edx (after undergraduaition)enough to get a internship or a entry level job( also including some kaggle projects)
How much of CS do you actually need? I was planning to do a Math-Physics-Stats combo. Is it important to have a formal degree to progress forward? Because I was planning to do the entire coding part on my own without taking on site classes for that
Hey, @Ken Jee,
I have a question 
Are Big Data, Spark, Hive... etc used by Data Scientist
I already know programming in python. And am interested in data science. Can u suggest what to do next? Like do I need to learn about machine learning and deep learning and neural networks in that order or if not then which order is more preferable?
I love it how you mention everything in the description of the video too. Loving your channel.
Any intro stats online courses for total beginners?
can we do a data science project on anime
I am studying physics as an undergrad and my growing interest in this field saw its peak when I found out that my university had offered free Coursera access. I am currently taking data science related math, statistics, and Python courses there. I aspire to specialize in machine learning since I feel drawn to certain aspects of it. I have just found out about your channel thanks to your interview with Tim Bowling and hit the subscribe button. I find your videos really helpful. Keep up the great work!
A starting point for aspiring data scientists graduating from undergraduate degrees in data science is seeking out a role as a data analyst, data engineer, business analyst, or business intelligence analyst. There are significantly more openings for these roles than strictly as a data scientist. Plus build a website to showcase particular skills through a portfolio of representative projects.
Hey, Love your content but it seems a little country specific, I am guessing USA.
I just had some doubts,
Is it necessary to have a degree like you have in computer science ?
What if our college professors do not have adequate knowledge and reach regarding this field ?
We have Calculus in our class 11th and 12th and i have no problems grasping maths concept, although i am not acquainted with physics at all. I was planning to learn Python, Excel and Statistics. Now that you have mentioned Calculus as well, i would be revising that too.
I just wanted to know if i am taking the right steps ?  I am 17 so i have not joined any University yet, but have been taking courses on the above mentioned topics
can i do mba and then learn data science
Which language is best for data science : R or PYTHON?
Do you consider Computer vision as a part of Data science?
why physics as second choice? abvoe math and statistics? what does physics have to do with ds?
Hi! I have few questions
-Is it better to  start my masters degree right after undergraduate?
- Any advices for an international student who wants to do masters in USA & Would it be possible to find job opportunities ?
Thanks for the video, I‚Äôm double-majoring in finance and computer science. At first I was so lost I didn‚Äôt know where or how to get help with internship. I ended up getting an internship at a well known fintech company. I learned a lot.
Ridiculous mic. Completely useless.
Is it possible to get an internship after your first year or should I save my efforts and wait for my second year?
Wow just found this channel, amazing. Thanks.
Those lists on your wall are really working! See you in the Data Science world!
Hey Ken, I am majoring in B.S. Information Sciences and a possible minor in computer science. I also plan on getting a masters in Data Science. Can I get data science internships with this major? Is this a good pathway to get a data science major? I
I think I may have just discovered the most useful YouTube channel ever.
Hey Jee! Can you suggest me as a beginner  what should I first start basic stats or learn prog Lang?
Hi Ken, opinion on Government Data science jobs?
Thanks so much for putting this content out. Currently a Data Analytics undergrad student (after having done a Data Analytics bootcamp lol) this video has been an invaluable resource. I have a question regarding your second point of going back to grad school/not wanting to go back to school and still wanting to work in data science. Why do you consider Physics to be an integral part of learning in the field? I can see why one should study 'CS, Math, Statistics, or some other quantitative discipline', but hadn't thought of Physics and how it fits in the data science landscape. Interested in your thoughts. Thanks for your time!
This was really useful. I‚Äôm currently dual majoring in mathematics and computer science with a minor in actuarial science. Would it be useful to go for a PhD in statistics, or is that overkill for data science?
Ken, I know i'm going a little off topic but  still... What's your opinion on the new MacBook 13" as a main computer for a CS data science-oriented undergrad?
Great video man! Where did you go to grad school?
Hey ken if i do my bachelors in computer applications or economics can i become a data scientist and which one is gonna help me more??
Also is it important to get a data science degree or diploma
Hii i am an undergraduate, i recently did a course from Coursera about data analysis
I did it with the help of MATLAB Software
The course name was data analysis with MATLAB, to continue my data science learning what should i do next?
I am majoring in Accounting and minoring in Data Science, what do you think about this path?.
Hey, I'm pursuing a commerce or more specifically a finance degree but I'm thinking of going into the data science field. So is it like a feasible decision? Will my degree even matter?  
Thanks!
ty
Hi Ken. Super helpful video! One thing that worried me was your second point as I am a 3rd data science major at UCSD and I am not looking to go back to grad school. I also don't have that much under my portfolio or much experience but I am currently working on personal projects on the side and applying to internships. I was wondering if you were in this situation, would there be any additional steps that you would take?
Just got my master's degree in business analytics and your videos inspired me a lot! I hope I can watch your video before I applied for this program. My program was a two-year program covered R, tableau, JMP, Excel, supply chain and SQL. But I have not landed a job yet. To finish my program as soon as I can, I took summer sessions and didn't find an intern. After graduation, Some people say students with CS background is stronger and suggest me to start to learn python or java. Some say SAS certificates would help me get a job easily. What's your opinion about my situation?  Thank you Ken.
No doubt about communicating with professors to get an experience. I was able to get a machine learning research position as an undergrad at one of my CS professors' lab. 
Also, other pieces of advice are priceless! Thank you Ken!
Awesome video! This really helped as I am a undergrad physics/data science major :) I requested to connect w you on linkedin too!
Thank you for this video! I have a nice video suggestion.
How to implement Data Science into a working business?
Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators. One single small factory, a sales team, etc.
I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient, let it be the energy consumption, the production itself, supply chain, sales, marketing, etc.
What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient? What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.
Thanks a lot! I am your devoted fan. There are many channels out there but they don't cover Data Science as broadly as you are. You deserve many more views! I believe you will get them!
I am curious as to your opinion on these 3 month bootcamps that claim to have a job guarantee and claim that people get data science roles versus an 18-24 month masters program. I find it hard to believe a 3 month bootcamp would outweigh a two year program.
one thing which makes me really enjoy your content is how each video gets straight to the point, and that its summarised in the description. Thanks Ken Jee! :)
Thank you Ken, I am now a business student in UK, inspired by your twitter scraper video, I decide to apply business analysis for master degree.
Hi Ken, I want to pursue career in Data Science and I'm struggling with it. Though I'm in final year of undergraduate degree in computer science  but I haven't worked on real projects. I really have this passion and feel that I can do work but Argh ! I find myself stuck every single time.  Despite the fact that people appreciate me for 'Learning new things without hesitation' but I do not progress. I have been using online free resources about data analysis, machine learning for about two months but I couldn't progress from regression and classification. When I learn I deeply grasp a concept... and I've discussed this thing with my professor many times but I didn't get satisfactory answer. Am I missing something , doing wrong ? Or is it just I worry too much ?
How many pages should the resume be
Impressive video. Thanks!
Great tips! thank you!
Thanks a lot again, ken. I'll be sure to avoid these mistakes. For now, I'll just post the beginner projects that I have. Will update the resume as and when I do better ones.
Great advice, thanks for that video. Does, based on your experience, CV formatting plays a role? I saw a couple of CVs for people who work some years now as Data Scientists/Engineers and their CVs had almost identical formats, i.e., visual-based CVs. Are those better for passing the Application Tracking Systems?
Is it okay if I include other projects that aren't related to Data Science, like IOT based projects or software engineering projects ?
thanks for the very helpful and useful tips :)
Day 9 of #66DaysofData: Note to self to come back to this as one of the first steps to transform from passive to aggressive/active jobseeking and use this as a checklist after modifying resume!
Gr8 content .....!
can you review my resume
#66 + 3: Certainly, I will get back to this when I'm in a full mode of searching for a job, there are great tips, the idea of having one Master resume .. super smart Ken! 
Thank you!
#66daysofdata
3:16,3:52
Great tips Ken. I always tell my friends, if you have any interesting hobby, don't be afraid to put it in your resume. If you are a black belt in karate, it better be on there! It enables you to stand out and fix mistake #6 on your list and "have personality in your resume". I also created a video where I walk students step by step to create their resume, feel free to check it out on my channel.
Hi Ken, can you help me with a data science resume for a software developer with 5 yrs experience.
Thank you very much, Sir. This really helped to get me my first internship
Hi Ken, I was hoping to get your advice on something. Well I'm currently getting my Masters in Engineering Management with a Specilization in Analytics. I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management. This program basically teaches me both skills. However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am. I still believe once I am done with the program, I'll have the same skillset as the other majors, I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed.
Really helpful insights Ken
Thanks Ken.  I really like the idea of tip 3, on focusing on the outcome not the algorithms.  I'm guilty of spending all my energy on trying to show off a complex algorithm rather than why I'm doing the project in the first place....i.e. what will it help answer/solve and then how to convey that answer.  I'm going to go back and update a few recent projects.
Hi ken, I have only one internship related to Data science, but I also worked in a Newsagent, a hostel, and I taught English as a voluntary project. Do you think I should mention them as well ? Or just compensate my lack of experience with more projects and mention that one internship ? Thank you for your time. I really respect you for answering most if not all of the comments on your videos.
well you are doing machine learning so somewhat implies you are working with a robot xD
Ken Jee-nius
Your channel has been popping in my feed this last week. Great content Ken, it inspires me to keep pursuing a career in DS (I'm a statistician).
Solid advice my man!
Hey Ken, I have become a recent follower of yours. Thanks for all the info you have been giving on DS, trying to keep all of that in mind while working. 
I have recently done some basic DS projects on Kaggle and I don't think the end result I have gotten out of them are good enough, so should I upload them on github inspite of the not-so-good results or should I first focus on improving them and then upload it?

Thanks in advance!
I can't give you a like even though I want to... (It's at 69 likes)
I'm migrating from a software career to data science. I have a few data science projects in my portfolio. But still at least a 90% of my projects are pure technical software projects. Is it a good idea to list these in my portfolio. Because if not, I'll be presenting a resume with 5 years of software expeirience with no actual portfolio for that part of my life. Does it do any good. Or bad. Can you give your thoughts.?
Hello Ken,
which kind of project do I need to include in my Github Portfolio ?
Thanks
Thanks Ken! 


Definitely a very underrated channel. Very informative and insightful!
Are these applied to data science internships as well?
Great advice, Thanks Ken!
Thanks Ken.. will update my resume
Thanks Ken!!!
Excellent!
This is really great way to explained !!!Thank you.
My favorite part is ‚Äúplating=data viz‚Äù
Thank you  so much ken... For giving the  right idea about  how data science works....
@Ken! This video tells me that you really REALLY like cooking =) Who would go through this for a data science video without love for food and cooking?! Great analogies! I want to add one more to your analogies if I may... Good quality food = Good quality data. Often times neglected, but makes the most impact =) Also, here is a riddle for all foodies and people who loves to cook. I came up with this after many years of cooking and baking. Here it is: What is in every recipe that you doesn't have a taste? The answer also makes sense from the data science perspective =)
#66 + 2: This is great Ken, now on I will never forget the steps with the cooking analogy :)
It's really funny how you talk about the cooking tools; when it's the moment I literally will draw a picture of an oven, stove, etc to remember each method ü•ò
As always, thank you!
#66daysofdata
give you a taste of what data science is like ok i like the analogies lol
Hi Ken
my guy, you are surely underrated. thanks, I can finally wrap my head around what data science is
very nice
Great and yummy analogy to tell a story. Subscribed immediately. Thx for all ur time and efforts
great analogy! I love food, so this is perfect and relatable
One more common thing here guys.... We try to build a project by different methods or by different algorithms and in the same way we try to make a dish by using different methods....
Hey Ken this is interesting... I also cook sometimes but never tried to relate this with data science but you have explained it very well..... I will definitely try this....I hope this will also improve my cooking üòÅ
Amazing analogy! I'll definitely borrow this when I need to explain what data science is
Muchas gracias,  este video esta muy bien explicado, +1 suscrito
That was truly creative. The analogy was simple to follow and relate to. Thanks for sharing!
I am a great cook. Can I clear Data science interviews ??? :))
Excellent Ken, reminds me a lot of my own style while teaching tech concepts to non-techies
Love the analogy, Ken - everyone can relate to it. Will give it a try.
underrated channel
Love it
Hey Ken, im from Brazil, and I im doing a udacity program for data analyst.
What path do you recommend for me to become a data scientist (since step1) 
And if you have time, (i cant find anywhere ) make a v√≠deo doing a model, basically what a data scientist does, but actually doing it.
Thanks for the content, you are really good keep going
unexpected but interesting comparison! i definitely agree with you on the feature engineering portion
Great analogy Ken!!
Thanks, Ken!  I have been a math teacher for 27 years.  Getting a Masters in Applied Stats looking to get into Sports Analysis.   These videos are giving me a great direction on how to proceed.  I appreciate it.  Question...most of my courses are focusing on using R or SAS, is the industry more R or Python-focused? Or does it matter...maybe just a good idea to have good knowledge of both?  Thanks.
Terrific video. Very helpful. Thanks.
Hey guys. I recently got my seriousness in life and have decided to get into data analytics. There is no way im working for a boring ass company and hence i wanted to get into a career i like (Something related to sports) SO anyone with the same ideas msg me or comment and we'll get in touch. Networking is a must right.
As a curious outsider just getting started I found your overall point very helpful advice, looking for a goal to reach / accomplish with a project and working backwards from there. A nice overview of projects, thank you.
what about analytics in Esports?
Out of curiosity, do you do any sports gambling?  I'd imagine having experience in sports analytics would give you a competitive edge.
Thanks a lot for the great video! Very interesting insights and ideas! What I am just wondering about is how to get the data for something like player or team valuation or also understanding the game? If I am thinking about German Bundesliga (soccer) I would not know where to start getting this data for free. I read that there are some data providers where you can buy data from but for a private project I would prefer to get some data for free :-D Would this in the end mean, that one has to collect this data on its own?
Is it possible to become a remote sports analyst without a degree?
Hey there,
I am a Physical Therapy undergraduate student from India and want to get into sports performance analytics.
Do you recommend this switch...what would be your suggestion on the same
#66 + 1: Here I go again .... 
And right timing, as always. 
I started a little project with some results from a sport that are showing me insights, and certainly, the playing numbers article will help me to understand the idea forward from what I'm thinking :)
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
#66daysofdata
Correct me if I am wrong but, If we observe analytics was also there in the past like coaches or players used to study themselves like improvement area, where to focus and similar attributes which we use these days but due to modern tools and algorithms it is more organized and accurate.
Hi Ken , 
I am Nitish working as a tableau developer having an experience of 3 years as a professional. I worked mainly on Healthcare and Pharma based projects.
From my childhood I was very fascinated about sports analytics.
Can you guide me from now how can I use my  skills into getting a job related to sports analytics work in best companies
Hi kan 
Great video.
One question, do you know where I can get sports data to analyze?
Great vid man great vid
I‚Äôm a recent college graduate with my CIS degree and I think I want to go into sport analytics. But I‚Äôm no longer in college how where do I start? I can‚Äôt get internships and they won‚Äôt hire me without experience
I'm a college sophomore looking to do a research project this summer relating to sport analytics. This channel has already helped me get started and I can't wait to see where I can go from here! Going to need to do a LOT more research and learning about the raw math but also the programs. Thanks for sharing all this content!
Hi Ken,

I am currently getting my masters in data science. However, I have extensive experience as a soccer coach and exercise science/rehab science. I would like to combine my passions for sport and biomechanics with DS. 

Is this a realistic goal? Any recommendations?
If you want to get to the projects straight away go to 5:02 but you should listen to what he‚Äôs got to say
@ Ken Jee 
Good day 
I'am looking for a homebased sports analytics job can you recommend some...

I'm looking forward for the course related to sports analytics
hi ken i have been working as a sports analyst from last 1 one year for a company called HUDL its headquarter is in nebraska. working for that company i have done analysis for many high-school teams across USA in American Football ,also done NbA ANALYSIS nd done different project regarding soccer like player tracking,event tagging,also i knw about lacrosse analysis. i want to pursue my career in this field nd my main interest is in american football  or the NFL and NBA, i really think i can do wonder in NFL AND NBA like projects. please help me out with that.
Hi Ken wanted to ask you about how can you use analytics for soccer as data there is more unorganised like how to identify the patterns of play various formations used during the match using analytics and by the way  love you videos
Hi Ken don't you think Data Scientists are limited to the quality extent of the Dataset they have access to?
Hi Ken, do you recommend that data scientists should learn how to webscrape (like using Beautifulsoup)? I know pandas has a read_html function that lets you extract lists from websites so I was contemplating on learning beautifulsoup.
Are sports analytics projects ok as personal projects when applying to a different industry? I really like it but I'm not sure if it will be looked down upon. Love your vids
as a newcomer to golf during the pandemic I'm absolutely hooked by the sport and find your content a gem :) hopefully more and more golf equipment manufacturers will incorporate ML/AI into the process of making the clubs which also present itself as a great marketing opportunity such as what Callaway is already doing. I'm hopeful that the future of the golf simulation market relys on visual based ML/AI and will drive the costs down for the barrier of entry so that more ppl can enjoy golfing at home!
#66: Last video of this round, and was about Golf. I think is a coincidence ü§ì
Ken, thank you for the #66daysofdata challenge, really helped me to evaluate & organize my time, I feel a little bit more confident of my knowledge in DS, now I have more ideas on how to move forward in my projects, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have access to new courses (Udemy & NVIDIA).
I will keep moving forward, and because this initiative has helped that much I will start Round 3 right away, videos will be on this one too but I will be more focused on projects, I will share them for sure!!

The simulation is really cool. It was one year ago so there are more advance and cooler versions of the golf simulator.
Another awesome video, Ken!  Golf has been a big part of my life and now I‚Äôm in a data science bootcamp so this video was very interesting. Thanks for the perspective!
you should start a data science discord server
This is very interesting Ken!
Hey Everyone - Thanks for watching the video! If you have any questions, please leave them below. I also can't stress enough how important projects are for learning data science. I highly recommend watching the other videos that I have pinned at the end of this one to learn more about them!

Play video at 1.25x, thank me later
Did he say he got 2 master degrees? what was the first one? the second one was comp sci...
#65: The dog ... okeyyyy üê∂
So statistics, yeap think mathematically is important on DS. 
I get stuck sometimes thinking which is the best way to play with the features. Really STUCK! (Any advice on this?)
It's nice to hear your story, and how the experience vs. interest give you a nice path to DS and ML, and how you share what you learn in this videos. Thank you! :)

Hi Ken
Hii Sir,
I am from Electrical Engineering background and I want to opt  ""Data Computational Science"" for my masters (M-tec). Will it be a good transition ?
Always watching this charming man without speeding up. Totally intrigued.
Thank you for your video! Very encouraging to start learning ! What do you think about Coursera courses? I am taking python for AI from IBM now to build my python skills
The really basics are: Python, SQL, calculus and stathistics?
Hey Keen, i trying to build a better basics in fundamental mathematics: logic, sets, functions. I already have a background in calculus and stathistics, because I was in enginnering.
I want to enter in data science because I love calculus and stathistics.
Which one do you prefer in case of self learning or learning from someone else?
Can you please make a video or share little bit about how do you used the data science for your golf game?
Yes this true path is different for everyone and in my case you are helping me to build my path very well....üòÄ
Thank you for sharing all of this! We've had some pretty similar experiences up to about the consulting part, which I started in this fall. Definitely going to check out more of your videos!!

Hey I'm interested in data analysis/science too. Could you recommend any good books about data analysis in sports? I watched a movie "Moneyball" and it would be good to find out whether doing analysis in sports is useful. I'm a  huge fan of basketball (NBA). So if you could give any suggestions, I would appreciate it a lot.
Heck yeah, this was awesome!  Thanks for sharing your journey, Ken!
Hello sir, 
I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science. I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing, parallel computing, algorithm engineering, mathematics models for optimization problems. I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml.
I'm 27 with a bocherlo's degree in finance and 4 years of experience in the retail bank sector (corporate credit risk analyst to be more precise). I've always been very curious about programming and data science, I even learned some basic coding back in HS. What are the odds for me to switch career to data science/analysis if I complete a 10 month specialization?
Do you use your skills for the other side of sports analytics? On the bet side?
Hi sir what can you recommend and prefer ? I'm planning on taking Masters in Information Technology with especialized in Data Analytics or should I go for Masters in Business Analytics.. I'm currently working as Software testing engineer both Manual and Automation. Thanks for your feedback.
Hello Mr. Ken. Keep going brother. My well wished will always be with you. I hope one day I will be successful  just like youüòÄ.
Hey Ken do you have an email to reach out for more help?  Im new to data science but im having issues importing panda on spyder Error: (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'panda')  I uninstalled all python programs because I thought it couldnt find the panda location but its still giving me the same error.I tried going on reddit but couldnt find a fix hopefully someone here can help thank you!

 ''''import csv
'''


import panda as pd


data = pd.read_csv('plant_2.csv')
Love your videos!
Good initiative Ken. I can't wait to start
Thanks for your videos, they def help a lot of ppl including me
Do I need a degree to become a data analyst/ scientist?
Hey Ken I just wanted to say thank you for creating this channel and the content on it...I always had an interest in Data Science but felt like it had such a high barrier to entry for me I never really thought much of doing it..After graduating with my Bachelors in CS last year however I'll be entering grad school in a week for Data Science specifically with an intended goal to get into Sports Analytics for Baseball...and having only discovered your channel a week ago I've been binging a lot of your videos on Data Science and Sports Analytics and am really thankful for all the great information you provide in all of the videos!...I've been following quite a few CS/Software YouTube channels the past few years but always wished i could find a Data Science/Sports Analytics channel so stumbling upon your channel was awesome to have happen!
You guys i.e data science youtubers are severly underrated.
Hi Ken Jee, thank you so much for sharing your experience on data science. I'm a statistics student and I am interested in data science. I learned some R and C++ programming language in my uni but I'm not that good in programming. Upon graduating, I hesitate on whether to start working or further study in master program. If further study in master program, what course do you suggest? Data science, computer science or any other relevant course? 
Looking forward to get your valued opinions. Thank you. ^^
Awesome video Ken, really enjoyed learning from your experiences. I'm an engineering student looking into using consulting as a stepping stone into data science, but your video is giving me some second thoughts about the consulting piece. Are there some red flags about this plan that I'm not seeing? I've reached out on LinkedIn if you'd rather respond over PM. Thanks man!
Hi Ken.. I just found your channel as I have been searching abt Data Science a lot. I am currently working as a Corporate Banker in the field of Digital Banking, Fintechs. I have a Tech Bachelor degree and a MBA in Finance. I want to learn DS, AI and want to switch to such career.. How do I take it ahead.. Pls guide me
Im now a junior majoring in finance. Can I still become a data scientist if I get a masters in business analytics or data science?
Hello Ken, How should I'm into digital marketing and interested in web analytics. Can you suggest what will be the best path for me? I have recently completed a one data science with python project.
You are too slow üòÇ and good thing is you share quality content but sometimes i feel sleepy.
Please make changes in your story telling. May be this is the reason why you are not famous in ds but you deserve.
Man, all these just remind me myself, I tackled bunch of majors even filmmaking, then end up doing Economics. Now in my 25, I became data science freak. It's sad how those years were unproductive but I think everybody has a unique career and that brings us unique opportunities.
Interesting story!
Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content!  I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.  
My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?   
I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.  
Thanks again for the great content, I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge.
Hi Ken, I'm a Human kinetics graduates which involves a lot of sports. I decided to apply data science to sports but I dont know what path I need to follow in order to achieve this. Kindly suggest  and I'm a beginner I just started learning R
I‚Äôm curious, do you know what your Myers Briggs personality is? I‚Äôd love to see how that relates to your skills.
Hey Ken thanks for your videos. I am currently finishing up my Bachelors in CS and plan to get my MS in Data Analytics. I‚Äôve been learning Python on my own time and I‚Äôve build several text-based games. My question is, what should I learn after having a good grasp on Python to help me expand my knowledge in the Data Science field? What tools or frameworks should I use when building my Data Science portfolio projects?
Hi ken, I have a question, do you know if George Washington university‚Äôs certificate in data analytics is a good way to Start out in data science with someone with no background in data science?
Hey Ken! Please tell what's your nickname/name at Kaggle. Want to follow you
Great video, Ken! I also did two MS degrees, one in CS, and am currently working as a data scientist. One piece of advice I have for people who are considering graduate school but are worried about the cost is to look for schools that offer TA/RA opportunities. Depending on the school, these positions can fully cover tuition and pay an additional stipend for living expenses.
Great content in your videos. I‚Äôm trying to get into Data science and I started learning python. Let‚Äôs see how it goes. I appreciate your work on providing the info on Data Science.
I'm Mechanical Graduate, with 4 years of experience as Design Engineer in Automotive sector. I'm good with python and Tableau. At present I've one question how to get transition from Design Engineering background to Data Science background. When I'm applying for job related to data science, employer is asking about experience in the same field, I'm little stuck at this point. Please guide me in this regards.
Thanks for this video and I must confess, I can relate to your story as an upcoming data scientist.
awesome video

Hi daddy
Huh. I am so lost?!!
Carmen V√°zquez L√≥pez
there is no sales major?
Hey Ken, I'm currently a grad student studying econ and finance and am just starting to utilizing data science to research at a higher level. What would you suggest is a good path is to cover the core basics of data science? My current idea of a 'best path' is: SQL, R, Python, and then focusing on packages like tableau and Tensorflow. What are your thoughts/suggestions. Could also do a video on this ;) Thanks!
You did McIntyre? I did a couple electives there! Though the classes were a lot... softer than my main DS classes.
What do you recommend? 
MS in Computer Science or MS in Data Science /Business Analytics?
I also took statistics 3  times and became an econ major
Hey Ken - I've been following your channel for a couple weeks now and really appreciate the time you put into making these videos. I graduated college a couple years ago with a degree in journalism, and I find the integration of storytelling with data science very compelling. Compelling enough for me to consider going back to school to get another degree in computer science, as I would really like to combine the power of data science and journalism. 
Thanks so much and keep it up! 
Duncan - Montr√©al
Thank you so much for sharing this ken! Im really loving your videos.
I just found your channel and I'm planning on watching one of your videos every single day starting today. Great content -- thankful that it's useful and informative instead of mindlessly entertaining like so much of youtube.
Hi ..thanks for sharing this insight...m well settled and have a career in security industry but I want to learn about data analysis so that I can make sense of numbers and improve like u did with golf ....awaiting ur response..thanks
Hi Ken. I am making a career change and want to get a second degree in CS. I noticed some schools do not offer second degrees except at the graduate level. What were your other school choices for your MS degree? How did you research? Any good resources? Did you consider online program?
been struggling to get into DS on and off 2 years after i finished my masters in management science. am even embarrassed and maybe a bit frustrated with myself a bit but u have given me the morale to get back on it, been binge watching all your videos, your route seems pretty legit and straight forward..much gratitude man . will watch the ads just for u
You're videos are so informative!
I like it!
I like it!
This person has JEE in his name. That's why he is so hard-working... XDXD
Hey, I have just stumbled upon your channel as I was trying to find some good resources regarding data science. I am currently a third year student doing a computer scene degree with integraded masters. Next year, I have the option to choose some optional modules like: Machine learning technologies or foundations of data science. What do you think I should take? Should I take the ML course and try to understand data science in my free time? I can only take one of those 2. Sorry for the long comment. Your countent is great and I cant wait to see some more stuff from you!!
Great content! I am in final year of Computer Science undergrad. I am focusing on becoming a Data Scientist and your video on essential list of projects for resume gave me a clear idea of where I should be heading. Getting insights from a Data Scientist helps a lot in getting a clear sense of direction.
Hey Ken ..today I mark the first day of learning in Data science field. I'm a mechanical engineering graduate and have embryonic knowledge on statistics. I've enrolled myself in one MOOC program and plan to gradually enhance my leaning curve. Can you point on some pertinent points  I should keep in mind while I pursue my first phase of learning. 
Also want to thank you for your informative videos!
I should add a lesson: no matters your credentials,  your work,  your position, your company,  or your experience,  all makes code as they want so dont worry about doing code this way or that. Only focus on keep moving. Learning is forever.
Foun today your channel. Great content.
Nice video. I liked the part about being self-discipline in learning data science and building a portfolio. I going back to school to get my M.S. in business analytics while working full-time. Thankfully, my job helps cover some of the cost.
hey Ken Dodji here. Thanks for your approach of teaching DS. Do you think you can spend some time on how to manage files with github and the flow of working between git hub, shell commands, and the jupyter notebooks. Your series on working on data science projects from scratch is the best by the way. Thank you.
Yes. Story telling is under appreciated. It's not even really taught...
Hey Ken, great video. 
Went through your linkedin profile and found that you've done your masters from Depaul University.
I have been working as a Data Analyst for the past two years and was thinking of pursuing a graduate degree in the same university. Some questions.. 
1. How do you rate the Ms in CS with Machine learning electives as compared to the Ms in Data Science program at Depaul university?
2. And what course do you suggest if I plan on being a data scientist 3 years down the line?
So I‚Äôve been binge watching many of your videos, there‚Äôs not a lot of DS resources to begin with so first I wanna say thank u for putting stuff out there to help me. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre my mentor. 

I have questions: Should I get a MS before getting a job or while I‚Äôm working? I‚Äôm a recent math major graduate, was planning to go to med school but then I wanted to do something in my field (math) and I learned about data science and I instantly knew, I‚Äôm doing DataQuest data science path, Do i even need a MS? Can you do a review of DataQuest? 

How much should I study a day? I‚Äôve been studying 6-8 hours a day, after I finish my full time dead end job, just so I can get into a company I want and start being a data scientist. Rn I‚Äôm a beginner, just started in Feb, learned python, OOP, NumPy and Pandas and now I‚Äôm doing data aggregation and cleaning. Anyways, where can I practice? I feel like Kaggle is advanced for me and I feel like cheating if I don‚Äôt know how to do something and I look it up.
Damn, I switched majors a bunch of times too and decided to go wth economics because I felt like it was challenging enough to keep me focused. NOW I‚Äôm in my last semester and about to apply to a graduate program for data science to become a data scientist that will hopefully work in sports.
Hi Ken, great video. I recently finished my Master‚Äôs in Applied Analytics, but the Data Science learning journey is never over. I really appreciate your insight and perspective on the field of Data Science and Sports Analytics. Keep up the great work!
Dude, You're amazing. Whenever I sidetrack myself from learning Data Science. Your videos really help me there in keeping me interested and intact to proceed to learn more about it. 
Love your content.
Thank you so much for mapping out your path. I am curious to know what your thoughts are regarding health informatics and how feasible it would be for an informatics specialist to transition into data science?
Why you r not popular? Underrated
hello Ken
1. I‚Äôm going to college and I‚Äôm considering to major in sports analytics, sports business, or sport studies and I wanna know what‚Äôs the best 
2. I know a bit about sports like basketball and football and combat sports but when it comes to things like baseball i don‚Äôt know how it works my question is do I need to know everything about all these sports to get this job or study a major like this or how does it work, what do I need to know abt sports or do I even need to know?
Really spot on prediction on how prevalent sports books would become.  I‚Äôm absolutely bombarded by their ads daily.
I think I want to do something in either the moneyball field (helping teams) or DFS (predicting outcomes), but I‚Äôm not sure which one. If I learn some data science and sports analytics skills, will they be useful in either field?
Hey Ken! Great video. I've done some simple sports analysis in my own project portfolio. How can I start to find the jobs under type 1, type 2, or type 4? I couldn't find the company z-grew that you mentioned based out of chicago.
do you suggest applying for internship for sport analytics or just self-learning by projects ? for an undergrad.
GREAT VIDEO BRO
Thanx for the videos bro 
Really insightful üòÑ
As a sophmore in college im majoring in stats and want to pursue the moneyball side of business. what would u recomend for a minor?
Hey Ken, great video! How hard is it to break into sports analytics compared to other fields? And would getting a job in sports analytics close doors to working as data scientist in other industries?
Hi ken, just subscribed your channel.üòä
Just want to ask several questions.
1) what should i learn first to join sport analytics industry? Sql? Python?
2) i am interested in Volleyball. Does volleyball familiar with sport analyst? (i dont know if this question is rightüòÖ)
3) does sport analyst earn a lot?

Thank you Kenüíê
ok so i‚Äôve been wanting to get into baseball analytics because I have a friend who is in the field and it is very intriguing. i‚Äôm only a junior in high school right now. how should I get started?
Is it difficult to find a job after completing a masters in sports analytics?
#64: I never had the chance to have time on Fridays or Saturdays for 66 Days of Data, today was my lucky day!
I do like the one that gives insights to make decisions or help the athletes to improve performance.
In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport). 
It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :) 
On that, I think that the psychological component it's not being evaluated, which could be a great area to focus too!
#66daysofdata
Hie.. I am willing to do something related to sports analysis. I've done my graduation in statistics, would you suggest me some good colleges /courses related to sports analytics in USA. Thankyou
Sports analytics is really adopted by many of the reputed clubs and teams. In India also IPL teams are using it and as well as Australian team also shared how they are using sports analytics. 

I also saw the moneyball movie it is really amazing...
Hi! Loved the video! Super informative! I do have a question though. I'll actually be starting my first corporate job as a sports analyst focusing on the second example. But really, I want to get involved in the first type of sports analysis focusing on performance. Is there a way for me to "cross-train" in preparation for the performance role while fulfilling my role as a sports analyst focusing on odds?
im 18 and im tryna transfer into sports analyst jobs.. how does that work?
Thanks for the vid! Helped out a lot. Really looking into the media side.
is there any opportunites for sports analytics in Australia?
Thanks for your content and information. Do you think there is potential in this triathlon sport data analysis?
Hey what do you recommend about soccer analytics? I‚Äôm very interested in it. Any way you could help
How about sports analytics in fight business like boxing and MMA? Is it a thing worth getting in?
Great video
I‚Äôm confused as to why analytics is so important in sports b/c of the A‚Äôs when the A‚Äôs never actually won anything? Where they successful, yes? But they never got a Championship so it ultimately didn‚Äôt work.
Hello, I‚Äôm a computer programmer.  Been looking at getting into sports analytics. Does being older (36) make it harder to break into this field? It just seems like most of the people I come across in sports analytics are pretty young.
Is sports analytics Gambling or no?
Hi Ken,
I am really interested in this field. Specifically, I would like to work for basketball teams and have the moneyball roll. Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve that goal? Thanks
Hi, Ken, can you plzz type the company‚Äôs name in the reply? It‚Äôs the company based in Chicago that works for sports team.  Thanks!
Hi Ken,

The books which you told to refer are for that particular sports or in general?
Great video, very interesting topic, i've been trying to do some analysis in fights, and it's very interesting to see a more broad perspective about other sports, keep it up, you have great content
Great video as always. Just as a suggestion, I would be very interested in seeing good techniques/layouts for building an impressive portfolio to showcase to employers
I want to work on this topic. can you help me?
Thanks for watching everyone! Although not explicitly mentioned in the title, I highly recommend exploring the self taught route. There are plenty of great online resources out there for you to use.

$20K for a bootcamp?!?!?! That's how much my Masters in Computer Science cost!
Hi Ken, I have one question for you. 
Is it possible, and how much likely am I gonna get a data science job through LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc from a different location, working from a different place on the internet, with a data science certificate (like from Coursera, DataCamp, 365), and having good experiences doing different kind of projects?
Many have a contradicted view of what you're stimulating. Maybe you are yourself a graduate and that has overwhelmed you.
People have actually landed as data scientists on Google with self-study. landed
I just recently joined Careera I'm not really sure if it's legit but they have a internship program after
So nothing for beginners. Cool
Hey Ken, so I have a Master's in Data Analytics. Do you think Data camp is good for someone that needs brushing or wants to learn programs that I didn't learn in my program? For example, I didn't learn Power BI or R and my jobs requires alot of Power BI.
Can you give me a data science bootcamp remmendation? Currently I'm looking at local bootcamps but I want to join one with international recognitions. Any suggestions?
So certifications are not really helpful, what are the odds of landing a good job if i do few good projects to add to my resume? Are they promising?
where can i search bootcamp programs ?
Hi Ken! Thank you for the content, I'm letteraly watching every video one by one for a week now üòÇ. 

I'm thanking about starting at data science in a year or so and I think a data science certificate (looking at IBMs) is a good option since I don't have any background at all. Is it a good option to go through this certificate as a part time activity for maybe a year and then trying a job field transition later?

Thank you again. Best
Thank you. Very helpful advice
Thanks for the video! I‚Äôm looking to get into Data science after my bachelors degree in sports management not helping me( Thanks pandemic). So I‚Äôm currently trying to work on some personal projects!
brooo you look just like the dude from lost. the scientist
I work in the government sector, ministry of finance of my country and i like doing forecasts on cash incomes and expenses. I want to set myself apart from my colleagues who all pursue MPA. Would it be a good choice to pursue a Data Science Masters? I got a Bachelor in Econ. by the way with major in macro econ but i would like the flexibility to also work freely in the private sector.
I have done Master's in physics. I wanted to learn data science and currently pursuing a certificate programme. Will it be helpful to land a job?
<3
Hello KJ, you said those that do Bootcamp might not get a DS job, how possible is this judging from the fact that there is a high shortage of Data Scientist??
I have 7 years experience as a business analyst and a BS in Math. In my current role I have been learning and applying data science, so I think I am ready to find a good data science job already, in my opinion. I haven't started applying but I plan to very soon.
Hi Ken! I am not sure if you reply to comments on older videos but I just have a question that would help me a lot for my next step. I am a recent graduate from UCSB with math bachelor's degree. I dont have much data science experience as I only had internship in finance field. I was debating either bootcamp or master's to get my foot into the data field job or internship. Which one would you recommend? (Love your content btw!)
So basically is it modest to say that the silver bullet to get into a good role is:
‚û°Ô∏èto have had Software Engineer/Development education + experience

Else
‚û°Ô∏èto have been submerged  in roles in your current situation (sometimes very unlikely) analyst to scientist
‚û°Ô∏èif none of the above, then to get either of the three things (recommended but not required) but without a work portfolio (professional or otherwise) it is intensively hard
A boring answer yet practical.
I'm 40, want to live in Asia and work remotely. Which should I choose?
What about PG program
What about bachelors in data science?
Hi Ken, thanks for the video! I am a software developer and now learning Data Science with IBM's Coursera Professional Certificate and Practical Stats for Data Scientists' book from O'Reilly. What would you recommend to learn DS the fastest? I am ok with self teaching doing at the moment 1 course + 1 chapter of the book per week. Thanks in advance!
What I see in the market, I most of the data scientist jobs openings require a graduate degree.
Thanx for the help bro üòÄ
Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA  in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python‚Ä¶) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on what‚Äôs best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks
Hey Ken will love if you could update this video for 2022. I am petroleum Engineer and in general I see the application of ML growing exponentially within the field. Not sure if you have anyone in your network that could advise on the transition. I personally been doing MOOC‚Äôs and undecided on doing the  MSc while working.
Hi Ken, I majored in data analytics for my undergrad and have some work experience as a data analyst as well as a junior data scientist. I'd like to transition into the data science side of things and I was actually admitted into a masters program at the university where I completed my undergrad. The cost of tuition however is far too high for me to afford would a bootcamp be the next best choice because of my background?
How can boost my skills with out internship ?
Hi Ken ! I ' ve graduated from Communication and Media Studies. I have some basic practical skills in programming with Python. In your opinion what should I choose? A Bootcamp or a master?
Hey Ken I‚Äôve just finished my bsc in international business and would be starting my masters in data science in a few months. I don‚Äôt have much of a quantitative background and was wondering if I would find the masters difficult?
Hello Ken, thank you for a really insightful video. You got a sub. I am doing my PhD in Chemistry and would graduate next year. Do you have any tips and starting point for me?
Do you have any bootcamp recommendations?
hi ken, thank you for your all useful videos, honesty you should teach too, got a question for you, I'm 39 and taking my data science certification now and planning to get to data science bootcamp, would love to know what do you think? is that a good idea to take bootcamp right after my certification?
Hey great video, very informative...I have a question for you. What would you say to someone looking to get a bachelor's in data science? I'm in my 30's with no degree, my local university (UCCS in Colorado springs) has a bachelors program in data science, and honestly I feel like it would a lot of sense for me to take that route. I, like you mentioned about yourself, need structure around the learning/schedule of it all for me to succeed. Knowing most positions in data science require(or greatly prefer) a masters/PhD, I think a bachelor's degree in the field would be a great place to start, right? I'd be curious to hear opinions/thoughts on this. Was bachelor's just not included in this comparison because it's not as commonly offered? Thanks :)
Hi Ken, recently started watching your videos. Very interesting and helpful content. I am a 31 year old who is going for his Masters Degree in Design to the US in a couple of months. I have an engineering background but I have mostly worked in the social sector and storytelling space. I am interested in Data Science because of the strong career possibilities but also the problem solving abilities. I also believe that as someone in the art and design space with command over Data Science principles I will be able to do more. Out of all these what would you suggest I undertake? My Masters program is 2 years long and while it will be rigorous I think I will be able to make time to study Data Science.
Hi Ken, thanks for your detailed insights on what to expect. I'm looking into a Bootcamp but have little to no experience in the field. Should you recommend that I still do it?
Thank you for sharing your insights.

I am a working professional in the chemical industry (14 years experience) 
with an applied/pure mathematics degree and am at this point of decision making. I have been accepted into my local accredited university for their Masters of Data Science program. I have also been accepted into GaTech‚Äôs Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings.

I really don‚Äôt want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also don‚Äôt have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there.

Do you believe a math degree along with the bootcamp would carry weight? do you know any colleagues that took a similar route? I feel that my math background allows me to be more than capable for the job, but convincing an employer of this without certs or anything else under my belt is a challenge. I am also open to obtaining my Masters while working in data, I‚Äôm all about continuing education.

Any opinions and advisement are appreciated.
Hey thanks for the insightful video.
I am a student of Computer Engineering, recently discovered my interest in data science. What would you suggest me? Should I go for a degree or learn by Google data analytics certificate?
I have to do a mandatory internship so I was thinking about learning by certificate course and applying for internships for role of data analyst.
Hey what do you think about the wgu masters in data science it‚Äôs tuition is quite cheap and is competency based.
Hi Ken Jee,
Thank you for your amazing videos. Im transitioning from a business consultant role and am planning on doing a bootcamp followed by a Masters immediately to finish next year. Do you think this would tick enough boxes to really digest as much knowledge in the most efficient way. The money isnt a big issue - im in Europe and its somewhat cheaper than N America
@KenJee - thanks for this video - nice one! What would you recommend for a manager/director who has data science team under their org chart? What kind of path should they pursue?
Hi Ken, thanks for the video. Just wondering, when you talk about the DS Masters, would that be a post-grad for general grad applicants (from different backgrounds), rather than data/software specific? I'm doing Maths (DA, Ops, Stats) and CS (ML) dual degrees... would that be sufficient, in terms of college qualifications, for most jobs (those not specifying PhD etc)? thanks
Great video! Could you make a video reviewing couple of online certificates or courses, and some bootcamps? I think that‚Äôd really help out someone like me who‚Äôs just starting out and trying to make the best decision possible. Thanks you.
I am currently doing BBA program in Marketing and I will pursue an
MBA program in Marketing as well, however I learned a lot about
data analysis (mostly in excel and spss) and a freelancer as data
analyst in fiverr.
currently enrolled myself in google professional data analytics.
Frankly speaking, data science feels fascinating to me and I want to
learn this as well.
Now, my question is if I self teach data science to myself, will this
bring more chances of me getting into a top position of a
corporate?
will these skills as plus point in my career ?
will these added skills make me stand out than others among my
competitors ?
if I pursue another master's in data science will that add more
value to my resume?
Hey Ken awesome video, there is so much (sometimes conflicting) information out there about data science, it's nice to see you break it down. I just got admitted to Tufts for a master in data science with thesis. My undergrad is in electrical engineering. Just wondering if you know anything about the Tufts programs or would know what to anticipate in terms of career outcomes after graduation?
Data science bootcamp advantage = you are working with an actual data science instead of an academic.
Hi Ken, what would you suggest if I have a Bachelors degree double major in Economics and Business already? Would a certificate be a better option in terms of landing a job at the end than what you mentioned in the video? Thanks!
Data Science Certificate is a waste.
Aye man I‚Äôm thinking about applying for a Washington university data analytics boot camp for under a little under 13k for 24 weeks. I have no experience and but they go over most things in the field. Mentioned about helping with resumes and landing my first job. Also said that they would aid me with the degree if I choose to go further.
Hello :) Thanks for your videos I really love them. I'll graduate this summer and I'll have a master's degree in pharmacy. Right now I'm really interested in Data Science I've started a course on Dataquest and I really enjoy it. Do you think a person like me with a pharmacy degree could be useful in the field of Data Science? If yes I think maybe a Bootcamp would be useful for me.
#63: Aha!!!! Right timing for this video, I'm really happy to find it!!! 
I'm making a decision now, not an easy decision so was great to see the Pros and Cons.
I think you don't mention in the title of this one the SELF STUDY as the 4th option, which has great insights!

Hello Ken thanks for your advices. What do you think about reading books instead of those options ? I'm finishing the electronics engineering and I would like to work as a data scientist. I've already been reading a couple of books, but I don't know if it is going to be enough. 
Thanks!
There's certificates and then there's certificates, right? How does the UC Berkeley Extension Certificate in Data Science stack up?
Hey Ken, is diploma of 1 year is sufficient  to get job??
How to do good project portfolio
Thank you Ken this helps a lot. I am a recent graduate engineer who is planning to change my career into data science. I just wondering if you can suggest how should I build a portfolio?
I do wonder if a certificate would be good if you are already trained in an administrative capacity and they are interested in someone who can do front desk work and a little bit of data analysis. I work in the arts and have an arts degree but I want to branch out in an admin a bit.
Really nice video Ken.  I got my Ph.D. in chemical engineering and recently I'm considering switching my career into the data science field. I have already finished several courses (mostly from Coursera) on ML, SQL, NLP, CV, etc. My current research job only involves simple regression tasks (mostly doable with Scikit-learn, rarely using TensorFlow) with small datasets. I am considering a bootcamp to improve my portfolio, and I am wondering if you can recommend a few good ones (not sure if it is ok for you to say the program names publicly).
I'm considering enrolling into a bootcamp. My only reservation is that I only have my associates degree at the moment. I am currently working on my bachelor's in computer science. Is it even worth it until I have at least my bachelor's?
These are pretty solid tips.  I went through a similar journey since I'm already working and need structured learning. In 2017, I looked at MS CS and MS Data Science programs under $20K that are still decent. What I've seen is Georgia Tech OMSCS ($8,000), Illinois University MS Data science ($21,000), and Indiana University MS Data Science ($21,000).  I failed with my application to Illinois.  I got into OMSCS, I failed my 1st 2 classes and, projected to stay here for a long time. The average class students take is around 1.2 subjects/sem, with a failure rate of about 45%.  I'm finishing up my IU MS Data Science, and hard to find a job still.  What I got is Data Visualization and Management at Ernst and Young (and a lot of my cohorts are still struggling to find work, but easy to get an internship).  If you get into Ga tech OMSCS, it's easier to find job.  OMSCS is data science heavy degree. Subjects include ML, AI, HCI, Computer Vision, ML for Trading, etc.  We even have AI TA's with top-notch teachers and cohorts.
Hi Ken, I'm really enjoying your videos and aspire to be a data scientist in the environmental field. I'm currently working as a data analyst but my projects continually involve just data cleaning/formatting in python and vizualization in tableau. I would like to transition to a data science position where I am able to use machine learning. Do you have any advice for making the transition from a data analyst to a data scientist. I'm reading a textbook on statistical learning to get an understanding of theory but not sure where to go from there. Thank you for making these videos!
Why is he jacked
I'm currently an undergrad sophomore. I'm majoring math and might minor DS. In this case, do you recommend grad school or bootcamp?
What about boot camp and masters together? ü§îü§î
Hi ken, I have a professional health science background-very little computer science or math. However currently doing a PhD in which I am building health prediction models which required intermediate level statistics and some programming in R and SPSS. Do you have any advice that could improve my trajectory into a DS role after my PhD?
Hi Ken, for the project portfolio that you mentioned, has it to be published online?
Hi Ken! I'm new to your channel.. thanks for everything!
I have an economics background but no professional technical experience. Based on the video, it sounds like you'd recommend a masters degree over a bootcamp. I'm wondering your take on why a bootcamp may not be sufficient in getting a data science or analytics job? Not much of a portfolio here, but is that not something you can build out when doing a bootcamp?
Volunteer work where in America is that?
Can I mention 1 data science bootcamp that is good? thanks
Hi Ken, I was graduated with a Finance bachelor's degree two years ago and I'm working at a bank right now. I want to move into a data analyst role, but I'm confused about how to get started. All the data science master degrees would require a mathematics or computer science undergraduate as a pre-requirement, so is it a certificate or bootcamp that would be more suitable for me? I'm studying online courses with 365 data now, but what would be my next step? Thank you so very much!!
Hey Ken, thanks for making this video. I‚Äôll be starting a Masters in mental health counseling this coming fall, but I did always have an affinity towards the data-heavy classes I had in undergrad. I definitely feel drawn to counseling, but perhaps a certificate wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea for exploratory reasons, as you‚Äôd said:) Much appreciated!
Hello, I just finished my Second BA in statistics( the other being economics). I‚Äôm considering a master in ‚Äústatistical theory and machine learning‚Äù. Would this be a good fit for someone looking to get into the data science field ?
Hey ken , I am a 3rd year computer science undergraduate student. And over these years i have taught my self some of the foundations of Data Science. And I was thinking of doing  a masters in data science . But i checked the syllabus of most of the data science Masters and i found out that i have the foundations of most of those courses. So i was thinking if it's the right masters for me?
I'm also keeping an option to do Masters in AI. Since most of data science and AI courses are same . But i think that AI is more Advanced. So please can you guide me?
Thanks Ken! I‚Äôm 53 and am currently a data analyst with mostly DB skills. We merged into a hospital system and I need updated analytics skills. I‚Äôll have a job. Just need the best skills. What do you recommend in my case?
Very helpful.. I have a PhD in systems science and industrial engineering and I'm familiar with all data science/coding topics. But I'm struggling with finding jobs I feel I need to strengthen my skills. What do you think?
Hey I have a Bachelors in Mathematics and I was lookin got take a Data science bootcamp , would you say that my quantitative background along with the projects I would make from my bootcamp would help myself look appealing to some employers ?
hey Ken what is your opinion on online masters compared to traditional masters program
What is your opinion on those of us with 20 years of software engineering backgrounds learning ML as a compliment to our careers. Specifically,  the job prospects aspect for folks in that position?
@Ken Jee what do you think about Data Science master's program offered by big universities like the one given by UMICH at Coursera? Will they be a waste of time or will they greatly help enter the data science industry ?
Data science and big data are overrated and being fashionable is expensive. Data science is new, they teach some statistics, programming and databases. Computer science or mathematics is the right profile to have a solid foundation.
In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!)
Hello, I am sort of late to the game in finding your video.  Any thoughts on where someone with related degrees BS (Analytical Chemistry) and an MBA (Finance) might fall?
Concise and informative sharing!!! Thanks
I have a bachelors degree in Business Analytics. throughout the curriculum we were always discussing data science and used Python, R, SQL, and AWS.  Do you think a data science certificate would pair well with this and increase my chances of employment in this field?
Really great, informative channel! This guy is cute!
I'm a Data Science engineering student, currently looking to what certificates should I focus on getting during my 3 academic years so I can have a better resume, any ideas ? :'(
Great advice as always!
Lol. which one for someone in there 40's with no work experience, only an AS degree. But who has been programming since they where a child, and never been payed for it.. Who also can and has already built tensorflow, keras, pytorch and from-scratch models?

It's so annoying to me when videos like this assume everyone watching must have a Bachelors degree already.
Hey ken loved your video it was very informative this maybe a little unusal story but I have a degree in criminal justice and I would like to have an immediate career change and i was looking into data science/ data analysis which intersted me on how much you can do. I am currently taking on a certificate in data science to see if i am interested and i was wondering how can you create a stand out portfolio  for employers with little to no experience in coding or computer science? Also will learning data science help get  foot in the door into a data analysis position working on programs like R or sql?
Any mechanical engineering structural analysts here with work experience? What are you upselling from this experience?
Hey Ken, I have a 2 year gap while trying for a job from my mechanical degree. It didn't yield me. Now I am shifting in Data Science field. So what would you suggest I do? I already done few courses on Udemy and now I can say I'm familiar with some breath of this field. Now what should I do, will it be necessary in my case two do master in data science or boot-camp OR would just building portfolio and having one or two internship would get  me a job?
I am a QA for 10 years and taking MS in Computer science with focus on Machine Learning. Do I have a chance of getting or successfully transitioning to a career change?
Please share more about personal projects. I have started one but I am not really sure how it should look like at the end and how I should promote it.
Ken, thank you for the information. I am leaning towards a masters course. Further to your discussion, what are your thoughts on getting certified via MS, or AWS, compared to a master degree. To put it in context, I have a accounting/ finance research background.
IBM data science specialization could land you a job if you also take an applied data science and deep learning specialization... All that could potentially take between 1 - 2 years, depending on your commitment. What do you think?
Another question, if we have the funds to pay for a Data Science degree at say Maryville University on line but it is not a masters do you feel that is okay? The other option is for my son to finish his current B.A. in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed. He would then move on to the B.A. in  C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive  he can obtain what he needs in Maryville. This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has 3 more semesters and I would like him to just move on. One is more time, One is more money. Please help with advice.
We have been watching YouTube videos for months...you have the best advice! Thank you for answers, this will help us set our son on the right path forward...much appreciated! Better than the academic advisors at the Universities, I think they have a job to do for the institution and sometimes the truth can not be told or advised. Sorry to express that but you have to follow the "Money Trail".
So what do you think about a B.A. in CS?
So..you think you might want to do a B.A. in Computer Science, would a boot camp help prepare you for that Degree.
Good info...what do you mean by a quantitative background?.
Hello Ken, Thanks for your sound advice. I have a quick question. I am a snr manager with over 18 years of experience. Does it make sense for me to take up a Masters degree in AI and ML at this stage? I am 43 year old with an operations management background in BPO, KPO, call centers etc. I have no programming language background although my maths was pretty strong back then. What do you advise? Thanks in advance.
Lets say i am totally ignorant about this field and i start putting 7 hours a days into learning. How long till i get an internship or a job?
Wow!  Great in depth video. Thanks for explaining all of the pros and cons and what fits different personalities and backgrounds.
What data science bootcamps would you reccomend?
I have done computer engineering and have Btech degree, then I did mba in sales, now I have sales experience of 6 years,I want to change my field and utilise my btech degree in computer engineering, but I don't have any experience.. can you help me guide of how to proceed into data science field.. and how to get experience..!
Very helpful. Thanks for giving such an in-depth breakdown.
I'm interested in Data science and I'm transferring from BS in architecture technology to applied mathematics. Is it better to join a bootcamp like Flation school or spend does years studying applied mathematics? I would not mind getting a low position in data science or data analyst role.
Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion.

I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world.

TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else.
Will you consider making a video about putting together a project portfolio website? It would be really helpful!
Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try "ultralearning" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program. Do you think a psych degree is a handicap or something I can still leverage?
I have enrolled for this course and I am currently undergoing the rigors of it. It would be great if you could check out the curriculum and let me know if this would be helpful and whether it is at par with industry standards. To be honest, this Masters program just scratches the surface but I have found it to be interesting so far:

Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home. I was misled (many of my classmates as well) by those in SLP and believed I could do work from home, but just like many majors they use work-from-home as a marketing strategy and omit info that there are many strings attached to this premise.
I‚Äôm a physician assistant with a BS and MS in Heston sciences. I have a lot of math in my background and some coding though, and can get into a masters. I work for a giant lab right now and think I can manage to get some collaborations if I go into this to practice. I saw the Georgia Tech MS in analytics and it would fit perfectly. However, I do want to be employable and not just literate, would this be a good idea? I can afford it, I work full time so it works for me, and taking 1-2 courses a semester would work for me because I really want structure
Hi. Thanks for this very informative video. Got a question. Would appreciate if you can help me out. I'm doing petroleum  engineering currently. Junior year. I'm starting to get interested in data analysis and data visualization to be more specific.
What would you recommend?
I haven't learnt any programming languages yet but I'm decent with excel.
Hi Ken, 
I'm currently into data engineering with 4 years of experience in big data analytics, wanna move to data science, which one will be good for me !!

Here I have 2 courses in my mind , based on content can you suggest which one is better üòÖ
https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/11/Applied-Machine-learning-course

https://www.edvancer.in/course/data-science-specialization/

Thanks in advance
Hi Ken, great content. I am torn between certificates and bootcamp. I have PhD in Materials Science and masters in both Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering (2 masters). I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well.

What would you advise a person like me? 

I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. 

What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening.
Can you recommend which bootcamp to take if I want an as-close-to-realworld sort of assignment? I'm also very interested to learn the deployment part of data science, like, having my model on a cloud that can be consumed via api, with this whole thing as a docker image, etc

thanks
Hi Ken. I am sure you have answered this question 1000s of times. Sorry. But what data science certification/program would you recommend for me if I am about to pursue a Ph.D. in the health/medical/physiology side of things. I keep seeing 365Datascience...is that a good one to go with?
Hey Ken, regarding getting a Masters Degree, I am confused on which to pursue (MS Data Science, MS Stats and Data Science, MS Information Technology). I want to get into a Data Science career path but I am worried that Data Science would be a fad and I would be struggling to land jobs upon graduation. Most of the job descriptions for a data scientist I encountered requires MS in Computer Science, Statistics, etc
I'm currently a CS student. Would that help me land a data scientist job even without acquiring a masters degree in data science?
what are the odds of self-teaching data science and landing a job ( in comparison with software engineering)?
I come from a background in experimental psychology. I‚Äôve worked a ton with statistics, software packages and both quantitative and qualitative data and I‚Äôve finished the MA degree involving a thesis. I currently work in the clinical side of psych and want to get back into something involving data, stats, marketing and ai. I have experience with blogging, web design and SEO. I‚Äôm considering the route of self-study. I want to start working on some projects and continue working at my full time job and see where it may take me.
Hey ken, I am a  Full stack developer  with 3 years of experience . And want to be a data scientist but have no CS or related degree. So if I take a bootcamp and certificate both and some online courses in Udemy of (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics and probability). Will it lend me a job of data scientist?
Hey Ken, I‚Äôm. Recent graduate with a Biology and Business (Finance and Econ) undergraduate degree and some familiarity with data analysis (Excel, Stata, SQL (a little)). I have a job in management consulting starting in January and am looking to strengthen my data skills. Which of these (If any) would be best for me?
Great video, Ken. This is insightful.
Hey Ken, really informative video, thanks. I'm a 29 year old accountant looking to make the move into data science/artificial intelligence. I'm looking at doing a part time masters over 2 years in Computer science & Artificial intelligence from a good university in England. My original degree was in economics so I have a bit of a statistical/mathematical background. If I build a portfolio of projects over the 2 years what do you think my chances will be of landing a decent data science job once I graduate? Thanks.
Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of "data analysis" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career.

I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. 

With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?
Hey Ken, can you recommend the best universities to get a master's degree in DS?
Hey Ken,
How would you treat the udacity nanodegrees as, inbetween bootcamp and certificates or more towards the certificate side??

For my situation I have an electrical eng background with some minor programming exp, off the top off my head I'd probably upskill in statistics and programming on top of the data science skills to build my foundation, right?
Hi Ken. Thank you for posting this. I am looking to transition into the Data Science world. I am strongly considering going to a bootcamp. I am curious to know what your thoughts are:

 I have a BA in Psychology, have TAed statistics courses. But I have been out of the field for a bit. I am hoping that a bootcamp will help me to quickly learn the skills that will eventually lead me to a job. I am nervous that employers won't take me seriously with only a BA.
What about Masters on Coursera?
You are super awesome for making this video!

I have a history degree (feel free to laugh at me lol), and no documented math backround except that my job in real estate required making and reviewing budgets. I'm really hoping to land an analyst role after a bootcamp.... praying I won't need a bachelors
Hi Ken, I think you're the best guy I can ask this question. I have one year left in the Master of "Economic Analysis & Modelling" in Rabat, Morocco. I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships. Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level. Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid 19. Thanks a bunch & God Bless u.
Hey Ken. I really appreciate your videos. I've been studying Data Science, Statistics and coding, and I feel a little lost about how to build a portfolio. Can you suggest me or give me some hints of how to do that?
Thank you very much, I am not sure whether you have posted video about data analyst or not, but please would you post video which explain difference between data analyst and data scientist.
@ ken jee good day bro and thanks 4 all the content,have been downloading each one, am about embarking on a masters program in data science At the industrial university Tyumen and all I have is a b.sc in mathematics,your videos have been helpful,as I seek to begin a career defining path in data science! But the masters program, I feel a bit insecure having no background in data science but plan on remedying that by going thru your advice on how to start data science from scratch! , plan to use my first year in personal study while learning the language to learn and gain mastery in data science so by the second year while am going into the core of the program,am caught up,what do u think, too much or just ambitious enough! Your honest thoughts would be most appreciated and i
What advice will you give for someone with no background on Science, Engineering, Math and technology but has a business administration degree in Marketing. Should he or she go forba Masters or bootcamp or take the certificate approach?
I have seen a lot of schools offer a business analytics degree with some data science type of classes. Would this work? Also, I have a PhD but my study was qualitative. Does this matter?
Do you know which one is the cheapest Masters Data Science school?
All videos that talk about Data Science are basically: git gud.
Hi Ken, 
This year i will go to college and i'm between a Data Science degree and Computer Science degree. I want to pursue a career in Data Science. I already now some languages of programming (mainly  Python, JS, C and a bit of R)  but i'm afraid that the programming aspect that the Data Science degree has will not be sufficient for the future and also i'm afraid that the Computer Science degree will not give the necessary skills for a data science career such as analysis, statistics etc
I'd like to know if you think that a Data Science degree is worth it or if a Computer Science is better. Thank you and i love your content keep it up.
Hi Ken,

I am a Mechanical Engineer for seven years. I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience in programming or data science. I am looking at taking Bootcamp for Data Sciences at USC, but it is an offer by Trilogy. I got into the program within two days of applying. I try to do research for the validity of the certificate, and statistic of the students who would get a job in data science after the programs. I don‚Äôt find a lot of information. 

I am wondering if my best bet is to go to a Master's Degree in Data Sciences?
Hello Ken Jee, I have Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently working as an engineer for piping company. I am also doing master's degree (online) in IT. I'm eventually trying to get into Data Science. Is getting AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty certification  good enough to land a Data Science job considering I have a master's degree in IT?
Thanks. Really appreciate the breakdown. Looking into exploring into DS, and this has been the best breakdown of the pro and cons if each option. Thanks Ken.
I have a MSc. Mathematics/Statistics. Been trying to land a job in the stats field since I graduated but no luck. Thinking of taking data science to become a data analyst. Planned to take a Master's degree in Data Science but have to forego because there's no scholarship available due to this horrid pandemic. Just started a free data science online course on Kaggle. My question is, am I on the right path? Is it really possible for me to become a data analyst through this path? Hope you can share your insight. I'm so desperate tbh because I just lost my job recently due to this horrible pandemic „Ö†„Ö†
I went to indeed and started researching the local job market, Nashville, for data scientists. Every job required a MS in data science. I immediately can to YouTube and found your video. My intent was to take Harvard's online DS certificate program due to its low cost. Base on what you said in this video I am just going to scrap the idea of becoming a data scientist. You confirmed what I found in my job research on indeed. I am a mechanical engineer and I also have a degree physics. I assumed that this would be a seamless transition. I currently make 6 figures in my current role.  I am not looking to take a hit in salary for an super entry level job as a data scientist if I can even land this role due to the requirements employers are looking for. SMH back to the drawing board.
Hello Ken, thanks for your insight. I am a master's degree holder in aeronautical engineering (engine propulsion). If I were self taught, do I have a chance of getting a job in the data science industry?
Thank you so much, Ken. Your video is actually helpful!
Considering that I am now 45 and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment, I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program. Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased.  It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry  level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end.
Hello! I have a masters in molecular biology and i am interesting in getting into the field of data science not to completely switch career but to help me get more opportunities with analyzing big data in biology. Do you of any resources specific to that? Also what do you think of DataCamp and their career paths?
I'd like to do a bootcamp or a certificate, but I can't pay those out of pocket so I'm just sticking with Masters cause job kinda got screwed cause of covid lockdown üôÉ
Too much resources on the internet makes me so distracted. I personally like learning by doing and I would enroll to a course that gives me this challenges. Thanks for the vid
Hello. Great video! We do appreciate for this information. A quick question; what is your insight for Berkeley Extension Data Analytics booth camps?
I am 45 and a retired teacher looking to start a career in Data Science. I really appreciate this work from you. This is the best advice I have received. Thank You.
I am a certified public accountant and looking to get into an analyst type role. Do you think I would be able to do this with the background that I have? :( thanks so much
I have a UG in Business management, I currently work for telecom infrastructure firm as a service Desk analyst. I plan on getting a masters/MBA  in Business analytics and would like to combine that with Data science by getting certifications from online courses and building projects.
Is it any good?. I'll need your advice sir Ken
Hi Ken, would you say that a data science certificate from a top school is more valuable than some other normal online data science certificates in terms of resume boosting? I am currently considering the data science online certificate from UC Berkeley, which requires taking 5 courses(one core, one programming, one machine learning and two electives on SQL). How would rate a certificate like this?
Hi Ken, I am senior level employee working in finance, but I started gain interest in developing my data skills however being my age, committingg to a master degree will be something I have to think twice, however I have been learning on my own. I found some good and useful course online, and it is really cheap option for me to get started, but I want to get deeper and broader about it, getting a job being a data scientist is not my goal here, my goal is to being an BI Consultant like I am pretty good with Power BI and Tableau, but also possible other tools. what you say mate?
should one get a masters in DS even though you are more interested in Data Analytics and are already an expert with SQL and Power BI? I feel like MSC in DS gives you a better chance to land a Data Analyst role than those without it.
Hello, I am trying to find out some Data Science Certificate programs, no idea how to get around to find them (most of the links from google search just doesnt seem that impressive). I have a Masters in Engineering, working into my Doctorate now. I want to do some work with programming and machine learning later on, so want to prepare for that beforehand. Any recommendations on how to look for some good Certificate programs?
I work as a finance report analyst with some sql queries with visuals in Power BI but its more of a accounting role and  I am trying just to focus on data analysis.  
I have a  Masters in  public administration and did publish work and did go thru statistics class. I am not sure if I should do the Boot Camp or get a second Masters Degree.Boot Camp at my University is about 11 thousand dollars even though I have the money dont want to spend it something useless that will not provide the tools I need to get into the filed. I have seen countless videos and it seems like some ppl say that its a scam but I really want to get an insight .. would you hire me as analyst if I have a boot camp and some prior experience?
Hi @Ken Jee I just completed an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering and also I landed a job as a Quant Developer in a reputed financial firm. I am planning to do Masters in Data Science in next two years. Can you tell me that this kind of job experience is beneficial for me or should I plan to switch my job?
What?
Hey you, Ken! Really nice channel you have here. You've got one more subscriber. =)
.
Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day. And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? 
.
Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. 
.
I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!
I am doing PhD in applied Mathematics, ( modelling on system and control ). I am working with C+, Matlab,  Python. I am pursuing my career as a data scientist / data analyst. Is there any growing field, relates to data modeling ?. In my case, Is it essential to take certificate from like, coursera, edX, .... And what is the main topics / parts should  have to complete?
Hi Ken,

Thanks for the tips. I am working as a developer in cloud and python with 2 years of experience. I have Bachelors in CS. Iam currently pursuing the edx Data Science Micromasters from MIT. Its same lecture as MIT classroom program in Datascience. There are 4 topics Statistics, Probability, Machine Learning, Data Analysis for Social Scientists. Is this a good path to go forward for good chances of Getting a job in Machine Learning positions or Data Science Positions?
Are these skills helpful in the data science roles?
I'm doing a masters in astrophysics right now - it's a lot of experience coding with large datasets, is that good enough to pursue a career in data science or should I look into some of these other options?
Dear Ken, I have done my UG in Biology Science and currently studying in Bioinformatics for masters degree. I have totally no experience in coding before master but now I have some experience in Python, SQL, R, and machine learning(but very basic). My summer internship got canceled due to the pandemic and I'm worried about my lack of experience in real-work job when I graduate this winter. Bioinformatics maybe a bit different and I'd really appreciate to hear your suggestion.
Can you give some options of good masters / certificates / Bootcamps ?
Hi Ken. I'm an experienced financial controller with a MSc in business administration and I took a leave of 6 months. I am looking for a career change to data science and already did udacity Programming for data science in Python. I only have until october to focus on this career change  and was thinking taking the ironhack bootcamp for data analytics (https://www.ironhack.com/en/data-analytics). After october with my demanding job and kids will be impossible for me to study.  I'm looking to be ready for a data analytics role as an entrance in data science market. Do you approve in my case to be the best approach? Thanks
Hi Ken can you explain why on one hand getting lost in the pack of people with these degrees is a concern but within 3 - 5 years it wont be an issue? what do you mean by that?
Hey!  I'm a recent EE graduate who's been expanding my knowledge of Python and learning a little SQL through quarantine and I'm thinking of switching into the data science field.  I've done some ML and deep learning research before but I feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals, although I'm filling them in as fast as I can)!  I got into a pretty good 2 year master's program, but I'm wondering your take because I do have a bit of an analytical background in engineering and I would love to consider a bootcamp or a certificate for the sake of time (especially if I can get started during quarantine).  Any tips?  Thank you so much! :)
I finished undergrad Film and TV production, now I'm doing 365 Data Science and I applied for a Master in Data Science. I will know in 4 weeks.
Thanks Ken ‚Äî i recently subscribed and appreciate the informative videos. Some background ‚Äî I have a background in Math (BS) & Chem Engineering (BS) and have been working in a data engineer/analyst role for the past 5 years at a major automotive company. Although I have a strong quant background, I feel like I need to hone my coding skill set to get to the next level in my work (currently familiar with some R, matlab, tableau, PowerBi). I am considering a online MS analytics from Georgia Tech for its curriculum, reputation, & cost  (<$10K!) ‚Äî also it would be nice to have the added benefit/credibility of a MS. If you were me and wanting to strengthen your coding skill set to get to the next level in data analysis, what route would you take? And have you heard about Georgia Tech‚Äôs online program?
currently I am in 2nd year of engineering  and I know tableau , power bi , python,Django , and I learn and explore mL ....after I completed my engineering it is possible to get on role data scientist job ...with master's ...I mean  After 2 or 3 years ... because I can't afford my Master degree ....is it possible sir..... To get job in good company
For a field that is growing, you provide awesome content for people to navigate through it. Your help is much appreciated.
My question is in regards how to get into data science. 
1) Data Science Bootcamp (which includes programming requirements) > Use that knowledge to work on projects (freelancing, build portfolio) 
2) Start with a full-stack development / software engineering bootcamp, get experience there, and then slowly transition to data science?
Coming from a civil engineering background with little to no coding experience, what sounds better?
I have an undergrad degree in computer science do you recommend a master in data science even though I have zero experience in the field  ?
I have an electronics engineering degree but work as a biomedical technician in a hospital. Haven‚Äôt used any coding since college but use a lot of exceI. I was thinking of getting a data science specialization course and then a masters in data science at the end of the year. School can be partially covered by my employer. I was thinking about moving into an analytics or data engineering role at my hospital. Would that be a good route? Thank you.
simple answer: Bootcamp. I speak from experience. I have only  6 credits left to finish my MS Computer Science degree and I can tell you right from the bat.......I learn more about tools that I will actually use on the job market from youtube not from my masters classes. Bootcamp is more hands on. You learn by working on projects not reading some text book and doing a quiz (The answers to the quizzes are on quizlet anyways)
Good evening Sir Ken Jee. I must say that you have been most helpful to many here and I deeply appreciate it. I have a BS and MS in Pharmacology and Toxicology(biomedical sciences) and I hope to transition into the data science field. With zero coding experience and a fair knowledge of math, how do you suggest I begin Sir? Also, what online courses (with links) would you suggest I start with? Is 365 data science site good enough? Kaggle seems to jump right into machine learning and thus I'm quite wary. So pleaser Sir, could you kindly shed some light? Thanks
I am getting a B.S in Econ, CS, and a minor in Math. I plan to do a bootcamp after i finish my degrees. Does that seem like a good mix to get a job after i finish all of theses?
What are some of the relevant bootcamp programs that you would recommend?
Will a double degree in top CS and Stats programs in undergraduate kind of close to BS + MS? Thanks
Hey Ken, I have an experience of 2 years as an analyst and have just enrolled for Ms in data science remotely from Liverpool John Moore's university, is that worth it?
Hey Ken! I have done my UG in computer science years ago, currently an eSports coach starting my master's degree in eSports this fall, I want to be able to track player performance using game data, also analysing game data which will help me give a deeper understanding of of my team's performance. So far I have been doing this in a very pain staking method of gathering a few key points of data and the comparing them on paper. I am confused as to if I should start certificate program's or just start learning a software such as SQL or python.
 I'd really appreciate to hear your suggestion.
hi sir,please tell some data science bootcamp source.
What is your opinion on someone who pursuing a data science career without a degree? I'm currently self learning by buying course online and planning on attending a bootcamp in the next year.
I spent 2 years studying data science, it was like my own masters.Most of the courses were from Udacity, I really reccomend their nanodegrees because you do a lot of projects and you can add them to your portfolio.
Q. I don't have any particular degree of statistics or computer science but I liked statistics a lot and have encountered in school to graduation days. Now, I want to dive in data scinece domian. So my question is that, certification or micro-masters or masters degree, which one of this courses give me a push for jobs and good career path for data science?
I‚Äôm working on my PhD and taking a 365Data Science course. My head is about to explode!
Hi...  Hope you are doing gud. I am an MBA in Finance Mgmnt nd having 15+ yrs of exp. Pls suggest what shud I do to get into data science field. Thnx
Very informative. I recently became interested in data science, and I'm trying to find out what my best course of action would be. My biggest issue is that I don't have any computer science exposure. I was a biology/pre-med major, and I've been working in the pharmaceutical field for 4 years. I have a decent grip on statistical methods, but again no knowledge of coding outside of excel and a few lines in R. I'm afraid I'd be blown out of the water if I jumped into a master's program right away (assuming I could get into one). I guess my question is, where do you think I should start?
What advice would give to for someone interested in data science but is currently pursuing a cs degree?
Currently a CS student looking at the data science field. I'm in my school's co-op program, and also planning on doing its accelerated Master in machine learning as well. I wonder if you have any take on getting a Master at a small and not as well known college? Right now, I'm finishing my sophomore year and my first internship, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to even get a response from data science-related roles. I'm worried that this will be a snapshot of what's to come even when I graduate, do you think a Master will help with getting past the initial resume screening, or is it not worth it if it's not from a more recognized school? Also, really appreciate the fact you are still taking time to answer questions on old videos!
Master's in astrophysics here! I'm planning to complete two Coursera certificates in Deep Learning (by Andrew Ng) and Data Science (IBM). I have also taken courses in databases and data mining as part of my master's. Hopefully I can get some job responses soon.
Hi,

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++.

And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications. Over the past month I've been utilizing as many online free resources to learn as possible including kaggle, LinkedIn learning, etc.

What would you recommend is the best move for someone in my position? Do you think after I build a few projects I could start applying to entry level Data analyst positions?
Very intuitive. Thanks. I've a Master degree in Physics (specialization: particle physics). I'm thinking of diving into data science. So, apart from what you have said, would you be able to guide me in this regard specifically? What would be the best case scenario in my case? I have a strong background of Mathematics and an intermediate level of programming.
On the lucrative side, does coming in with a Master's Degree boost your potential pay cut?
Very helpful topic, thank you!
If I only take the data science certificate (I.E. like the IBM professional certificate), would that be adequate enough? I have just graduated in Petroleum Engineering where have learned conceptually and mathematically the Oil and gas industry particularly on the upstream sector hance I understand the basics underlying the Energy business?
Hello Ken! 
I'm a new subscriber! I love your channel. I've been going through a few videos. I'm currently working in the social impact sector . I'd like to know more about how I can use data science to grow in my career. I have no background in Data Science but I do have some understanding of the basics of programming. I studied electrical engineering in my undergrad and have some experience with SQL through some previous jobs. My current role is more operational which I enjoy but I would like to explore this area. Could you share your thoughts on the intersection of these two fields? 

Also would like to add, after watching through this particular video, I feel that a DS certificate + DS bootcamp would not be the best fit for me.
I just completed an undergraduate degree in biomedical science and planning to do a Masters in data science and I was wondering how much of a transition would it be if I haven‚Äôt done any coding or maths?
Hi Ken, thank you for the great video! As a four-year experience data/risk analyst,  I think your suggestion makes a lot of sense. A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role. I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about  a master in DS vs Stats. My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background. And plus, fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later. Could you please share your thought on this please? Thanks!
I'll be going to General Assembly for Data Science in July.  I'm currently working on my math and Python skills as I don't have a professional Analytics background (coming from Sales).  I'm really grateful for your insights as to how to make something out of my own circumstance!
Yes but can a data science certificate get you a job as a data analyst? I would imagine that it could, and then that could be leveraged to get into a data science/data engineering role.
Hello ken! New subscriber here.
My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job. After completing my 1.5 years, I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created 3 personal data science projects. Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad. 


Also loving the content you put out!


Thanks
Hello sir , I'm currently enrolled in computer engineering in university and there are some of the courses (which are basic for datascience)  in my syllabus and i'm willing to get more of data science but I'm confused ? What can I do for it ? Will I take free courses or join bootcamp or get online certificate?
I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science.  This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either.  Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates.  The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.  In saying that university education in Ireland is  a lot cheaper.  My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time.
Hey Ken, thanks for the video. I have a question I hope you could help me answer. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses. My question is, do you think getting a Masters degree in Data Science is suitable for me, and what are the chances of me getting accepted into the program? Thank you very much!
I like it!
Hi Ken, i have a PhD in mechanical(thermal modeling), with 15 years of R&D design, investigation and project management experience. i have finish data science core from Edx with a certificate. it includes intro to python, SQL and essential maths in python. i am currently doing anther certification with 365 data science, it has 23 modules. I had done coding, mathematical modeling, and matlab script simulation during the working years. i had done a lot of maths in high school, especially the whole of statistics. i am currently thinking of doing a bootcamp in my country, which originally cost USD 20k, but able to get a discount down to USD 5k. its is a twelve week course, and i plan to take 2 months leave for the course. i agree with you about the networking the bootcamp can offer and also skeptical that all the online certificates can land me a data scientist job. what do you think? thanks in advance. great vedios that you had uploaded. i learnt a lot.
I am currently working on a BS in Comp Science with a certificate in Data Science using electives. My plan is to enter the workforce after graduating then work on a MS in Data Science online. What are your thoughts on this plan?
i have a question , i already have my masters in science , been doing data for 5 years but want to learn more , joining a data science bootcamp to movie on . ? and upgrading a job  does this helps ?
I have completed my degree in Software Engineering, I was actively looking into data science roles. What do you think I should include in my resume? and also I was taking a data science Bootcamp course on Udemy, will that be good enough to apply for data science roles?
Thanks for the video really helpful, what you suggest, if having master degree in computer science and 4 work experience as an ETL Developer(bit part of data engineer)?  
Also how u see positive ans negative point of work experience as an etl Developer will help to moving to data Science.
this is a really good video for us, thank you
very informative video Thank you!
Can anyone recommend any good Bootcamp? Thanks in advance!
I have done Software engineering. Should I get Master degree in Data Science now to become a Data Scientist? or self learning along with various certificates and bootcamp and other online material is enough.
In my engineering, I have learned almost mathematics you have mentioned one of your video.
I'm doing economics and statistics degree and I'm already self taught software developer. I'm good at Python too. 
My question is, if I teach myself data science,is the this econ stat degree going to help me in the job requirements or they just need data science cert?
And is it possible the math  taught in my class ( Calculus1 &2,statistics and linear algebra)  may cover for the maths required for data science or I need to learn more maths?
Thanksüôè
What about getting a bachelors in data science? Should I do anything after it or go for jobs right away?
Thank you so much for putting this content out.  It's an invaluable resource for someone like myself who is in the process of applying to grad school.  I was wondering if you think the pros and cons of a masters degree outlined in the video would apply to a masters in statistics as well?  I'm currently working in a completely unrelated field and I'm applying to mostly stats programs but a few data science as well.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
Hi Ken, thanks for another insightful video! I have my BA in applied mathematics, and have been studying programming and machine learning in python for 6+ months now. I prefer self studying over schooling because I feel  like I learn best that way. One problem I'm currently facing is that a lot of entry level and internship level Data Science/Analyst job postings require either a PHD or a Masters degree. Should I keep putting my focus on my coding projects for my online profile for employers to see?
Hello Ken, I love your videos. I have a question.
How I can know if I am ready for applying to internships or not? I have done few online courses on data science and worked on some projects during the course but still I have low confidence which always stops me from applying to internships.
great insight !
As an undergraduate data science major, I've worried about not being able to land a data science position immediately after graduation. A lot of companies still seem to require a masters degree or at least 2-5+ yrs of experience for data science roles. I wanna carefully anticipate that these requirements would change within a couple of years to where undergraduate students are welcomed to apply, as I believe data science field is growing rapidly!
Can you talk about how you got your experience into data science and what you think about people coming from a Data Analyst role
Thanks for watching everyone! If you're looking for specific resources to learn from, there are plenty of great free and paid ones. 
Some free ones I like:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/
https://www.learnpython.org/
Paid one I like:
365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY 
- Course taught by YouTuber "Python Programmer" is really solid. Also have access to the other data science courses!
I'm curious, what are the new programs used, seeing that this video was made 2 years ago.....which languages are in trend
Do i need to learn Computer algorithms like searching sorting algorithms
Lol. I like how you talked about the programs people used for stats. We old farts used a pencil
Yes, it is such a big downer to know statistics but to don¬¥t be able to do a fing simple thing because absolutely nothing works and you can take 3 hours surfing from one topic to another on stackoverflow because you can¬¥t even ch ange the color of a table. I miss Spss so much
Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.

I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.

Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?

That was long winded, but thanks!
1.5 speed is your friend
Awesome content.  I just signed up for Kaggle yesterday I think (days are running together.  I work from home) and I 100% will be sure to try this approach.
I have learned variables, loops, all the way to functions and objects. What do you think should I learn next?
LLLLove your videos so much,  not only the content but also the way you talk. It‚Äôs vastly helpful for me as a non-native speaker.
I really reallllllyyyy appreciate your finely presented videos, thank you.
Walking on your footsteps
#62: Now it way easier to learn how to code, great insights, and links.
in my prehistoric times, I learned Pascal with a book only and I could practice at my College PC's, then I learned C, C++, Java, and from there everything in programming it's easier, recycling code is the best, I think is what I love the most from Python!!! #ILovePython :) 
#66daysofdata
I‚Äôm starting at 14 your videos inspired me to do that
You answered my questions exactly! I was very lost where to start and didn't know a Python was the actual language to start learning. Thanks!!
Hi, Is it necessary to learn Java or C++ before learning Pythpn?  Because sometimes using python we can not learn some programming concepts in deep.
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
cyber security or data science which one is better i have heard people saying cyber security is recession free career even in this pandemic most of cyber guys got even hike SOC or cyber audit roles would you recommend to someone as a fresher or data analyst is good option.
@Ken Jee: What is the time horizon for these 3 steps?
Data science or Cloud computing? I am very confused
What do you think about codewars/ leetcode?
Does it feel relevant to advance coding skills in python to a really high level? For example, does it make sense to invest time to become kata 5 in codewars or to solve medium difficult level in leetcode?
Thanks
Hello, where do you recommend learning the necessary statistics needed for Data Science?
where did you go to college and what did you major in? I really like your videos!
The content you post is exactly what I needed to trace my roadmap to become a Data Scientist. Keep up the good work!
Your videos are really helpful and Kaggle is great!
have just discovered today that have not subcribed to your channel poor me..lol
Is 7 months sufficient to learn data science , considering I put 6 hours per day daily?
Excellent job!!
Excellent ideas. Thanks for sharing!
4000 views? Really?! These videos are highly, highly underrated. Keep up the good work, Ken!
I'm trying to navigate how to teach myself python with the goal of becoming a data scientist. Your channel is a goldmine of great information, thanks for all of your  help!
I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data. Also you can use R and Python together.
Do data scientist have to know as much programming as actual programmers?
Wow, you are spot on on everything. Good job, enjoying your videos. So informative and helpful
Great channel, answered most of my questions that I‚Äôve been having about starting out in DS. Question, should ML be learned before doing projects? I‚Äôm average in R, getting better everyday, but feel as if I don‚Äôt have enough DS skills to start doing projects without knowing any ML. Thoughts?
I‚Äôve been on this journey for a few months now and these videos along with other online content have been useful for checking my progress and keeping myself on track,
THANK YOU SO MUCH
These videos are definitely reducing my studying anxiety haha. It's good to know that the struggle is normal and not something to be intimidated by.
Hey everyone - Thanks for watching! Sorry if the volume is a little distorted, I thought I fixed the problem, but it looks like I haven't. Will get it figured out by the next fundamentals video!
Is there an updated link for the Lahman database? The existing link is no longer found
Hey Ken, how to use SQL in data science?
Hi Ken, registered for your conference on 18th and 19th May.
Hey, Ken. I have installed SQL Server Installer for Developer Edition and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - 18.8

But while Restoring the database I am getting the following error. You said that you will link the video for how to install.. Can you help me with this error?


TITLE: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
------------------------------

An exception occurred while executing a Transact-SQL statement or batch. (Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo)

------------------------------
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The media family on device 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\LahmansBaseballDB_2018.bak' is incorrectly formed. SQL Server cannot process this media family.
RESTORE HEADERONLY is terminating abnormally. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 3241)
#61: And again, the sound of a siren he he
Great tutorial, basic and understandable. 
I have done a lot of SQL in my life, a LOT! Short story, a tool was badly developed in one of my past jobs, so I had to do an App SQL version for the users to fix all the unfortunate trash that the application was doing to the data, what a mess!!
#66daysofdata
Thanks again Ken !
Thank you so much, I was looking for a way to host a local server for crunching some baseball stats and you nailed the setup.

I ended up following you down your queries for fun and noticed that when I went to save my view, I got this error.

"Column names in each view or function must be unique. Column name 'playerID' in view or function 'WinningPitchers' is specified more than once."

I found that curious since that's just from when we quoted out our join.
Is this microsoft sql server the same as mysql?
Please make more of these
SSMS can not be implemented on MAC OS, is there any other tools that I could use on the MAC OS? THANKS
Hey Ken. ¬øWhat can I use in a Mac since SQL Server is not available for Macs?
Hi Ken, thanks for your sql tutorial video, which is very helpful and inspiring!. I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video.   
select bat.*, pitch.*
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join (select *
from dbo.Pitching
where W>=10) as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where AB>=40
instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:


select bat.*,pitch
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where Ab>=40 and W>=10;


my question is:  when should we use subquery? it looks complicated and easy to make a mistake during usage.
Great refresher! Been binge watching a lot of your videos to resume my studying of data science
Please keep the Data Science Fundamentals Series going, it's really helpful!
Thank you so much for the tutorial.
Please upload the whole series about SQL.
Please enlarge screen next time and font size
Definitely coming back to this video.  This is a fantastic set of questions
i think u are the only one on ut that talks about it
its a very good video, thanks!
this is important af!
#60: Very interesting this one, I know you are focus on DS but this could be an overall reminder of what to ask when you are finding a job, the one I like the most was about the development opportunities are there within the company? 
We must grow, remain the same doesn't help to our environment.
#66daysofdata
The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations? As an interviewer, I'd view that question in a negative light. But there are ways around it and you can still get that sort of feedback indirectly. Apart from that, great video and great tips from you as always. Keep it up.
Thanks! I've learned a lot from your channel~üòõ Could you post something about the case study in DS interview(some non-technical part)? I feel like it's also important for data scientists ü§î
Great!!
I'm going to give ReadSpeeder a try. I've taken a number of speed reading courses before, and none of them really stuck. However, if you were able to read Greene's _Art of Seduction_ in a week, then it must've done something right by you.
That's a very big list to read. Started the readspeeder course today , Will practice it everyday.
#59: Seriously 52 BOOKS!! What the !!!!üìö
That's crazy, you are my hero!
As always is really nice to hear your reviews, I must confess I'm not good at reading, so Audible is becoming my best friend, I'm now hearing Designing your life, and is a book that is changing my life. 
Also on paper, I'm on Mathletics, I'm taking notes, I hope to read at least the nine that you recommended! 
#66daysofdata
You probably have the reading process down, but check out Speechify. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx8H9-jmYPw
Can't Hurt Me and Deep Work are great books. Just a little suggestion, it would be much easier to create and share your profile on Goodreads.com :)
Hi, I've heard also some negative information about this book "Why we sleep". I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it. Your channel is great anyway, keep up with the solid work!
Super helpful video/links! Thank you so much for sharing. I finished "The One Thing" last week and was super happy with it! Definitely my preferred type of book! I just wanted to know where you found these books? Were they recommendations from colleagues or possibly a list of books found on a website? Also, if you had any recommendations on books to learn more about statistics, I would love to hear about them! I took statistics in undergrad (which was a few years ago) and am in the middle of a career change and would like to brush up on the theories and the essentials for data analytics/data science!
Thank you for those valuable recommendations,
I've just placed an order for the "one thing" :)
Side note: the Weitzman institute is in Rehovot, Israel. not in Europe
That's a lot of books! I love reading and this is right up my alley. Thanks for the recommendations!
Thank you so much for sharing these books! I really appreciated how you share information with people!
Another great video! Out of curiosity, how did you make the time to read one book per week?
Your honesty about affiliate links is highly appreciated. Can I ask why are you focus so much on your videos? What is the long term goal here?
Great vid Ken. Looking forward to more content in 2020
So detailed wow! Thank you!
Me hitting a like before even watching the whole video üòåüòå
What are some of the companies you have found that have a good data culture?
Damn ken, almost a year and a half from this video, you have improved a lot, but always maintaining the quality of content
Guys what do you wear or what can you wear or what is acceptable to wear in a data science interview ?
#58: Sound scary, more for an Introverted person üòÖ
Thank you for the tips and the links related!! A lot of work to do to be ready üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
#66daysofdata
This is like... for people who already have quite some experience right? Like it's gotta be different if you're going for an entry or junior position, right?
How long typically the inperson interviews?
Ken, thank you for such an informative video! When you mentioned live coding interview tests, does that only include leetcode questions or could we also expect kaggle-like questions? 

From my experience, kaggle-like questions are usually take-home assignments, but I've not heard yet whether companies ask us to live code on Google doc using Pandas or something alike.
Hey Ken, great video! I was wondering if you ever had any onsite modeling interviews. I have one coming up in 2 weeks and the time limit is 2 hrs. Would it be similar to a takehome assignment?  Thanks in advance!
Thanks for your video! Is the interview process for the internship roles the same as the full-time ones? For DS, what questions are recommended in leetcode? What about the coding languages? Is it better to use python rather than java or both are ok?
Thank you üòä this helps a lot!
Would you recommend someone getting a data analyst internship before a data science internship? Or just go straight for a data science internship?
#57: Hey Ken, how that year went for you? Did you wrote understandable code, attended + DS events (This I think was tricky, the things we can't control), updated your README ‚û°Ô∏è Github, participated in Kaggle competitions, and made projects accessible (‚úÖ I think you kill it in this one, 2020 was the year where I knew you and has been a great journey!)
I just making you accountable he he üòÖ
#66daysofdata
Great resolutions! Some of my comments:
1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a "good code" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting "classic" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.
2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be "consumed" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient.
3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!
4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often.
5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.


My resolutions:
1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a "cog" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.
2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.
3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)
4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML
5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert
6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field)
7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!


Thank you for an interesting and relatable video!
My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall.  I will be using a lot of Codecademy, Dataquest, Udemy, and Kahn Academy. I would also like to have a handful of smaller projects uploaded to GitHub before the end of next summer.
I‚Äôm new to data science and would like to know what you think the best programming languages are in the current state of the field.
As an analyst my resolution is to scrutinize each element of my reports and dashboards more.  I tend to focus more on the big picture and forget to focus on how each element could be improved.  As someone who is trying to learn data science my resolution is to give myself a project that seems achievable and finish it by the end of the year.  Documenting is one I think almost all of us can work on.
I can't imagine explaining data science, I have enough trouble as it is explaining my job as a data analyst.  It has gotten to the point where I explain data as paint, a blank excel or power bi file as a canvas, and my job is to paint a picture that speaks to my audience.  Still think only half of my friends really understand.  Most just say "oh so you know how to do pivot tables" and move on.
Does this do LIVE games as well? I‚Äôm into cyber security so not heavy coding skills but i came across this and see VSCode isn‚Äôt going to cut it so what IDE do you recommend and what tutorial to use it properly also I want to implement a betting formula through this with live betting can this repository handle that?
Really useful video! Thanks Ken!
Hi Ken,

Thank you so much for this  video!  I was able replicate everything you demonstrated in it.  My goal is to have all the games for several seasons showing the away team on the left with all their stats and then have the home team on the right with all their stats. I was trying to understand the TeamGameLogs endpoint but don't know enough about it to see any of its data.  Can you point me in the right direction or perhaps do a video showing how to do this?

UPDATE:  Well..I got started in figuring it out.  The code below only gave me the 2016-2017 season and only the Team stats, none for the opponent.  Here's the code I used to get the games in the game log.  Not quite structured as described above, but all the games nonetheless.

from nba_api.stats.endpoints import TeamGameLogs
all_games = TeamGameLogs()
all_games_df = all_games.get_data_frames()[0]
all_games_df.to_csv('nba_gamelog.csv')
Hi, great job! one question: how can i get all games from all teams from year x to year y ?
bro, thanks
great content - I am looking for other similar APIs for other major sports - NFL, MLB, NHL.  does anyone have suggestions
Thanks for this, mate!
Can we use this api with R?
this video is fantastic - thanks Ken!
what are you pressing after you select the code to see what it spits out?
Thank you Ken, this content is amazing!
I get a timeout error when trying to get data from GameLog in a Google Colab, does anyone have the same problem?
This is my first hands-on on spyder. It is a really nice tool.  I just tried the commands through the video only but it was interesting. I tried to understand the terms mentioned in it. I will try to explore more about it and will try different variations. Thanks, Ken for the video.

Is there an API for NCAA basketball stats???
Is the get_teams() function pre-written??? I'm confused as to where that comes from. Also, love your vids!
Hey great info... currently working on a project and I have a few questions for you...
Hey guys! I new to all this and I need it for my IT class. Sh mabye there is someone who could help me. To begin with I can't even install the module and I have no idea why. I've searched and tried a bit but not found a solution yet. Second I basically need all this turns around, so I need the program to show me players in a range around after I search for a certain stat. If anyone know how to help me or can tell my where to find help I would be really grateful. Everyone have a nice day.

Hi Ken. I am able to retrieve the team and player data and their ID. But I just couldn't retrieve the a specific player's data to the variable explorer. Plz help. Thanks
Hello. Can you show me how to get boxscore and andvase state from single games. I just dont understand the best this endpoint section in nba_api
i'm starting to get timeout errors like the one below: "ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='stats.nba.com', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)"  when trying the playergamelog endpoint. Have you encountered something like that before?
Thank you so much man!
Hey ken, thank you so much for the video! Would you be able to do another video on incorporating other parameters to pull all player for the last 5 games with per game averages instead of the totals?
Hello Ken, Thank for your video, BIG HELP!!!! I wanna do a project of shoot chart, do you know which packages that can help me quickly get the player's shooting data, like located_X or located_Y
Did they teach you how to use python in school or did you learn by yourself? Just wondering because I was curious about this job since I am staring to think about what I want to do, but I am currently doing computer science and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be for me because it is kinda hard and its only lasting for 3 semesters . But anyways good vid I started to learn what the job is about üëç

Excellent video, it is worth noting this is based on spreads/totals with standard hold priced at -110 or 1.91. I am starting a trading analyst role in the sports book industry soon myself, and think your channel will really help advance my skills and thinking all around, so just wanted to say really appreciate what you're doing!
In Glad i found you here
Particularly interesting considering I recently got an offer for a sports betting hedge fund. Thanks for the videos, they‚Äôre really detailed and been overall so useful
Thank you for the details. Also, Would you like to share your opinion on Social media + Data science?
#55: Love your honesty about getting into this field, sports are more than betting but what we can do, it's also a business. 
I do like the analysis & the insights of the data in sports, and from that perspective, your videos have been really helpful! AS always, thank you!

Apparently, because people are jumping on the Data Science bandwagon they‚Äôre subsequently helping increase the demand for physical Mathematicians. The money is nice. You are absolutely correct, it does make one feel burned out. I suggest anyone who has children put them in classes NOW it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are 5-10 do it. However there will always be a need for applied Mathematics
Having learnt c++ and c#, i studied python in a week, it was so easy it was starting to demoralize me.... i find web scraping really cool, because i wanna do it for personal interests, maybe trading, i still dont know
When are we not in ANYTHING for the money?
Hello
I am above 50 years old - I have Master degrees in Business Administration and Statistics . I have also done  programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area. Recently I have acquired knowledge of ML with Python. I wonder why I didnt think about being a data scientist earlier ! Anyway I want to be one one now - almost at the fang end of my career.. I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA. 
I am a very fast learner .
Can anyone help me in getting data scientist or analyst or business analyst job anywhere in the world? I know my age maybe a negative point but then I have vast experience of working in different business area.
What if you have a strong dislike for math?
I'm so happy that YouTube recommended me this channel. I noticed that being a data scientist was my childhood dream it is just that I didn't know the name until now. I just used to say "I'm going to be a researcher". Thank you for all the thought you put on your videos!
Can't tell you how bored I am these days. If I've succeeded autonomy in my kitchen as the room chef, I literally am bored out of my mind. There's nothing to solve, there's nothing to improve on. Even if there is, its not happening frequent enough to keep me on my toes. I think, aside from the money, data scientist might be something that would allow me to challenge myself and that's something I'm jumping into.
Honestly autonomy is the reason I got in but I do get stuck in wrong thinking sometimes
I thought the field of Data Science was all "Money for nothing, chicks for free". Apparently i was wrong. üòÅ
@Ken Jee So what else can I do? I am definitely in it for the money.
In short its bad for introverts
hey some one please put him in jail please
You forgot uncomfortable with mathü§£üòÅüòÅü§£
I was interested in pursuing a career in clinical psychology when halfway through I realized I loved working with the data. Currently a junior in college and a bit stressed because I feel like I'm late to the game, but I am glad that I seemed to have found the right fit from what you said
#54: Oh my! I never tried skiing (not sure if I will... I always think is not safe üòÖ and you are giving me the reason he he) 
I do like you being emphatic about the love for DS and what is needed to make it meaningful, like all things in life, require commitment, STUDY, and community! 
#66daysofdata
nice click bait
I appreciate your thoughts! 
Well made video. Also ..What do you think about the future of Data Science, analytics , Machine Learning  ?
AI is rising and automation will surely hit this field some are even saying Data Scientists will be outdated and automated by 2025-2030... as AI and AutoML like emerging technologies  analyse data more efficiently and faster..
I am in no way discouraging anyone its just that these things are being heard often nowadays..Also which UG will be better Economics or Computer science in the long run ! 
I need your perspective :)
Get a mic bro
Personally, it's because it's something I've always been into and as a marketer and content producer, It's a skill that would enlighten and facilitate our job and my businesses.
In short the reasons (from description):
#datascience
1) You are in it for the money
2) You don't like autonomy 
3) You are uncomfortable with collaboration
You are a honest guy .. I love it !!!!
I strongly agree with you about the three rasons in order to not become in a data scientist but I think as you told, depends on your position or your goal. For instance, I think in the resarch area you have less collaboration because most time you are the only one that know your work or your novel investigation so it's sometimes hard to display this to others.  I think there are many resources for learning data science hence the main problem to become in data scientist is the patience and self-confidence.
Hi Ken, I watched many of your vedios and I found very interesting and helpful. I have a doubt with my profile evaluation. Can you help me out please.
I did graduation from civil engineering in top NIT's. After my grad, I was working as a Mathematics faculty for colleges. Will this experience count if I apply for data science masters degree. Thankyou
Wonderful. I‚Äôm the polar opposite of everything you said
I think the reason why I would like to get into Data Science is just the outright versatility it can offer in many sectors such as finance,healthcare,IT etc. The whole concept of breaking down and finding solutions is interesting. I started to doing a Python course and I'm really enjoying the coding but I just wanted to ask I come from a Finance background with some banking experience. Can you please give me some tips on what I should do exactly? Thanks!
That's really helpful!!
I was thinking of taking data science because it involved coding. But now I'm not so sure about it.
i just cant solve kaggle problems should i quit this field its been 10months already
3rd point is my biggest hadicap :'(
Data analytics has a future?
I like the fact that you made it clear that these aren't inherent skills or character sets, but that they can be learnt!! :)

I would work more on collaboration for personal projects both in Ds and web development
Hi! What's the best major to become a data scientist?
Very informative. Well done. Thank you.
thank you Sir, this was informative, indeed!
I think data science is the first career that I've considered where I didn't look up the salary before looking into it more lol
Money - Check
Need for Autonomy - Check
Creativity - Check
Uncomfortable with Collaboration - Failed (I personally struggle in driving others to deliver)

These are in-sights with great clarity. Thanks a lot.
I got 2/3 in my favour. The 3rd is something we can learn.
I just graduated with my Bachelors and always thought data science was interesting and that it was the path I was going to aim towards. But recently with the low amount of entry level DS positions available and the overwhelming amount of material to know, I have been debating on changing career paths. I definitely underestimated the level of knowledge and expertise you need in order to be in this field. Watching this video has helped me realize that maybe it isn't the right fit for me. I am personally uncomfortable with autonomy mainly because I haven't had any prior work experience. I definitely have a lot to consider. Thank you for sharing :)
Great video. As a woman, I experience pushback even from family members for just being interested in science, let alone math & data. I just decided after a year that THIS is what I want to do.... switching from Agriculture. I told a family member who does something slightly similar to Data Science... and he literally asked me if I am sure it is what I want to do because it is a lot of numbers. 

I am excited about switching majors and going for this‚Äº
Due to covid the aus government is sponsoring retraining and data analytics stood out for me. I come from an arts/business major and I'm an English Second Language Teacher. All the work has dried up and I was transitioning to work in film but with restrictions that won't be possible anymore. So I've decided to retrain. I dont know if data science/analytics is right for me because I havent tried it, however I did do well in stats at uni and maths in school. I figure ill give it a go and if i dont like it then what the hell, i only spent $2500 for 6 months of which i wouldn't have worked anyway. Thoughts ? Just researching this has kept me up at night
Build a project for next Ryder Cup winner...I'm fact don't need to as it'll be Europe ;) 
enjoyed the video. From Northern Ireland
You speak to slowly
I started reading about stat 2-3yrs back, also learnt indepth theory for linear, logistic regression etc, did very basic kaggle project. I work in bank. 6 months back i got my first real life banking modelling project. Dara quality is horribly bad. I have seen rather than the process its good engineered feature that improves the model. But what demotivates me after much thought also, my features don't improve model. Also i am not good at finding good insights. They are average. Any tips?
I'll be graduating with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering and I'm looking to do a masters in Data science and business analytics. Would this be a good combo?
My major in college is Economics and I want to follow a path in DS, what do you think?
Well, I find this motivating <3. Even if I lack the confidence to collab, I can learn that on my way.
If I'm ever able to land a data science job it'll be because of you
Thanks for such great content in a simple, crisp, precise package. I've only watched like 2-3 videos of your channel. 
It's praiseworthy how you deliver precise content without much of visualization in such a simple, no-nonsense manner.
Subscribed and liked for the QUALITY! :) 
I hope you keep getting better and go on more adventurous rides and return without injuries! :P
Ur a true inspiration to people who strive to achieve greatness.
I would learn almost anything for $120k.  I would clean toilets, put stickers on car parts, hold a sign on the side of the road, eat wasabi, whatever.  You can buy a full-sized house after only a couple years of savings with that kind of money.  Most Americans haven't had that standard of living for 50 years.  I only hear rich people say that you shouldn't do x for the money.  It would be more convincing to hear that from somebody who quit a data scientist job to go work at Walmart.
I hate collaborating but the reason why I want to take data science is because I want to end up in AI research
How important is it to have a master's degree for getting a job? I'm currently an undergrad CS major with a Stats minor, and I honestly feel like I can learn what I need online without a master's.
Well, it seems to me that this video is far better than any of all of the other videos on similar topics. Straight to the point, clear, precise in the right way. I just wonder why so few visualizations.
Do I still have a chance to go for data science if I am not gud at maths
What if you aren't best programmers but enjoy and good at stats and maths side of it
I think you are good looking
1.  you're in it for the Money
2.  you don't like Autonomy
3. you're uncomfortable with
  colaboration.

THANKS ME LATER
Get well soon.
Ken, thank you for your content! I participated in Stanford's 5 week course titled Code in Place and we're now in our final project phase. We spent the past five weeks learning Python. I found your videos through searching "data science for beginners what is data science" in efforts of getting ideas for what kind of final project I want to try üòÇThe 5 week pace of the course was absolutely too fast for me, but I am so glad I found your channel. After this video in particular, this is definitely a path I want to continue learning about (ie what new information can I read by using methods beyond my usual qualitative analysis approach to things), and you've already helped me create a learning path beyond this course. Thank you! I look forward to more content
Curious, where'd you get those glasses? lol
There is no shame to be DS for make more money.  When I will make money i will love what I do.
Im getting interested in programming and have a regular science degree with no background in mathematics.. The idea excites me.. but with no experience in maths its probably too bigger decision for myself :(( maybe ill just stick to Spatial science, we will see
There's not enough content in this video to fill even the 10 seconds in the beginning when you ask everyone to subscribe. Is it just me or YT is a time black hole?
Good content üëçüèª
I am interested in AGI how can I move forward if I choose path of data science (is there any other path)
It will be hard for me, i dont like collaborating with people because i dont like arguements
Phew! I thought you were going to say "For the girls.".
He is just saying you can learn anything if you are honest to your work!
Thanks for this video. I am an "analyst" trying to decide if I want to become a data scientist but it seems like some of the things I dislike about my role may be the position and not the company. I'm the only analyst with nobody to ask questions, less prof development opportunities, and nobody knows what I do :( The autonomy/expert thing kills me! I'd much rather have a team and people who understand benefit of my work. Have you experienced being in your own little corner or being way ahead of your companies' resources?
Helpful video.
1. Should I go for Data Science if I want to work as a remote employee?
2. Should I go for learning Data Science if I am 35+ years of old having business graduation majoring in MIS (database management system)?
Thanks for good advices, I'd like to work in future as a Data Scientist but the essential element for me is having a partner to learn or do something together and I wonder where can I find a group of people to do a project together
Hmm, I just found out I don't match any of these. Which in fact makes me consider becoming DS.
The autonomy part though
Hope you are fine now.
Glad I found your channel. Pretty much gave me a roadmap for getting into the field. I‚Äôm an analyst now but would definitely like to do sports data science. Seems like a dream job!
I don't agree with some of these points, I think if you are the expert of your company then you need to jump into bigger challenges. Nothing worth solving is done by 1 person, you usually work in a team of data scientists, data engineer, machine learning engineers so ask for help when needed (don't over do it obviously) but PLEASE! don't have an ego unless you are Ian Goodfellow and he seems very humble so please don't have an ego.
As a Data Scientist myself I totally I agree with everything you just said!
I feel like the creativity mindset is SOOO important. I'm currently still looking for my first data science/analytics job, but while on the lookout I'm working on my own projects. It definitely takes a lot of creativity to approach certain problems you want to find an answer to.
Get well soon Ken!!
Ken, get well soon! Best regards from Russia :)
Hope you get well soon!
thanks for this amazing video ken,can you suggest some good books for soccer analytics
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
I realize you are focused on sports analytics, but if you have not yet read The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis then you should. It's a good read.
Sir I want to make a career as a soccer analyst.Can you please recommend some books on soccer analytics
Hi Ken, is there any lead I could follow to get into European Football analytics? (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, etc)
Can u suggest an analystic book for badminton ?
Yes  very Informative.
Hi, thank you for your recommendations! I just started Mathletics, but I was wondering if you know any NHL analytics book you can recommend us? Greetings from Canada!
Thanks for the recommendation of books...
Which book I need to read for cricket
#53: This is so valuable, thank you. I'm now reading Mathletics but I was wondering if you have found out books or information related to Endurance/Power Sports Disciplines (Track & Field, Swimming, Marathon, Weightlifting, etc.)
Thank you for sharing all that info, how much take for you to read all that books?
#66daysofdata
hello @ken,  thank you for the video! Would you recommend any book specifically for tennis analytics?
Hey, loved your video. Do you know any books that are related to soccer analytics. Would love to get started with it. Just getting started with this topic. Keep up the good work ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Hello Ken, I am a graduating Sports Management student, I am interested in working in sports research. Where do I start?
Ken, your videos are really helpful.
Can you please recommend a book or any material for analytics in soccer(football) ?
Hey thank you for making these videos! I am reading moneyball and have been doing a lot of research into sports analytics. I came Across your page and found soo much good information and am glad you‚Äôre creating this content to help people get started!
Ken, Looking for someone who has worked on Cricket analysis, Could you recommend??

Would really appreciate your help
Was the art of smart football a good read? I am in search for a good analytical football book!
Hey, I wish to become a sports analyst and I've basic knowledge about programming. Can u guide  me on how to reach my goal starting from scratch?
Ken, love the content brother!  Any chance you know a resource for analyzing running(e.g. marathoning) data?  Also, is that an Oura ring you're wearing?  Thanks!
Oh so happy to have found you üòä
Specific books or tips for cricket analysis?
Are there basic skills, interests or talents you possessed that kind of lead you to say, yeah, I want to make a leap into programming, analytics, data science?  I ask because there are so many people out there including myself that are interested in sports analytics and fascinated by it, but I'm not certain I could actually contribute to the field or am a good fit for it if that makes sense.  I'm currently Junior and Advertising major in college and would appreciate any advice you could pass along! Thank you!
Hi, congrats for this video. Do you know some books about soccer analytics? Thanks
Which book to use if I want to study soccer?
Ok i subscribed
Loving ur channel so far. Sports analytics (basketball) is the reason im getting into data science. I participated in the NBA hackathon last year, making it to second phase. I plan on continuing my studies and go to the hackathon every year. Keep up the great work, loving these type of videos
The article isn't available anymore, could anyone provide any links or something related to it ?
Are they still valid ken
In June I will have a BS in physics. Let's see how well my degree prepared me for learning the brand new field of data!
Thank you.
Good job
Sir I'm from Bangladesh. I am doing bachelor in math. Can I go into data science?
As someone who found data analytics after statistics (and not the other way around), I don't feel intimidated by "maths" in data science, so, sorry, can't relate xD
Good thing I have a bachelors degree in mathematics! But I forgot all this stuff lol. Gotta relearn it all; definitely starting with statistics. I am currently a business analyst with 7 years experience and I really want to be a data scientist.
Thank you very much.
I remember starting with linear algebra for ML....it was a great experience
Hi Ken, 
Intermediate at Python now, I‚Äôm reading Practical Stats for DS by Peter Bruce.

I‚Äôm struggling to understand some basic concepts in stats even though I go through the resources at the end of each topic and Google. Some explanations vary greatly from one source to another. 
Do you recommend I complete the book and practice with projects ASAP, or invest more time in stats 101 etc?
I'm very afraid of math. I spent 13 Years in digital marketing for e-commerce and IT Companies, I dealt with conversion rate optimization and i know basics of SQL, i wrote some web crawlers in Python and I can build interactive dashboards in PowerBI and Google Data Studio but i'm afraid of doing this full time because of math.
I wish i knew what you are talking about xD I am not a native english speaker and i have never learned these things in english. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ So what i love in math is counting percentage and graphs and stuff like that. ü•¥ What i don't love is doing these long {‚àöœÄ=√∑√ó\}√∑(œÄ=[‚àö] -----------) things. üòÇ Told you i don't know how it's in english but you might get my point. ü•¥
Thanks for the vid Ken, it was very informative
Bad news I hated Math in my school days,  Good news I am liking it now because now I am actually implementing it.
Great. See you in 5 years.
#52: The medium link resource is really interesting, thank you for sharing it!
In Math, I have found super helpful the StatQuest YouTube channel, all concepts are digestible and easy to understand!
You both are a good combination of DS knowledge :)

Filipina Chinese. Don't act smart she's naturally smarter. It's much better to approach her like a stupid and illeterate guy who than a cool white guy.
Good luck boy
The girl is in the hallway.
what level of mastery of each would be expected? that's a lot of different things
It seems so complicated. https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer explain the math so good.
The resources provided in Tirthajyoti Sarkar's article are really helpful.... Thanks to him for article and thanks ken for your research...
Is it advisable to do masters on mathematics in data science or data engineering and analytics.Which is the best?
That's so informational, thank you Ken! 
I have a BS in Mathematics. What do you think is better to break in the data science field: a MS in Applied Science or a MS in Data Science?
Am joining uni next year here in morocco and i aim for applied mathematics major ..  u made me really intrested in data science
is it good option to learn statistics  theory before python or both can go hand in hand ???
Can you recommend any good course for calculus? something that starts from the basics?
Great stuff! Just one thing I'd like to start here: As a post graduate in Maths, I'd like to point out that Stats is a separate degree and we math majors don't really study stats and vice versa ( a lot of industry misconception around this). Although stats is basically Mathematics, it's a separate degree. Hopefully this clears doubts, I know a lot of you watching this video would be confused as to pursuing CS or  Math for your MS. Keep this comment in mind, hopefully this finds you.
When you say probability theory, what level are we talking about? Like the "probability theory" class at my school is calculus based and requires us to have taken Multivariable calculus beforehand. Meanwhile I know a lot of concepts in probability theory can be taught to some extent without difficult calculus problems. For example, I just recently ordered a textbook: Probability for the enthusiastic beginner by David J. Morin. It doesn't assume any prior experience with calculus. It covers Combinatorics, Probability, Expectation Values, Distributions, Gaussian Approximations, Correlation, and Regression. Does this sound sufficient?
Do I actually need to be able to solve integrals? I definitely get the calculus concepts in this video, but I just can't reliably solve anything more difficult than the integrals you do in the first 1-2 weeks of Calc 2.
Hey Ken, great vid! I'm planning to specialise in Data Science as a graduate, is learning Python a good place to start? I'm relying on my college to teach me math, but I've got a lot of free time on my hands, so I'm delving into Python. Terrified and excited at the same time :)
What I do is do a project..Use a library for doing what you want..and then go back To see how the library works whats the maths and the research behind it.. Because of this you always Have a example to relate to..
Hey Ken
Is the theory behind ML and DL concepts essential? For example there is a playlist for confusion matrix.So according to you knowing basic concepts is enough or all the theory behind the concepts is also important for a data scientist role?
Hello, I have been following you for a long time and thank you for all the quality content you promote here! I want to develop my mathematical foundations for data science, here's how I thought: I start with the basics of algebra and geometry, then linear algebra, calculus, discrete math, operational research and statistics. What do you think about this planning?
At some point you may come across the Earth mover's distance and other metrics between distribution functions, the Bellman equation (in reinforced learning), wavelets (in data compression and filtering), bootstrap and simulation, Gaussian processes,... fortunately, for the most part, elementary functions will do
hey Ken, did you have to take additional math courses to get into your CS program? if someone works a normal 9-5 job and their CC has affordable online math courses, would you recommend they take stats, discrete, linear, and multivariable calc versus try to learn this stuff on their own?
I'm nearly 33 and have just recently decided to become a data scientist. Is there any hope for someone that was never good (abysmal) at mathematics to get into this field?
Any recommended text books?
I really appreciate you doing this. I am a Physician, but data is the future. Thank. üôèüèæ
Could you recommend some book/s that cover the probablity and statistics needed for data science? Thanks!
Thank you.
Can I, a person with no maths background or base even think of getting into Data Science?
Hey Ken! Amazing video first of all
So I'm a business undergrad student and I've been really interested in analytics for sometime now. I do not have a background in computer science but I'm familiar w a few statistics concepts. I've also started learning python side by side to eventually use it properly.
Do u think I should get these math concepts down before learning more python? Also I know I'm already v late (21) but I just find it fascinating and imo just makes me more employable at the end
tl;dr of the video-

Statistics
-Probability theory
-Descriptive statistics
-Hypothesis testing
-Linear regression


Discrete Mathematics
-Inductive and deductive reasoning
-Graph Theory
-Recursion
-Algorithm Complexity

Linear Algebra
-Matrices and vectors
-Matrix multiplication
-Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Calculus
-Integrals
-Derivatives
-Gradient Descent
These videos are so helpful and have made me truly excited about learning data science
Hypothesis testing is basically all of inferential statistics. Which specific tests are most often used by practicing data scientists?
What sarkar pls come again????
This may seem like a silly question, but how much should I expect to retain in my calculus and statistics knowledge gained from math classes once I am actually working in the field? Should it be expected that I could whip open any calculus textbook and solve a any math problem without having to look at notes? I only ask this because when looking at advanced calculus videos on YouTube, it makes me wonder how I will ever be able to retain all what I've learned, especially when I begin learning differential equations, exterior derivatives, pull-backs, and other advanced topics which as of now seem like a foreign language to me.

Awesome video ken! Thank you for letting us newbies know what to study and understand
Thanks for the sharing.I see the four math area: statistic,discrete math,linear alegbra and calculus required for data science. I graduated with management degree and  cal 1 is the highest math class i had. Is it possible for me to self taught all those math. If yes, what are the resouces you would recommend me to learn from. I wish i study more math back in college but going back to college is not realistic for me now. Thanks again for your time and your sharing in video.
Hey Ken thanks for another informative video. What do you think of the following Coursera specialization called mathematics for data science? https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-data-science#courses
One video on how to build a carrer in data science..
Great Vid. Back to college almost 20 years ago. I don't think I ever tookany course of discrete math. As a chemical engineer, maybe it was elective? Do you think this Coursera's Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization is a good fit?  I don't think this course covers recursion and big O but it covers graph theory.  Or should I take an course specific for algorithm or data structure for Python?
Is it me only or someone who finds that this guy more look like Elon Musk...??
Is taking up online certificate courses in Data science or AI better option and what about the job prospects with an online diploma in data science?
Hi Ken , do you think studying a maths degree while learning cs by my own its a good idea ?
dear Ken, 
I could not open the medium article. It seems that I should have the membership . Is there any other way to share that article ?
Hey Ken video was truly helpful . I am a graduate in management studies (finance), still i am not good with maths, and i'm very much looking forward to learn about data science, how should I start!! kind of confused..
This is exactly what I was looking for... not only a list of all the branches of math needed but a list of elements inside the branches that are most important to learning data science. As a future economics major I love that your career path started with Econ... I hope to do the same. I love computer science but always debated it because I love finance and economics even more good to see there‚Äôs opportunity for Econ majors to really get into data science. Thanks a million!
Is it possible for finance graduate to make career in dat science
Is there any ideal order we should start learning these 4 math concepts? Thanks
Great vid , just wanted to know your opinion of doing a master's in behavioural economics and data science :)
Inspekt labs 
They lowered down the cost to 1$ per claim
Sir I have one suggestion to help the data science community 
You can show real world tech startups use DS/ML/CV to do there business 

I came across this startup they automate insurance claim of vehicles Inspekt labs 


This will help the people have some hope and they can look forward to start something of there own

Thanks man, i was searching for a vid like this
This video was a good summary of things I dont know lol My journey seems to have lenghtened... Thanks.
To be a good data scientist do we need to be good at pure math? A lot of software engineering is logic-based, is it different for DS?
thanks!
Big like
I just want to say that you are doing a great job. You are not BS and you are trying to say something useful and brief. Kudos man, you're great.
So basically I have covered all kinds of math for Data science, great video ‚ù§Ô∏è
I majored in math in college and I studied

- multi var calc
- linear algebra
- probability (discrete, continuous, and multi variable)
- statistics
- numerical methods
- discrete optimization/math of computer algorithms
- discrete mathematics

Lots of other stuff that I doubt is relevant to data science
Nice ! Thank you !!
Hey Ken, all the mathematics stuff you mentioned was in the syllabus of our previous semesters but honestly I don't remember many of the things right now. 
So should I go through all of those topics before enrolling for a course or just start right away?
Ken, this is fantastic! Thank you.
for absolute beginner (with high school math) what do u recommend?? where i should begin ( statistics or discrete math, etc..) ? and can u recommend a source ?
cheers :)
Thank you so much for the knowledge sir! üëçüèªüëçüèª
Great video! I‚Äôm starting a statistical analysis course tomorrow morning üòÅI had discrete math, and algorithms and data structures last year, so I have been looking forward to this course. I was thinking about doing 2 math courses in my electives next year, pure mathematics for programmers and further discrete mathematics :)
I thought you said "I got a B in calculus", then relistened and heard you said "D" :D I was already judging you ;'P
what maths are needed for sports analytics & moneyball?
Im really at the beginning, just started at the Open University, and it was a good overview what to expect.
Thankyou, sir..
Really enjoying your vids, Ken. You could easily just make a bunch of those flashy "salary of a data scientist" or "day in the life of a data scientist" videos that have been beaten into the ground by every other youtuber, but instead you're sharing much more relevant and actionable info. Keep it up!
I am tossing between Statistics or Applied and  Computational Mathematics as my major but I can't seem to figure out which one I should do. I like data analysis and using R but I also like mathematical modelling with differential equations and such. Most of the uncertainty for me comes from not knowing the type of work I would be doing in the real world. Do you have any advice?

PS. Very informative video, first time watching.
Hi Ken , your videos are very informative and keep me motivated on my data science journey. If you can please make more videos on the fundamentals of data science , it would be very helpful. Thank you
thank you sir
100% agreed.
Hi ken Im pursuing a masters in applied statistics and data analytics with an emphasis in biostatistics i find that it might be overkill for doing data science. My original goal was to apply learned knowledge as a biostatisician  but throughout this entire year I've just been more drawn to data science and its business applications and am now leaning towards the business analytics concentration. Nonetheless, super stoked for the future and truly enjoy watching your channel. Only a matter of time until you explode!


p.s. also calculus was the first class I was not able to pass and also recovering from it lol
Great information!!
Thanks for a detailed explanation.
#51: Great video, in the course of the video I was thinking that some of the steps are what some of us do in the process of getting the knowledge and doing projects, so I get to the conclusion that I am almost a Company ü§ì‚úåüèª
Very insightful! Thank you!
#66daysofdata
Nice clear video on the data hierarchy of needs. Great job!
Great video men! You are putting out the real managerial level stuff, just a question. Is there any literature you know where we can validate the pyramid you showed?
Hi  Ken, I'm very interested in Data Science, but I  want to make sure I have my mathematics and statistics down. Care to do a video on types of math and stat classes that I might want to take?
Appreciate the vids man. Love that you incorporate NBA analytics in your channel üëç

Any recommendations for becoming a self taught DS? Taking the DataQuest DS/Python course right now. It's been more hands on than other ones like Coursera which helps me learn better.

Any suggestions to accelerate the journey would be awesome. Thanks man.

Hey Ken, I'm a systems engineer and aspiring Data Scientist in Haiti, trying to incorporate automation and analytics in as many data structures as I can here (as this field is basically non-existent in my country). As your channel is relatively new and growing, I wanted to make a point to say thank you for your time and attention to detail in your videos. They're not only extremely educational and helpful, but have also helped me stay motivated to keep learning in a field where I am alone and have to rely on virtual help from individuals like yourself. Hope this message serves as encouragement to keep going, and to know that your efforts are seen and appreciated across borders. All the best,
Pascal Brun
Thank you!!
Thanks for watching everyone! The link to the mathletics book is located here: https://amzn.to/34k8vfv
Is there a way to do this as a side hustle?
How much do you make in sports analytics.
if you ask an US citicen about the three major sports its baseball, baskettball and football. But if you ask the world its the real football (i mean the sport which is played with the food)
Is git useful to know if one is interested in sports analytics
Hi Ken, thanks for sharing this video. I have background in information technology and computer science, recently I'm also interested in data analytics or data sciences, but I still learning more 'specific things' about its.
Are you have a company in sports analytics or data analytics ?

Hey Ken, I am currently studying Mathematics Education but may switch my major to strictly analytics. Would you reccomend this degree to people looking to enter the sports data field?
Hi Ken i‚Äôve been intrigued by this career for so long but i‚Äôm not quite sure where to start n what you would recommend. I‚Äôm going into my senior year of high school.
Do you have a book recommendation for soccer? Would the concepts of Matheletics translate well into soccer?
Loved it bro
Thanks for the information as I will be looking at this video again many times. I am a tennis teaching professional in my community and much of professional tennis is going to using data to develop their players. Do you have any insight from the ATP/WTA tour
Hey! i have a computer science degree, what route do you recommend i take? Can venmo you or whatever for a quick chat, really want some advice. been working as an SE for 2 years and i‚Äôm over it
I have a project for you. What happened in this play? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oooWI5MHmI8
Hey Ken! I just thought of the perfect job for me last night. Doing something in analytics and bjj if I could find a way to get paid and do both that would be legit! Have you seen analytics and bjj together being used anywhere?
Hey Ken, just came across this video and I‚Äôm super interested in this career. I am currently a MIS major (Management Information Systems) which is basically a split major between computer science and business at my college. What‚Äôs your thoughts on getting this type of job with my major? I understand data analysis is big within this field and I‚Äôd assume sports analytics also, but want to see your thoughts. Thanks!
What are some examples of projects
Do we need to be good in maths for thisb
I am a 16 year old boy but i keep alot of intrest in football and mostly watching them thamk you so much Sir Ken Jee i hope you would help me furthur
What‚Äôre your thoughts on the performance analytics Vs sports analytics? What‚Äôs the career path for each?
hey ken! majoring in econ at the moment, would you say this is a good foundation for sports analytics. Also wondering what minor your would recommend.
I‚Äôm a senior in high school and am interested in doing sports analytics what majors should I look for in a college.
Are there any dominant algorithm(s) that are used in specific sports?  Right now I am doing a project on nba stats and salary using linear regression and K-means algorithms, but are there any algorithms that have been proven more useful for sports?
Any advice for someone wanting to work for a bookmaker? How to price up a sports book? I've started learning about Monte Carol simulation but I feel like i need more sportsbook modling examples
Hey could you help me out? 
I actually wanna do sports management like into Sports Data Analysis so, I am from India do i got a doubt should I go in sports management directly after my 12th boards (ik the grades are different between indian and your country so please try to understand)  or should I do bms then mba in data analysis and then go to Germany for sports management?
I'm currently majoring in computer science, would you recommend a minor in statistics, data analytics, or business analytics
I am in high schooler going into my senior year and I am just wondering what pathway you would say to take to get into sports analytics. Right now I am looking into majoring in sports analytics but am wondering if there is another major people are choosing or something else I am not knowledgeable of.
Hey! Wanted to know if there are such jobs for boxing or ufc?
Hey ken really loved your video. I am currently going to the states this fall and wanting to land a job in sports data science. Do you believe it is mandatory to join grad school if i lack of my resume to get a job right away? Please let me know. Thank you
Hi I am in ireland and have done Sports Analysis from there. Looking for a Job.Any leads? Would be grateful
Hello, I completed my Bachelors Degree in IT from India but I really don't like coding...is there way to get into Sports analytics  without coding or I must do coding. Because I don't want to coding all my life. Sports analytics is interesting. 
What can I pursue if i really hate coding? Note: I got 98/100 in Java in academic course. But I don't like now. Sports analytics intrigued me because it showed me direct application of what I have learnt in my academics...and I am afraid to get into data analytics/science just because it has coding?
How should I start ? Should I really do a formal 1 or 2 years Masters degree or just enroll for online courses? Can you specify some courses to get started?
You look like Roberto Firmino with a glass
The biggest hit in India is IPL Indian Premier League -  the brand value of the last season (2019) was USD 6.7 billion.
Hey Dude, can I please have a short meeting with you, I‚Äôd like to ask you some questions, sports analytics is my dream job
what degree would you recommend?
Hey man I have a few questions.

I'm 16 years old and I'm a diehard baseball fan and have a excellent understanding of the sport. What degrees would you recommend I wanna be someone who works for MLB network or a sports reporter.

2 is it a good career for someone who loves the sport and understands the analytical part of it? Because I feel like I would loveba job like this.

3 is it worth it because people say working for MLB is a very competitive industry and I don't want to make mistakes. 

Thank you for reading hoping to hear soon!
If you read what everybody else has done, and every other coach has read it. What is unique?
Thank you for the guidelines and all the resources üòÄüôå
#50: I have been involved in sports as an athlete & coach, but this is my real goal.
What a gem this video!  I wasn't that aware of the visualization tools, on my list now! 
And I got now the Mathletics book, that I ordered two videos ago, he he :) I'm so happy!!!
Thank you Ken!!!

Sir which are the best universities for sports analytics
Just found this page as I'm beginning my journey to pivot my career.  This is a great starting point.  thank you
Hey Ken! Little late here - but would you recommend SQL for sports analytics?
Hello!! I have two main questions. 
1. Which undergraduate studies are possible to be a sports analyst? 
2. Can you tell the average salary of sports analyst?
Thank you Ken!
If I want to land a NFL job in player analysis?
Which path I should pursue?
If I want to reach the job of something of business and economics in a Football club.
Its okay if I study economics and then I do a master in Performance Analysis?
What do you think?
Is it possible to begin a career in sport analytics with a cis degree?
Can a student pursuing masters in business analytics make career as an sports analyst in football?
would you recommend going to school for being sports analytics?
is data science the only major the would be applicable for sports analytics? i‚Äôm studying applied mathematics and recently have been interested in sports analytics. do you think that would translate?
What should I study for college, I want to be a sports analytics because I love soccer and everyone says follow what you love and that‚Äôs what I love watching soccer I would love to be a analytics on tv analyzing but I also want to be a satician the person who gets stats and spreads the word what should I study
Hey there, I am intersted in becomming a sports analyst or a sports broadcater. I am heavily immersed in sports now, and I am considering in majoring in journalism, mass commuications, public relations, etc. Are there any other majors you recommend? thx :) and happy holidays and stay safe.
Hi Sir , i really love the way you present the content . I am very much interested in your content of sports analytics . Me being a beginner in data science , would like to know if i could land in a job working for any sport team like cricket or football teams if i get into sport analytics.
Thank you , looking out for more videos
Thanks!
Have u by chance heard anything about sports analytic jobs in soccer?

I'm staying in India what are the odds that I land a job who can work remotely offering my work for a sports famous in US
Immortal GMs  Ever 1970-2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nZir7yxyjs
Hi, would you recommend learning data science or data analytics? to start in a sports analytics job?
Hi! Love to watch your content and am really interested in having a career in football analytics or cricket analytics. I am learning data analytics through online courses and planning to get an internship in sports analytics firm. Is that fine or do I need to look for a degree in sports?
Would you recommend doing a university course in this type of area or doing  something like a physics degree and then trying to get into sports analytics
What is/are it's difference with Sports Statistics?
Hi Ken thanks for the video I'm 17 years old and I recently chose to land a sport analytics job. I'm really interested in soccer and basketball.
Is there a related job or activity that I can do at this age?
You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats. Lol.
Hi @ken Jee
Thanks alot for sharing these info., you Just talked about my inquiries exactly. Thanks a lot.
Great piece!!
Hey man, I was actually wondering if I can also write for your medium publication, I'm really passionate about sports and I could work hours on hours observing statistics in the NBA, NHL, ATP tennis, MLB you name it! If I could somehow send you my work to see if you like it, that would be awesome!
Hi ken i m aspiring to be a sports analyst and pursuing a degree in data science 
will my data sci knowledge help me in this feild
You are my man! Let's built a team and predict the next Champions League winner!
Hey Ken! Is programming really important?  I‚Äôm not really good at programming üòÖ
Hey man, am doing master of sports analytics down in Melbourne Australia. Coming from a sports science background definitely took me awhile to learn all the programming stuff, I generally use R in my course btw. But am still try to find a way to step into the sports analytics industry. But if combine knowledge from sports science and sports Analytics is definitely cool. Hahaha
Pursuing this, thanks for the information, enjoying your content
You are giving reply everyone ...good jo bro
2 quick questions... 

1. Where is a good place to learn python efficiently without spending too much money or any at all? 

2. Do you have any suggestions for podcasts about sports analytics (baseball and basketball are what I‚Äôm interested in
I want to do field measurements on athletes.
I would love a channel like what this guy has made but more specialized in Football (European) rather than American Sports
Is there a book about soccer analytics you can recommend?
Hi sir I am a graduate in computer science and I am learning data science, I am an arsenal fan, I want to work for them as a data scientist or a junior data scientist or even an as a trainee. How can I land a job there ?
Have you heard of sports management worldwide?
Do u know how I can be a ball girl or towel girl?
hi! love to see your content I'm from Indonesia and now learning in college about sport especially in football hope someday I can be like youüòÅ
Hello Ken,
I have a technical background but my specialization is Mechanical. Also like every second Indian boy I follow and play cricket alot , I came across your video and gave a thought to explore in this field. Also while pursuing this career I think that choosing your favourite sport would be a good idea. So as I mentioned without having any prior experience in the skillsets, how can I prepare a roadmap for becoming a cricket performance analyst? Will mathletics broaden the generalised view over sports analytics and help in relating to cricket as well to start of as a fresher? I'd really appreciate your feedback on my questions Sir.
Thank you.
Hey Ken, I'd love to pursue a career in sporting analytics but specifically for tennis, since it is my overwhelming passion. Can you speak on how to break into the sporting analytics career for sports that don't have as big of a presence as basketball/football/baseball? I appreciate your time.
Is masters necessary to get a sports analytics job?
Hi Ken, thank you very much for this video! Very informative! I've been exploring data science for a few years now, and I believe I have all the skills necessary (R, Python, SQL, PowerBI, statistics,...). I would love to get into the sports analytics field professionally, but I haven't found the right channels to do that yet. I'm also in the Chicago area, so I was wondering if you have any specific tips to network with people in the sports analytics field? In your experience, what are some of the interesting organizations in the IL area and how would you recommend approaching hiring decision makers?
I've been interested in getting into sports analytics would i be able to do it if i do sports science at university?
Hey ken,

Great work and a eye opener. A tennis coach in Mumbai India . Am total begginer into this .what would you recommend how do I start with? I have no IT background or any tech background. But I believe the data analyst in tennis would work wonders to get know detailed side of the game. 

Thanks
Hi Ken, thank you very much for your help with your wonderful videos. I am 43 years old and have come this far through my fondness for the NBA and fantasy games. I would like to go a little deeper through some courses that I am doing (Mathletics, Python, R, Sabermetrics ...). Do you think it is a waste of time considering that my mathematical education is that of the institute? Thanks again.
I've heard that a great way to eventually end up in a sports position is to work in data for a non-sports business first to legitimize yourself and then transition to sports. Have you seen this and would you recommend?
Thanks for this video ! Very very helpful. I have 8 years of experience working in bioinformatics and dealing with big data from genomics and genetics. I have been looking into transitioning to sports analytics as a new career option . I do have basic data science skills from my bioinformatics work experience but I don't have any specific projects I have done independently in the sports domain. Do you think it would be useful for me to pursue a sports analytics degree before I start looking for opportunities in this domain ? Or would the sports industry still consider me as an eligible candidate based on my programming/machine learning experience while handling big data in the biology domain, even if I don't have real-world experience in sports ?  I do follow several sports enthusiastically such as football, soccer and basketball and I am aware of all the terminologies associated with these sports. I'd really appreciate your feedback. Thanks !
I've just started learning Data science and interested in football analytics a lot ! Should i start with big projects immediately or should I go gradually ? Also it'd be really helpful if you could post a tutorial video of your analysis. And if it's not a trouble, do you mind if i contact you via LinkedIn ? Also can you suggest some online communities to engage with ?
Thank you sir for this video.. Was keen to know about getting into sports analyticsüëç
Hey Ken, weird question but what is the salary like as a Sports Analytics? Im guessing it obviously depends how what rank of Sports field you are in? E.g. NBA, WNBA, NBA G League etc...  Thanks.
I am currently learning machine learning and want to step in cricket analytics part. what all should I start working on to get the right path?
another question I have is  what do u mean by projects what is an example of a project I could do
What would u recommend to me a 16 year old who is absolutely obsessed with baseball analytics and data and is very good with math
Thank you for making and uploading this! Really clear and helpful! 

I am making sport analytics videos on my channel so would love your feedback.
This video helped a bunch! I‚Äôm a high school senior who is torn between my major for next year. I‚Äôm deciding between music and sports business/marketing. I‚Äôm pretty well versed with how the sports world works due to just falling in love with sports in general. Is there any chance I could get your email? I would love to be able to chat about this field!
In really interested in sports analytics or data science as a field. I am only in high school, so what majors would be good to pursue this kind of job? Would you suggest something like statistics or computer science?
Hello Ken, thank you for everything you are making on YouTube. It has been extremely helpful.  I was wondering, could you go more in-depth into what data scientists for NBA teams are currently working on? I have trouble knowing what projects could create value because clubs seem to protect all of their in-house work.
Thank you! Could you be my mentor in Data Analysis field? I would like to communicate with you via stophyuni@gmail.com if you don,t mind. I hope you to send me an email if possible.
Would love to see more videos about sports analytics, specifically in detail basketball(nba), this was very helpful
i love how you reply to every single comment. TOP !
Ken Jee, 
Thank you very much for your detailed explanation. i now have a better understanding of the MSE, RMSE, Cross-Val.
Much Appreciated.
Hi Ken ,  understanding it as you talk . keep talking . üòÄ
Anyone, Would you like to suggest any dataset different than the vehicle on which I can try out these operations?
Hey, the present dataset on Kaggle has some changes in it so is it a good thing? I replicated this regression and I have gained much from it.

This playlist is really promoting me to explore more and more... As I am getting many questions, which is really good for growth

As always thank you very much for the video...
#49: My DS journey started exploring Machine Learning and later on the EDA and Data, not sure if was the right path  - ‚ÄúLife is a continuous exercise in creative problem solving‚Äù right? - but this video just made me happy. I actually know something! Yay!!!
#66daysofdata
Thanks for this video. Started using SPYDER IDE, liking it over VS Studio and Jupyter Lab. VS had issues with the Jup extension, not plotting the null heatmap with 400k rows. When comparing to your current videos (late 2020), your content presentation has improved DRASTICALLY. Thanks again!
Thanks for making these videos! I know its niche, but it's extremely helpful!
Hi Ken, this is so helpful...but I do not get why does the constant appear on my co-relation plot!
Hi there Ken! As always, your video is really helpful for someone who just started learning about data science, in the line 41 and 42, why would you apply the lower/upper change only to data.desc.head instead of data.head? Thanks for the informative video, I learned a lot from it!!
Hi Ken! Your videos are tremendously helpful. Thank you. I need some direction please. I was trying to replicate your  steps here. 
When I ran  : 'scores = cross_val_score(reg4,x4,y4, cv=5, scoring= 'neg_mean-squared-error')'. Here was the bug I got:

ValueError: 'neg_mean-squared-error' is not a valid scoring value. Use sorted(sklearn.metrics.SCORERS.keys()) to get valid 
options.

Could you assist please
Wow, a very detailed lesson on single and multi regression with cross-validation. regarding your comment to have the actual selling price information, is it for error computation or for model fitting? will there be leakage if use in model fitting? thanks.
Hi Ken,
At the cross validation part, why didn't you check for the R^2 for the 5 different tests too?
Thanks for the video!
Another query. Why do we have to set the variables like odometer and price into specific format or  scale them?
So first we perform data manipulation and cleaning which you taught in the previous videos before linear regression right ?
Hi Ken, 
at 8:58, the boxplots of the  price and odometer look the same after removing the outliers. 
I am quite confused. Could you explain a little further? 

Thanks
I just found out my last assessment for the year is going to be a Regression Analysis,  so this may come in handy :)
Sir Ken, what IDE are you using? Seems better than Jupyter.
üêº Panda love to see that import statementüòçüòç....video was a treat to watch ...
In this video I am able to understand the analysis but as I'm anaware about golf so it was little confusing for meüòÅ but analysis is good like which parameters to consider so that we can try to perform similar action for analysing another sports dataüôå
#48: Ok, you love golf.
And, this is what I meant with the Basketball video. It's much better to understand the idea (Not a Golf fan here he he) 
About the factors, you read them in a book, or was it because of your expertise in Golf? (Not being an average golfer,  course conditions)
Great analysis!!!!!
#66daysofdata
As always Ken...great video.
Over the course of a long tournament, there is a mental benefit of hitting fairways.  But maybe longer hitters are psychologically able to respond to chaos better
This is a great analysis!  It highlights in many ways the value of a caddy and the strategy that goes into every shot.  I imagine that players get printouts of each hole at a tournament and can gauge what risks are worth taking and which spots on the course that should be avoided at all costs.
Ken - do I take my new Pythagorean expected win % and multiply times 162? Or - it‚Äôs Aug ‚Äò22 and Dodgers have played 106 with 56 to go‚Ä¶ do I apply Pythagorean % to 56 left and add to actual wins in first 106 in books?  Love your stuff
Great video, thks!!!
Great video! Where could I find data that includes runs scored and against?
Great video!! Can we apply something similar to golf if we want to know the probability of a player winning another player in a tournament?
#48: Is that the Tommy Hilfiger Olympics hoodie?
Well, this video is a gem, I already order the books suggested, I hope to solve a lot of questions that I have :) 
And as my friend Arvin here, I hope to get back and say thank you, again!
#66daysofdata
How do we project Soccer games? Please help!
Can you do a video for soccer?
In college for our baseball team, I found that taking the R, RA and applying the Pathagorean Theorem taking the power of 1.5 instead of 2 was more accurately predictive of college baseball programs when using a linear best fit.
I had to stop the video and try this out myself. I went back and found this clip in moneyball. Just ran all the numbers for the MLB 2019 season. This is wild! My hometown team the TB Rays with 769runs and 739 against with 84 projected wins ended up with 96. Got to win the close games! 2nd largest difference behind Chi White sox, who had a winning percentage despite having 708 for and 832 against. This is so cool and I really appreciate that you take the time to upload content like this!
cool i'm getting to know your channel now, i'm having difficulty i use google sheets to do my basketball projections but when i play game results into the spreadsheet it is only upright do you know how to change that ???
Thank you for your clip! Could you also make a sample demo for regression or classification using the data of MLB(baseball) or FIFA(soccer)?
The field of data science will soon take over not only sports but even the health and fitness industry.  Looks like my decision to pursue a masters degree in this field may pay off.

There's a high pitched sound like a ringing in the background of your video. A concise video, thanks!
Really helpful! Thanks!
Thank you from Morocco keep going Broo
How is data scientist in india
Thanks Ken!
The best way to make money with data science  is to find an area of activity or industry or obscure market that can benefit from optimization with ML models.
Thank you sir, it's very helpful and motivate me
This is fastest growing channel on youtube dedicated to DS. Great job!
Thanks for sharing mate, this was a great vid.
You makes DS interesting.. )))
great video, thanks man :)

have done 1 and 9 so far (Kaggle + YouTube channel) - am gonna play around with the other suggestions
As a person in last year of school i found out recently about data science unlike artificial intelligence or programming i coudnt seem to under what data science does can u please link any articles which might intrest a student trying to pursue engineering
Sir you can thoroughly give example like a case study of cool data science products.
Those guys who made products would have insights about there journey and selling there service.
Dude, i like ur videos. Improvement hint: add keyword text to ur videos, it gets better to understand
As always nice content and selfless guidance to enable more and more people in their skill set. Thanks Ken
This is my first year as a data scientist student, i will watch all your videos, wish me good luck :)
I like it!
have you used deep learning/neural network techniques in your projects?
Hello ken,  What kind of algorithms one should know for the data science coding interview?
Thank you for sharing~

This analysis and the growth of my channel would not be possible without you watching. Thank you again for staying tuned!
Nice video! maybe you could do this analysis every semester and show us the highlights to celebrate! I think it would be great for new years eve jaja. Greetings from Peru!
#45: Wonderful insights, it's great following you along with all this. I saw your 45 videos till today, and I think the sweet spot in the length of the videos is 12 min and is nice that all videos are specific and clear (Nothing with data here :) just my personal point of view )
Thank you for sharing the code, for me has been a good way to understand some of the blurry concepts in my mind!!!
#66daysofdata
Interesting analysis! 

Another factor to consider is the content of the videos themselves. Your videos cover various topics like data science as a study / career path, project demos (like this one), and work / life suggestions. So, is there a coloration between the content of the videos (factoring in some of the other influences) and the response metrics? 

And while you are taking into consideration which days you post videos, have you considered simply posting on a particular day routinely? Lastly, are you LOSING subscribers and are there any suggestions, if this is occurring, as why this is happening? 

Keep up the good work!! Looking forward to a follow-up video (if I just haven't gotten to it yet).
Solid analysis! I wanted to do a similar video like this but don't have enough data to work with yet. Thanks for the tips on post time, I wonder if posting on Monday is unique to your channel or it applies to other channels as well?
Great, that's really data science brought lively and friendly. Am inspired, and am glad too the channel is growing well
I was thinking as the video went on that you should do another video. It's been almost a year and a comparison would be pretty good. But if you did it live? Then we'd get to see how you would apply data analysis to your YouTube channel. I bet you'd have some really good numbers to report on with pretty steady growth :)
please make a video on best projects to attract recruiters post covid 19
Thanks Ken for an insightful video! LIked your analysis, particularly your results on posting consistently led to increased viewership and watch time where Days of Posts & Days After Posts had  2-5 times higher viewership and 2-3 times higher watch time.
Hi Keen, I really enjoy your videos, do you think is a good idea to start the first project making one model of linear multiple regression or it should be a bit more complicated? Thank you
Interesting video! I'm a Junior Undergrad majoring in CS and I love Data Science videos like yours! Thanks!
Nice job Ken Boss! So sick to see your own analysis on the youtube data. Well done!
Please do a follow-up video explaining the effects(+ve or -ve) of you findings on your channel( did your channel actually grow )
After publishing the video, it appears that I left out an extremely important part of selling! You need to understand your customer and make sure that you are providing an analysis that is relevant to their end goals. If you are speaking to business stakeholders, they are usually focused on profit / loss, user experience, or other performance metrics. Make sure that you are tying the value of your work to these metrics that are important to them. Thanks again for watching!
Great content! I‚Äôd like to add to ‚Äúgetting the yes‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs just as important to get a ‚Äòno‚Äô or an objection early on that way you can discover info that would otherwise be a hidden roadblock further in the sales journey.
Ken, The technique mirroring is really effective. I am very much influenced by it till now in my life. I was unaware to it. 

It may sound weird but I am trying to avoid watching movies and the content which is not relevant for my growth because it unknowingly makes a huge impact on my day-to-day routine. I am watching more videos of you and more data science videos so that I can cultivate those hobbies in my life. 

This is really a great and best video for me.
#44: True,  not only as a DS skill, but I think also a life skill. Not easy to get, it's important to cultivate it. ‚≠êÔ∏èüë©üèª‚Äçüíª I made a course on that topic and was really useful, not only to understand me as a "seller" also to understand the client and how to sell, all about personalities!! Great tips Ken!
#66daysofdata.
Thanks Ken! This was very informative.
Thank you for sharing!!
I do not think the 3 point should be move and I think dunks and anything really close should be lowered to 1 point
I believe there should be a 4 point and 5 point shot, the 5 point would be half court and the 4 would be halfway between the 3 and 5
26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.
#43: When I see this kind of video (Like the 2 or 3 points or shot) could be nice having more animation background because it's really interesting, the average person (who understands Basketball and no knowledge of DS) could be awed by a little more ... I think.
Anyways, it's a great video. üôåüèª
#66daysofdata
Technically speaking, shouldn‚Äôt the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 3:55? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I‚Äôm assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)
Have you ever played around with any Fantasy basketball or fantasy football analysis/prediction?
What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded. It might be worth a try. Haven't read that elsewhere as of yet.
nice to see some truly novel analysis outside of the millions of "predicting handwritten digits from mnist" videos
I thought for sure I could be the annoying guy that said you forgot about how the 4 pt shot helps the value of a 3 pt shot.  I was wrong!  great video as usual.  Love the way you break this stuff down and cover the shortfalls at the end.  I think there are quite  a few things the NBA should look into before this, most importantly scheduling.
You are 100 % Right.  I have myself have taken a break  after whole 3 years of continuous working without any long vacation. It really affected my physical and mental health.
#42: What a topic!
It's really lovely how you are not only interested in showing his DS point of view and knowledge, you also care about the importance to feel happy & find balance in life. üôåüèªüôåüèª
You go beyond and that's great! #66daysofdata
How beautiful it is to work long and hard and alone on a project but also be able to present it and explain it to others, AND add real value and impact to the user. 
Thank you
One thing that helps with the sedentary part of the data science job (or any computer heavy job) is a treadmill desk. You don't need anything fancy: just a cheap treadmill, a shelf from a hardware store or an old bookcase, a couple of bungee cords, and voila: a home-made treadmill desk. üòÅ
Yeah G! Hope you have a good trip. Also save some of that PTO for some Utah shred time! ;)
Well said Ken. Enjoy Hawaii!
Nu hg
This will always be my fav top
thanks for this video. I have started learning data science and sometimes i needed motivation for keep going.  I will come back here when I will get job in data science.
Hey Ken. I like the Excel spreadsheet you had up there for time management/tracking. Do you have a link to view it on Google sheets or something like that?
I want to become data scientist I don't know why I choosen it as my goal , dream . But I confirmed that I want to become data scientist . Now I'm in 12 th plz tell me the right path how can I make it unique ? 

I have just fair that what really I will become a data scientist ? üòü Just depressed ‚òπÔ∏è
Isn't it a bit stressful having to fill such a giant spreadsheet after completing every task?
Thank you so much for this. I've been losing motivation and dedication while on this journey. It's hard to continue at times.
Would you be willing to share your spreadsheet so that we can download it?
Thanks for motivation and valuable tips Ken, I was in great need of that. Thanks.
#41: I must say about the schedule, the day that I started to do it when I heard it from you in one of your videos, it's mindblowing how true and clear it is the time that I have vs. the time I think I have, thank you for that one, really!
And about your track sheet, oh my! Now on I will call you my Mentor, I hope you don't mind, je je  üôåüèª
#66daysofdata
How is the motivation scorecard used? How do you "motivate" yourself to keep track of so many tasks / goals particularly without the task of tracking interfering with achieving the tasks / goals? Do you utilize any methods to capture the data at  the source of the activities (e.g.; fitness tracker)?
Thank you for 5 tips and for sharing your spreadsheet.  Your Data Science Beginners playlist is helping me to explore more about data science........
Thank you it's very helpful !!
I am so much thank ful to you bro. I'm currently down and overwhelmed about this I've been learning about 3 months without a break and still I know nothing when I read source code form others kaggle note book and I'm so depressed. Sigh.. life long learning
This is so good to hear. I'm trying to learn data science skills these days and for the past couple of days I've been feeling low. But ill be back on track soon. Thanks for the video Ken. Its pretty motivational !!
Hey Ken!¬†Thanks for the tips; I‚Äôm steadily habituating many of these practices, and with greater intention after watching the video. 

Question: what are you using that small whiteboard on your desk for? I have a similar one that I‚Äôm trying to determine a purpose for. . .
Thank you for the tips Ken! I especially agree with the "starting small" part. In the past, I used to just consume most of my daily time to that new habit during the initial phase. I would just see starting small as being "not good enough". However, I realized that this was causing me to have burnouts frequently. So even though changing your "bad habits" is hard, I am trying to apply this advice and I can already see its benefits.
These tips are something that most don't bother about, neither about learning them, nor teaching them to people, thank for the initiatives.
Thank u!
Great video Ken!!!
I will surely implement these tips .
Thanks for making this video Ken. Really inspiring me to keep learning data science
Thank you for this, Ken! 
Great book references üî•
Great video! Thanks Ken üëè
Ken, great video. Can you post that spreadsheet to github? 


I come from a non technical background. My major is supply chain management with a minor in information systems. I took a data science course and did well in it. The course mainly covered more advanced statistical concepts, not so much of programming (I lack in computer skills the most). I really enjoyed the course. I currently work as a business analyst. I am considering taking your advice to get a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan. Thanks for the information you provide on this channel!
üî•
Appreciated Ken!
The three-point line should be about 100 feet away from the rim
what application do you use to make the graphs and analysis
How to get data for doing analytics? For eg. On Japanese national football team
What this tells me is that shots made from the paint should be worth 1 pt.
Get rid of it all together I say!
It's obvious to many that the current 3pt line is not far enough from the rim but it's fascinating to see that there's data backing it up and to pinpoint to where the ideal distance is, super fascinating work! It's no wonder that more and more teams such as the Utah Jazz are trying to eliminate the mid-range 2's entirely and replace those with 3's instead, but it's also interesting to see players like CP3 does not shy away from the mid-range 2's in the clutch (and has the full freedom to do so) likely backed by their individual statistics that is way above the league average thus making it a worthwhile shot.
I was really anaware about the points system in basketball üèÄ it's really good analysis...

One thing is sure that players need to be focused on  from where they are throwing a basketball towards the hoop üòÄ It makes the game challenging and may increase customer engagement...
#40: Inspirational project video here!
When I watched the graphs, and then the Steph Curry one, I thought about the sweet spot on finding insights from the best players to transfer that to coaches who train new talents. 
Somehow the data can lead to something. I'm positive about that!
#66daysofdata
Technically speaking, shouldn‚Äôt the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 1:59? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I‚Äôm assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)
Most players are starting to shoot deeper threes anyway so I don't think moving the line back a foot and a half will do that much. I could be wrong tho.
As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.
Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.


The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix.
#GoodTalk
Love the analysis, thought it was super interesting! Thought of another question as I am working toward switch fields to data science. What types of things would you want to see on a resume/CV with no formal data science background besides data science projects, and github?
Love this video and this kind of content.  I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect.  Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out.  Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further.  I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this.  I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt.
That Steph graph was kinda surprising
Wow, is this a coincidence? I just talked with one of my group members about 4 pointers in Big3 league and other stuff relating to sports data analysis this afternoon. Just as I arrived at home a couple mins ago, I turned on my computer and saw this fresh new video which talks about NBA 3-point line. So I immediately commented before watching.
Thanks for great advise.  I will start working on my projects in next month. One question : Would you choose Tableau or Power BI for Project Dashboard ?
I am thinking to become Data Scientist and good with maths. I am severely deaf and can cope  1 to 1 communication using lip reading and able to speak clearly. I am concern about my communication difficulties in meetings and undergo presentations but however in the UK unfortunately there are shortage of Sign Language Interpreter (SLI). It be good idea to set up meetings early something like 8.00 am or late after 5.00 pm because that when SLI are usually available. I like to know how often do regular Data Scientist need to attend meeting during the day, how long and is it everyday? I understand being a typical software engineer for example that the meeting are normally 1/2 an hour meeting per day.
#39: Great advice here. 
Being creative, network and have good communication with end-users is a big thing in Computer Science, BIG!!!

hi this year I'm going to finish school and I have to chose a career so which career would u think which is better ? (IT, statist or business)
thank u
After long time. !!  
 Was waiting for your new video..
The 7th habit is using the whiteboard which doesn't have to be too big. Good stuff to do mind-mapping before getting into daily work. üòÑ
If the website is protected by Cloudflare, it may be quite difficult to scrape the website using these methods.
Thank you so much for sharing!
Needed to add nltk.download('stopwords')  to get it to run.    :-/
#38: Seriously,  following the order of the videos has brought me a lot of light in the process.
WHAT A GREAT PROJECT HERE!!
Easy to follow and understand, a lot of ideas came to my mind!! Thank you Ken!!!!!!
#66daysofdata
Great job. I like seeing the project end-to-end. üòä
I have avoided web scraping because I'm still unclear on when it's OK to do it and when it's not (and I'm the kind of person who avoids at all costs doing something that might get me in trouble. üòÅ) I've read quite a few robots.txt files and many of them specifically disallow crawlers other than the usual search engines, yet some people feel comfortable scraping those sites. 


Do you have any guidelines for deciding when it is OK to scrape and when it isn't?
I just found this gem! It is really cool to see you were at a 1000 subs at one point as well. It is also nice to see you have kept to your video topics. Well done Ken üí™ Going to watch the 10,000 subs video now... üòÅ
#37: 37 videos till this one!!! (I didn't see the interview one - Tim Bowling)
I think this one boosts your ideas and your YouTube channel starts taking shape.
Has been an inspiring and great journey watching your videos ü§ìüôåüèª #66daysofdata
Thank you Ken
Hi Ken, thank you for creating the channel. i like all your videos, especially the fundamental ones as i can follow and utilize it to analyse other datasets from Kaggle and hopefully create my own projects as my package for Business Intelligence type of role interview. (as I'm an MBA student worked years in marketing.)
I watched every video of this channel more than 3 times. Seriously!
Hi Ken,
I am an Industrial Engineering graduate student with a keen interest in data and supply chain.

Can you tell me something about how the scope will be like if I enter into the field of data as I am bit ambiguous in which area do I need to do research or project?
Hi Kan,
Could you make a video tutorial on Feature engineering?. Not the basic fiillna(), one hot encoding etc. I mean some advanced feature engineering techniques(like X=x/y etc). It will be much helpful for people like me. Thanks and have a good day
Hey man, congratulations on the milestone!  I'm so proud of you. Can you make a data science 101 course ? that would be really helpful :)
hey man! congrats on the milestone! I think main request would be projects start to finish. big or small doesn't matter. I just think there's plenty of theoretical content out there (books, videos, etc) but building helps to solidify learning! As a new ML student, that's what i'd love to see
Congrats Ken!! Definitely deserve more!
Wish  1000000
üí•Congratulations üí•on 1küí™ subscribers.
Still many to come.
N yeah your contents have definitely helped me .thank you n keep it up.üëç
Your videos encouraged me to opt for Data Science in my university. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
You deserve it.
Hey Ken, 
Thanks for the useful video, I am very interested in learning data science,  but I am not sure if I can pursue it because I have got like 0 knowledge about it , could you help? 
Love from India
Waaaay better than how my college has explained so many computer science fields!! THANK YOU!!!
i kinda find it cool, but too intense.
I did a bachelors in law, then did a bachelors in business informatics. 
I did so much better in my informatics degree but the it was the most taxing and I would shut down and literally quit school a couple of days after projects and exams. I was quite a slow learner, despite my 3.7 gpa.
Im just looking for a career that pays a lot where the skills required are not so broad.
I feel like accounting could have done the trick.
Im about to do an internship as a data analyst, im honestly still not sure about this path and I dont know many ppl as clueless as I am about their interests, after investing so much time in education. Any advice?
Hi Ken,
I am an Computer Engineer and have a bachelor's degree on the same field. Furthermore, I am thinking of pursuing my further Studies in Data Science and I am currently working as a .NET developer(love to code). I found Math, Probability & Statistics interesting during my semesters over the years. So I think it would be good for me to practice with Data Science right? I'd like some of your feedbacks & btw awesome video :)
sexy field accompanied by sexy hardwerk and sexy youtubers
Hey I got a question would you say that data analytics and data science are similar or way to opposite ?
#36: I am involved in CS long ago, and this new path of Data Science is really interesting.
The hardest question for me has become the opportunity to actually, get the job or the internship not being a recent graduate. Let's see if I can solve that question! 
By the way, as always, great video! #66daysofdata
Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my  current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take ‚Äúhonors‚Äù or ‚Äúhigher‚Äù courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions? 

Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses? 


Thank you as always and rly hope that you can give me some insights on these.
Hi Ken,am from India,  I have completed my engineering from electronics branch.but now am doing 6 month course on data science.how long will it  take  for a person to land as a data scientist
You have a good series of videos here... The best part is you are properly guiding us whether one should go ahead with it or not. This is self analysis which is very important and this is what I leaned through this video...
My biggest hurtle seems to be the degree.  TL;DR - Due to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I effectively can no longer get a Bachelor‚Äôs in the U.S. (without first having tens of thousands, and at that point I could transfer my first 109 credits), so I‚Äôve been learning a lot of the math on the side.  Programming I‚Äôve been doing since I was a child, but I‚Äôve still a lot to learn to become a data scientist in other aspects.  Anyone who may know, I‚Äôm intrigued, in your experience, approximately what percentage of data scientists do you know who hold no degree?  I imagine not a lot.  But then again, I‚Äôd finish my degree if I could, too.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello sir, 
I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science. I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing, parallel computing, algorithm engineering, mathematics models for optimization problems. I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml.
Hey , man great insight,  I'm a brand new student and 2 years away from getting my batchelor in data science  at city tech my only fear is that I won't get a job because my school is not prestigious. Is this a real issue?
Hey ken, been following you for a while, been studying data science online and wanted to get a complete textbook with all the info, anything you can suggest?
I have a major in electronics , so maths required for data science is not an issue for me . Can you guide me about other skills I should learn and how to get DS job as fresher
How much time it takes to become an industry ready data scientist?
Hello sir I am Akash from india currently doing my graduation in science. Once I get to know about field of data science, after that I am just researching about this field. Now I made my mind to draw my career in data science.
So please assist me.regarding me about the scope of this field. How can I be successful in this field?
Bro I have a doubt. I am interested in CV and NLP but not interested in linear regression kinda stuff. Can I learn CV and NLP from the beginning itself?
This is incredible. Thanks
Hi Ken. Is data engineering realted to data science? Can u suggest learning path for it please?
What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science?
Thanks so much more for the video.. Actually I have interest in Data Science and i have just gotten admission for my Msc in Data Analytics but i do not have any basic knowledge in Machine language, programming and all the necessary things needed to make the course easier for me, and i am really interested in this course, please, what do i do to meet up with the standard of the course and also to finally achieve my purpose in choosing this course?
Hi Ken,
I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I‚Äôm getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don‚Äôt remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they‚Äôre open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.
  Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?
You are the hottest data scientist!
Sir your glasses looks good
Hi Ken, Firstly thx for video. I am a psychology student from turkey and I intersted this field (DS). We study on SPSS program and study some statistics topics on our department. Can you what recommend for me to me for go my DS way.
My backrond is enough for this field? if your answer no; what I have to do? I wanna growe up myself for Ds by self learning. Now, I am study Python and then I will learning R, ML and AI.
New here
Thank you Mr.Ken jee
Wow
He is so hot and that's why he's on daily creater ü§§
Hi
Very nice Aman
Hi ,  i have a masters degree in Marketing(major) and i had 1 year experience in sales.I wanted to switch my carrier to Data science. will the degree&experience help me in my carrier transition to Data science??
Sir. .any mast degree is required for data scientist ..?
For none CS majors, what are the top cs topics that once need to master to be successful in data science ? What are some good resources?
I found you from another YT channel you just commented on today. I am thinking about taking a certification course in Data Science from eCornell. What is the best program in NYC would you suggest?
Sir, This is prajwal & graduated with   bachelors in mechanical engineering in the year 2018, who has 1 year  of  work experience in procurement & Business Development & I have got a offer for M.tech in Data Science & Engineering.


Is it advisable to accept this offer as I have don't have any knowledge on any programming languages with a basic knowledge on coding in C programming. 
  

Kindly guide me in accepting this offer or to reject this as i suppose I may find it difficult during the tenure of this course.


Waiting for your reply.
Nice piece of advice Ken. Good job üëçüëè
How do you develop your skills in calculus? I never took calculus in high school, and I'm barely in my first year of college.
Hey Ken, I've got a Data Science Internship interview this week and am very excited (and nervous as hell) to get my foot in the door. Thanks so much for these videos, they're honestly gold!
Yes, data science is right for me in probably more ways than the number of roommates I've had the last 7 years, which is too many! lol  However, like you said in one of your comments below, getting into the field ASAP through being a data analyst would probably be a better bet for someone in my situation who is severely underemployed, has loads of debt, and wants to have a better quality of life. In all honesty, I would be quite content with a data analyst role. I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life. I see becoming a data scientist with an emphasis on big data engineering or machine learning engineering as long term goals and becoming a data analyst as more of a short term goal (18-24 months), with luck and or strategic networking maybe 12-15 months.
Your advice is spot on:
 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. üòÅ)
 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem. Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving. Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist. üòâ
 3. learn the math (I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but, most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them. When done right, I can't see how anyone can not love math.)
4. learn coding
5. tell great stories


Also, a quote I heard recently, makes a nice addition: "For some, data science is an opportunity. For me, data science is a passion." üòä When you go into the field for the right reasons, you'll do whatever it takes to get great at it.


I enjoyed watching this video. Keep up the great work.
Hey Ken,  
I've opted for Data Science as my majors in my university, but I've a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Can you explain how data science can help me work in AI and ML?
Good to see you
Good content!!
Keep it upü§ì,
Hey Ken,  I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. 


If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.


What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.

great vid btw!
great session !!!!!  request from my side is can make a video on the basic of  sklearn
Nice content, easy to understand and packed with useful details that I'm going to be able to put to work. Thank you so much for contributing your time in showing us all. Great stuff.
This is a good basis to show video. I learned step by step data cleansing method applied by KJ and created my Data Cleansing Framework via it. Thanks man! Awesome! From Faizal, Malaysia
Good tutorial Ken, very clear, thx a lot!
Appreciate you!
Got the first look of sklearn.preprocessing , After this video I will read documentation for all these MinMaxScaler, fit_transform, transform etc. Thanks for another knowledge filled video.
Thank you, Ken... This is a really good and interesting playlist. I am learning much about the various operations and commands through this playlist.
These longer coding videos are fire, thanks
#35: Useful if you did your first projects on Data Cleaning, and want feedback on what you did vs. what is common to do. For me, some concepts click! Thanks Ken!!!! #66daysofdata
15:49 - A simplier way to go would be: df.description.apply(lambda x: str(x).lower() )
Hi Ken, great content as usual! Thank you so much it helps me  a lot!
Learned some great cleaning skills on datasets. thanks
Hey Ken ! Great video.

I had confusion about the code for scaling the data. Can you explain me how exactly does it work ?
Thank you Ken. This really helps
Hi Ken, thank you for your great content.
 so I am new to data science here, data exploration and data cleaning are where I've stuck for a while now. Is there any book or resources explain things step by step.
One more thing is I've understood your code but I don't get the meaning behind especially
the scaling data.
Maybe it was an update, but the function .desc didn't work here. I had to type .description
thankyou, this is very helpful, also could you make a video on data visualization :)
Really great Ken, thx :)
Hi Ken, thanks for making these tutorial videos, they are very detailed, informative and helpful!! Thanks for your efforts.  A quick question. In around 21-22minutes, you use : data.cylinders=pd.to_numeric(data.cylinders,errors="coerce"). I do not really understand what does this function do, can you explain it? Thanks
I wonder why u had to use a CSV file of 1.4G size. Really?
18:48 - why would you apply tolower again? (Wasn't it already done for the whole data frame?)
19:37 - what's the use of doing data.cylinders = data....
Hey Ken these videos are really great. It's nice that I'm able to follow almost everything you're doing already. One question is, I know these videos are Fundamentals of Data Science, but how much farther does your day to day Data Science job go from here?
Great! Thanks
Love it. This is just exactly what i need. Thank you so much !!! 

Hope your channel will have many viewers .
thanks
Liked your video.. again..
Thank u for ur efforts. 
Really appreciate it. üëç
appreciate the detailed step by step tutorial! one concern though, for the cylinder column, would it make sense to fill na with the mean cylinder values?
A few things I omitted are Hackathons and Kaggle competitions. These are both great ways to earn experience as well!
why all data science roles ask for masters?
1) Campus Research Opportunities
2) Personal Projects - some kind of real world feedback. Share them online
3) School Work - articulate it very well 
4) Internship
5) Freelance
6) Free work for a real client like a social organization
I needed this a LOT! Thanks Ken
Great video Ken! I think working on open source projects can be a really good idea too to gain experience.
Thank you!
Hey ken all your video are very helpful for beginner data S like me. You have the correct words in place to motivate people. I live in Canada and I want you to suggest to me what kind of free service, data Scientist can propose to a small business. 
Thank
I am definitely going with that charity data analysis thing. Here in India most of the NGOs collect data but that data seems to be of no use as there will be no analysis by them.  I would like to get my hands of that data and help them to improve their social welfare services. Thanks for the great idea Ken.
#34: I didn't know about the freelancing place (Upwork), I take a look, and seems interesting.
About the non-profits what do you recommend is a good way to find them?
Great video, as always!! #66daysofdata
Thanks for sharing..... Working for free at the initial level is the best way to prove our work...
Helpful
I see real value and useful tips in all your videos. You go straight to the point and come across as a credible person. I wish you more success and happiness. Thank you!
sir are data structure and algorithm asked in data science jobs?
I am having a master in Computational and Data Science. I have a lot of subjects like scientific computing, parallel computing, algorithm engineering. Can you please tell me how important are these subjects in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning since i want to deep into those areas.
I'm a data analyst freelancer hope to connect with data analysts
Pro tip: just play this video at 1.5 play speed, thank me later!
Hello Ken, thanks for motivating. Could you please help how to put into working model for free at a non-profit organization? I find it hard to find a partner to work on personal project. Any tips and tricks would really help me.
Thank you for your advices!
Hi, Ken! Thanks for video!
I agree with you about free work. Any ideas how to find such companies?
hi could you rank the multiple way you get the data science experience?
Thanks
Hi,
I just completed way college degree four months ago, did data science course with getsmarter.

Now my question is, on my LinkedIn profile should what words should I use as head (should I put data scientist for recruiters to find me or just write a graduate).

I don't know. Plz help.

Cheers.
Great advice!
informative contents 
keep goin bro !
Hi
Is it possible to get entry level data analytics job without a degree??  I am a 32 year old college student  driving for uber  in LA. I hate my life right now lol

@Ken Lee I've just discovered your channel. You're doing a very nice job with your videos (a balance of practical tips and encouraging advice.) Keep up the great work. üòä
I'm new to data science and this is a great tip to look forward to!
hey ken, just found your channel. as someone who is aspiring make a career change towards data science, your videos have a lot of helpful content for a beginner like me. thanks and as always keep up the good work!
Hey ken! 
I just completed my graduation and
I am currently doing data science course from a local reputated institute.
Our exposure to actual real world work is v minimum. So some advice from a person like you will mean a lott.
Thanks Ken
Hey Ken, thanks for another great video! 
I have a question regarding working for a non-profit or a small company though. Do you literally knock on their door and ask if you could apply your skills to their project? I was thinking of doing this as an option if I don't get an internship before I graduate.
Do you sleep?  Keep churning out this quality content ken!
Hey Ken, I heard that one needs to have an advanced degree or a lot of knowledge in calculus and statistics in order to get a job in data science. I‚Äôm interested in getting into data science and big data but am not sure about having the ‚Äúrequired‚Äù formal education with advanced mathematics. Thanks!
#33: As always, great video and consistent idea on how to work on a great project.
"Solve problems that add purpose to your project" that's a great one üôåüèª

Thank you so much for this very informative video. 
We need to think out of the box üì¶ 
Thanks again.
You are a beast
Your videos are full of sense, really appreciate it.
Thank you for your videos! Super helpful and realistic, no artificial stuff. Love it!
hello Ken
Thanks for watching everyone! I would love to hear about the projects you are working on in the comments section below!
it is difficult to concentrate with the background music, although your content is good :)
Handsome man
How would one categorize a project of something like "an algorithm to find an optimum point/value (either max or min) for a set of possible configurations" (for example a TSP-ish problem)...? Given that the problem requires that one understands the data from those configurations and the business value a solution would provide.
1.5 years ago I was just starting my sophomore year of undergrad, and I didn‚Äôt even understand half of what you said here lol. Now I‚Äôm at the end of my junior year and I feel like I could have a good conversation about this stuff. Feels good to grow!
As a beginner, I'm extremely thankful for you. Your videos are super informative.
Hey man, Great page! 
I graduated with a degree in actuarial science.
While I was fortunate to learn the rigorous of Linear Modeling, coding and finance in general, It did not prepare me with the skills to market my skills to employers.I think your doing great work here. Thank you!
I work at a market research firm as an analytics client manager. I create many deliverables from our proprietary research/data, but I don‚Äôt know if I can share those publicly given NDAs. I‚Äôm not looking to leave at the moment, but for the future, do you have any thoughts on how to showcase my work? I guess I could maybe scrub the data, but I‚Äôm not sure how effective the story would come across at that point.
It's pretty helpful for me, thank you very much.
Hello everyone, Im a 4th year student and still dont have idea what project to do for my thesis. Anyone here have suggestions on timely projects i should do
11:39 "Flask Wrapper" - had to re-watch it a few times to pick up what he said there. Hope this helps others. (Flask is a Python web application framework).
Thanks for the information. Can you please make a video on feature engineering. How to convert raw data to meaningful data.
so long videos...
That data collection could really be the eye catching thing for recruiter. I am in. Thanks for the tips Ken.
Thanks for the super useful video. You might want to check the audio as the audio level varied a lot during the video
Thank you for your videos. I'm starting at this, just taking notes of what you say and let's see how far I can get.
Can you recommend any coding books that aid in doing these types of supervised and unsupervised models?
Her daddy's bodyguard are there.
Let's quit it.
Fight!
She s daughter of the governor
I'll try.
Do you want the girl too?
We are out of her league.

We are poor data scientist and you're YouTuber and she own the half of the city.
a recommendation to improve videos, please increase your voice or get a stronger mic. thank you
Hi, 
I  work in a research company, can you please suggest me some projects related to Research or HR Domain as i m working in an HR Based Project
Thanks
Hi, I feel like this topic is key for data science, I just wander why do you recommend  Flask? could I use Django? or why not any other technology with python.
#32: Great great video, you are consistent with the message always!!! 
‚ÄúData Science is much about what‚Äôs going into the model as the actual selection and the things that you choose‚Äù wise words!!!  #66daysofdata
Do not understand many of the terminologies used (I believe good insights to know what terms I will need to learn later) but at the same time, they made it a pretty informative video. Thank you for your guidance.
I‚Äôm starting on projects to build my portfolio. Happy that I watched this video on time Thanks Kenüòá
This is a great video, plenty of insight with direction. Thank you.
Could you please make a video for master thesis in data science. As a masters student in my final semester I am struggling to find a topic. I got some idea how to go about but it would be great if you dedicate a video and also please explain  some of the areas for research.
What projects do you recommend Data Analysts to do? & is there a website I can use to build these projects?
Thank yoy for the very informative videos.
I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job.

So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. 

But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it. 

Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time.
Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. 
My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?
Very useful video Ken, thanks for taking the time to create it
Good video
I am an undergraduate math major student. Could you please recommend some project ideas related to mathematics?
Can you recommend any of the datasets in kaggle to begin with.
11:49 wow I literally just learned how to do this for one of my old projects.
Hi Ken! First of all thank you for all the great videos that you are making. I just discovered your channel and I really appreciate it.
As I have no internship or education directly link to programming I would like to create a Github page to show to the company that I'm still competent. I'm looking for a job as data analyst in the oil and gas area. Do you have some ideas about projects that I could do? Thank you in advance!
It‚Äôs so hard to do a project out of new idea üí° feel like just quitting this field 10minths and still a noob in this field kills me from inside makes me wanna pull my hair Everytime I see a blank Jupiter notebook
This is really tons of value
I learn both data science and English from you. you have a fabulous pronunciation. Thank youüî•üî•üî•
Do you have any links to flaskwrapper samples?
You said Everything ü§£
Hi Ken, you recommended having some sort of data collection element involved in our projects but how would you show that? Other than including the datasets in your project files & explaining in a writeup, is there any way to show people what your data collection process is?

Also, would you be able to make a video on working with big data / hadoop sometime in the future (if that's something you've had experience with)?
Thanks a lot Ken! Can you please make a video on what software and programming skills are essential for a data scientist job? I am currently learning deeplearning in python. But I am still pretty weak in data visualization and plotting. What should I learn for data visualization? Which libraries in python or what other softwares should I learn to use?
Sounds like clustering models (unsupervised) can be used to design database tables
Great video, thank you, but these sound more like strictly machine learning than data science tbh
Thanks very useful video,  may i know for the person who is not from the IT background and if they want to start which software they should learn or in more demand, Salesforce, Tableau, QlikView or POWER-BI?

I am very good in excelsheet and i like to find the correlation between two events or things. If you dont mind may i know from where should i start?
wow! u actually took the time to answer every single question! what a boss
Dude you really helped spark a passion for data science in me. Thank you. The hardest part was always knowing where to start.
You doing excellent job Sir.
Love this shit
What about data analysis specific projects? Initially, I thought I want to learn data science but then I've realized I enjoy the data analysis part more.
Please explain any of the machine learning project
Thanks for this video.. It was really helpful. üëå
Thanks Ken for these amazing videos. 
Could you please tell us datasets for these projects from Kaggle.
Nice detailing, Ken!
hi, future me, let me see where you at now! (wish you can find this comment when you back here)
Don‚Äôt forget the ice cream! Lol
I did some network analysis of Game of Thrones characters using Python to find out who is the most important character:
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-most-important-character-game-thrones-i-used-find-lukashevich-/
I'm very happy to watch Ken's content before starting my senior year of college. 
Not aiming for a DS title right away, looking for for BI Analytics.
What feature engineering actually means?
thank you. it was really helpful
I have another question, do you think kaggle kernels are a valid substitute to GitHub projects? Cause you can use kernels to show your thought process, among other stuff
Like having 6 descriptive kernels, based on the projects you recommend above, would be suitable for applying?
How did you learn complicated feature engineering? Through reading kaggle kernels?
1:16 Thank me later
what is considered as a project in data science industry  ??
@ Ken Jee  is it okay to dive  directly into coding and then googling  one by one to the understand the usage and the math behind the algorithm.
Which statistics book would you recommend for data Science
Hi, thanks for your video. I wish there were English subtitles...for non native like me.
Great video dude. I think this is a topic that most learners are interested in and you approached it very well, all actionable information and no fluff.
Great video sir! For starters, it would be interesting for you to start posting videos on the specifics as you do the projects. That means, ‚Äòlearn by doing‚Äô. Most of the content out there is platitude and generalistic. Would be interesting if you started doing that.
Thanks Ken.
Hey Ken, great video ;)
So I have done a project where ive scrapped data from a website, performed EDA and built a classifier analysing the performance of various ML model. How exactly do you suggest mentioning this on my resume? Like can you give me an example on how to go about writing it?
Thanks
Great video..... I want to do a project related to financial institution could you please recommend any?
how long did it take u to make ur own website
Hi Ken, 


Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). 


In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve? 


Thank you for all your videos!
Can you please suggest some tutorials for learning deployment of Machine learning models
Great advice bro, had to give it a like and subscribed
You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills. Nevertheless I sincerely appreciate the value you have provided through your video. Thank you
As soon as I saw that there are no ads, I subscribed.
Same like as this channel if you any one of you want to do data science projects and M.L and A.I projects please refer to this M.I.T student channel and i am not promoting, But those who are interested get to this data science Channel for projects and about latest technologies

Super useful! Thanks!
Hi Ken, loving the channel! I‚Äôm likely going to try and push into data science once my PhD is complete and I was wondering how big should a project be to make it worthy of going on a resume? I imagine something written in a few hours wouldn‚Äôt be worthy but where exactly this line falls I‚Äôm not so sure?
I did a sentiment analysis where I compared several models, and logistic regression performed the best. I then scraped my own data from twitter for a predictive analysis.
Any ideas on How I could begin choosing a topic for my Honours(Postgraduate)  research (thesis) this year. It is in "Data Science for business decision support".
I don't have any computer science background but I really would something interesting in this area because it is quite a broad area.
good stuff. prowling your page for some walk throughs too
Can you please describe broadly about advanced feature engineering?
I have Bank data contains customer Demographics including Account Type and Bank Balances. I want to know which customer to Target for Financing the bank products like Insurance, Autos etc
Ken please make tutorials video on specific Data Science projects....it would be helpful
That last part of your video was top tier. For my capstone project in college, I had did a semester long data science project that had a ton of different parts. We collected our own data, cleaned it, and created new features out of existing ones. We didn‚Äôt have enough time to create a website or proper interface to interact with our results, but putting in that extra work is really what made the project stand out.
What's the "fla..scraper" thing you mentioned to automate the scraping? Loved the video <3
This is great. I've always wanted to go into data science, but I keep hearing the whole "Go to college" deal, and honestly, I can't do it now (I did college and that was a failure).
Thank you so much 
This is really helpful
hey Ken can you plzz suggest me some data science projects
Hey Ken, 
AMAZING video!!!

If I collect my own data, how can I reference it in the GitHub? Is it a good practice to add the CSV/txt file in the repository?
Are you a data scientist
Hi Ken, I am from india and I've just begun my journey to become a dats scientist. I'm not even really sure is data is the thing i love? I'm exploring my options and would do masters accordingly. Is it possible i can get in touch with you if I stumble upon something because you do look like you know what you're talking about. And also i subscribed üî•
Thank you for ALL your recommendations. I'm studying Data analaysis under master course in South Korea. I have several questions below.
1. Do I need to follow the instructions in this video clip step by step?
2. Which is better to update portfolio between Github and Kaggle?
3. Which site could be a proper sameple to collect data at the beginning step?
Bro work on the sound level it's too low
Plz increase your sound volumes
hey ken.. i just subscribed ..plzz a heart for me as well?
Thanks, great advice!
Hey Ken, what kind of math requirements are needed for data scientist?
Wow thank you YouTube algo! I‚Äôm an undergrad DS major and can‚Äôt wait to share with others in my major!
you look like a boss!!!
üî•üî•
Hey Ken, 
Could you elaborate more on last 3 points in your next video!
Comment first, then watch!
Thanks, Ken! Great video. Has anything changed in the past three years, with respect to the more recent advances?
From Today I start Learn Data Science From This Channel. I Don't Have Any Degrees üòÇ?
Do you usually use tools such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, association rule mining, neural networks?
Thank you sir ‚ö°
how often do you write your models from scratch instead of using library imports?
Nice Simple Beginning without the fancy graphics and music :-)
Quick question : what tech or languages do I need to learn to be a data scientist?
Thank you ken
Hey Ken, nice video! I have a quick question, do you happen to work alot with data structures (Ex. linked list, pointers, trees) within the data science field? I struggled alot to understand these concepts and it was especially hard since everything was online :(
The best data science youtuber. I am glad to find your channel
I'm not sure if you would respond to this but in Australia you can do a double bachelor's degree: mathematics and data science. Do you think the mathematics is worth it.
I am a web developer with 2 year work experience in korea. I plan to move to us after getting married with my boyfriend(us citizen) and work as a data scientist. Im worried with my english. My english might be ok to handle daily bussiness/situations . I first thought that technical skills might be the most crucial to data scientists. But I recently got to know that consulting is a part of data scientists' work. To me, consulting is considered as an area which requires high level english skills. How important enlgish skills do you think to data scientists?!
hi. I had a question. is there are something different data science and data scientist or are they same
Thanks Ken, i am due to a career change here, i want to study data science and i have found your overview here extremely useful.
What degree is best for data science?
Will you love me even I'm far away?
I'll build you a database that can automate all your transactions as long as you are with me.
Even I understand little of your work as long as your true come over here.
If you have the courage come over here.
How can I help you ,please talk to me, please sent me an email or add me at my Facebook account. You know my name please don't hesitate.ü¶Å
As a 15 year old sophomore. What are your tips for getting well versed in the field of data science. Im taking ap statistics my junior year so that should help some what, and I will also be taking ap calculus. Do you reccomend a job shadow?
#31: IT jobs have similar activities, but obviously, DS has a lot of percentage in data üìä
I remember doing those activities years ago but is not IT Analyst called anymore, now has the fancy name #DataAnalyst #66daysofdata
The steps are really helpful for me but I have one doubt about How to check whether my system or laptop will be compatible for a specific project? When I start doing project I invest more amount of time in doing installation and facing hardware comparability issues......
I mostly work on just querying, data manipulation and software engineering . Is it actually Data Science? How can I build on this to become a Data Scientist? Thank you for helping everyone!
What education/diploma/degree do you have/need to become a data scientist?
This was helpful! But I still....wonder....where does the actual Science come in to the picture?
do you think statistics as a major is a nice foundation while also learning python on the side?
Data science is worse or best field?
Do we need to learn programming to become a data scientist?
Hi Ken, it was really great video.. Need your suggestion here...
I am currently working as Tech support in well known Firewall company, but I want to get out of Support, as I do not find rotating shifts good in long run.
I am thinking to get into Data science. It will be kind of new field for me, however I know Python basics.
Is Data scientist Job stressful? 
How much time it take an average to learn tools and tech for DS.
I'm looking into this field and this video was really helpful! Thank you for your insight!
Thank you for Ken :)
THANKS for uploading good videos for data science..  I have watched your all videos. Can you make a video on what type of project we can make to put it on our resume and learn from it . It would be a great pleasure if you make a beginner to pro. Thank you.
I've been watching a ton of "Anaconda for beginners" videos and they all jump in assuming you have your environments set up and know basic python. You explain things simply for those who are REALLY just getting started. This is fantastic! Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
Hi, your this fundamentals series is very helpful but one thing is please zoom the screen . Its very hard to see and focus
Watched it again. totally worth the second view.
Video is great , but I have one issue with it.  from time stamp 28:00 what you were typing was not visible. Also the font is a bit small for YouTube video resolution. However I saw the whole video because can't afford to miss any information from your videos. ; )
#30: Holly Macaroni!!!!!!
To understand the beauty of this video, I had to struggle on my first projects, a lot of good tips in one single video. 
A must-see for new Data Scientists! #66daysofdata
Where i can get this version of the csv ? Tks in advance
Great content Ken, it's been a while since I was all over YouTube looking...but Ken, would you check the pivot_table, cause the "aggfunc = mean" and the "aggfunc=count" give the same result, they're both MEAN...I'm on Jupyter
Hi Ken, why don't you use R Studio as your IDE? It does support Python..
Why is it inclusive for .loc but exclusive for .iloc for the end of the range? I got confused for a while there thinking that I missed something lol.. really great content Ken! I just started getting into data science and your videos helped me a lot, thanks a lot man
Great lecture, easy to understand and gain a lot of skills in the vedio. Thanks
These fundamental type of videos you make are such a huge help. Thank you for sharing your knowledge!
Hey Ken!

Great effort on making clear the data science fundamentals which would help them doing projects for jobs / internships.

Hope to connect with you via LinkedIn as I sent you a connection request.
really good stuff Ken, I've been looking for tutorial like this one, thank you!!!
Was following steps and at Filtering, are we able to filter string column (e.g Country Name out of Country column)
And how do I input ' I ' ('or' symbol??)
GREAT WORK KEN!! 

One doubt, On the last area of appending samples, getting error on the code.



sampl= append(sampl)

NameError: name 'append' is not defined
Amazing video, I've been following the whole steps and learning a lot!. P.S: Sometimes we cannot se the bottom of the screen when you're typing.
This was immensely helpful, thanks for putting in the time to make this vid!
5:35 - how would you do that? would you mind including the syntax to change several columns in one go?
I most definitely prefer the PyCharm IDE, seems overall more flexible and more options
very very helpful contents..thank you ,, :D
Codes you are writing downside are not visible , please take care of that issue. Otherwise the video is awesome.
Hey Ken, please recommend me a budget laptop configuration for data science as a starter. my laptop is freezing and taking a lot of time to process data. Thank you!!!

and your content is AMAZING!!
Sir I'm doing just like you in the command data.type but it returns me a error saying: AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'type'. Could you please explain why this happen? Thank you in advance.
Great content! Your videos helps me with studying a lot.
code along. :)
Thank you Ken for the video this is really helpful and it works really cool... Excited to go ahead and explore more...

Just a quick update-


If your ctrl + alt is not working in spyder then use F9 or edit your settings.
You can refer to this video-
https://youtu.be/8r2gMyt8BS8


Also during plotting graphs if it shows this-
Figures now render in the Plots pane by default. To make them also appear inline in the Console, uncheck "Mute Inline Plotting" under the Plots pane options menu. 

Refer to this video- https://youtu.be/MNkJT-5g8fU
#29: First time using Spyder - I always use Jupyter - a great time to learn something new, was fun ü§ì
I do like to see the variables on one side of the screen & was like a crash course on pandas üêº and spyder!
#66daysofdata
I started learning Python language four days ago, I found your videos by coincidence on you tube. I'm really enjoying the content you're offering us ... thanks a lot! and keep going
great intro exploration, easy for first timers, nice recap for beginners. thanks
Hi Ken. I hope you are well. Thank you for the great deal of work you are doing to help here. I was trying to replicate this video on my own on Spyder.  When I tried "7" and "x= 7". I got  "runcell(0, 'C:/Users/jider/untitled0.py')" in my console. What would you advise I do to get through this please
Great video, really helping me with my mini project :)
Ken would really appreciate  if you put some videos of different alogirthms such as logistic reg,decision tree,random forest,etc
Hi Ken, i am beginner here, how to display the methods and properties list of pd. like you did at 6:30 in the video?
Great video for newbie like myself. Finally able to relate the self-help python course with the actual production on a dataset. 
Trying to brush up more exploration, although had some difficulty when hit the 'Graph' section. 

Unable to form histogram as it depends on the data type (seems like data type object is not possible) or maybe need to import 'matplotlib' or 'seaborn' (knowing the difference after Googling it)
Ken. Thank you so much for these videos.  I have an issue, when plotting the hist, the x axis takes from year 0 to 2020. How can I fix that?
Hello Ken,
You are doing great job. I just want to suggest you 2 things.
(1) - Zoom on the coding part, bcuz its very hard to read code when you are on mobile.
(2) - Use jupyter notebook instead of this... As the interface is very clear and friendly...
Thanks man. I really aprreciate the video. Am havign error with matplotlib . I have it installed already but it not showing the graph. and saying no module named matplotlib.pyplot. please help
Hello Ken!


I'm a beginner and need some help. Whenever I run code, on my "Console 1/A" window on the bottom right of the Spyder IDE it doesn't show the output of the code.


Instead it spits out:  runcell(0, 'file path location of current file code is being type in')



For example, if I type in a 7 like you did and try to run it . this is what I get for the output on the console.


ln [2]: runcell(0, 'C:/Users/James/.spyder-py3/temp.py')


How do I fix this so I can see the output of my code ? This is mainly annoying because I can't even see the first few rows of the dataframe when you called  .head() because this is the output I keep getting, help :(
Ken, I'm struggling (beginner) with the first lines of code. How do I make the lines appear in the Console 1/A and execute them?
Your channel is what I've been looking for at a long time, really appreciate these Fundamentals series
why not use jupyter lab? this looks painful!
nice and simple explanation.. thanks
Hey man, just wanted to let you know that these are greatly appreciated.
Hi I am doing MCA now I am interested in data science I am think to do courses in data science . U can plz tell some tips
This is awesome! So helpful
#28: Loved the background sound of the wind üèù
Agree about the DS as a new field & how the meaning is sometimes apart or risky for different industries #66daysofdata
Really Informative video
I watch some kind of Data Science videos everyday , so that is why you are in my recommendations a lot . But this particular night I suddenly got really anxious that I wouldn‚Äôt be good enough , and your video popped up at the same moment and I clicked instantly because I wanted to feel some wave of calmness . Does this come of as creepy? Sorry about that ! üòÇ ! But yeah, I‚Äôm calmer now . :) eeps
I found the wind + your voice + content  a great combination actually lol thanks for the info!
That was a windy dayüå™
Found your Article on Medium, and now i  am watching your channel , really informative , thanks man , keep up the good work
Great content! Your videos give me a great insight into the career field I am wanting to get into. I must say your are spot on when you mentioned happiness and how being stimulated by working on something can drive happiness!  Seeking happiness and a career field with mental stimulation may be the number one driving factor as to why I am wanting to enter this career field, not to mention the other perks as well.
appreciate the description!
Thanks for the video keep it up!
Hello, I am in my junior year of a data science degree but I have not had any projects. The internship application period has just started but the only experience I have to show is what I have done for school work. Some queries, some R, tableau and excel. Should I include these to showcase my skills even if they aren't necessarily projects?
Hello sir 
Can i apply for internship at 2nd year of my college in data science
is it accessible for foreigners as the same for Americans?
A helpful video for me. It will help me to bring positive and necessary changes in my journey of learning data science.

My learning-
Explaining the WHY is really important which shows the purpose of doing something.
Company-specific preparation is important while sending a resume and cover letter.

Ken, correct me if I am wrong but do you think you worked as a consultant in the past which is helping you to be a good communicator or explainer?
Awesome video Ken, which regression  project is best to do for resume/portfolio?
Thanks for sharing these awesome tips! I was wondering what kind of working positions would be helpful to have when applying to a data science internship. I'm hoping to go to a university that has a co-op program that begins first year but I'm most likely not going to get a data science position that early. Do you have any recommendations for what kind of positions I should look for that would be helpful for ending up in data science?
Thanks for the information
Thank you for these DS internship vids. I'm preparing for an interview for a DS position rn and you're helping me a lot.
You my Rabi. Thanx!!
Hey Ken!! Thanks for this great video. I am in a dilemma. I am doing my undergrads (2nd year) on Computer Science and I am really interested in data Science. I have started my journey towards it and almost there to do my own projects (Started doing projects on Kaggle). I have work placement on 3rd year. By then I hope to have some projects done on my own. But I doubt companies hire an undergrad for data science role. I have heard that they prefer master's student. What's your say in this? I don't want to change my career path now.
Hey Ken! I have a question. For internship applications, how complex do the portfolio projects on my resume need to be? For example, there are some datasets (like Kaggle's Titanic) in which I could create a pretty accurate regression model in just a few lines of code, but that obviously doesn't seem like enough to include in a portfolio.
Further, if I'm taking an online machine learning course, and there are 'projects' given but solutions to those projects given as well, I'm assuming that those projects wouldn't be wise to include in a portfolio?
You make things sound less overwhelming while also being real about putting in the work. Thank you for the positive energy brother!
I am a mechanical engineer..of no prior knowledge of DS... Doing project as you suggested from kaggle and making it unique..lets seeü§ûü§û
I have a hard dilemma, where I graduated while having a data analyst internship but wished I did a data scientist internship on top of it during college. I am guessing that my best route should be to land a data analyst role and then work my way up to a data scientist position as I gain more domain and real world experience working with data/working on more projects added on my portfolio?
do companies in the US or Europe hire remote data scientists or analysts from outside the country to work remotely or that role is exclusive for local people and must be in the workplace?
When you bring up projects I understand the concept of what a project is but how do I do a project as an undergrad. Should I lookup some project or think more creatively and do something unique?
Hi Ken, I am taking online course on data scientist currently, with a institute known as Simplilearn. Not yet complete the whole course, but I am having preliminary exposure on data science using Python and R. Thinking to apply a data science internship to accumulate my working experience. Do you think it is a good time to apply for internship?
What were your skills and education when you applied for the first internship?
When are the internship cycles?
Thanks for the video Ken! Do you apply through LinkedIn or prefer applying to the companies directly?
This was so helpful. My background is in biology and cognitive science/psychology and throughout undergrad I've been using Python and R to run a variety of different analyses for hypotheses, research questions and data insights. Most of these don't have a ML component, I'm learning that now. could these projects still be relevant for landing a data science internship?
I truly feel ashamed while typing this text but what do you literally mean saying project? I mean for instance I think an original idea and then collect relatively data from sources then create a model for prediction. Or I just choose a Kaggle Project and try to accomplish the aim as good as I can. Which one does count for a resume? THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THOUGHTS BTW ‚ù§Ô∏è greetings from Turkey
Hi! What internship salary someone like you could ask for? I don't want to be fooled by an employer and I don't want to ask too much
Sir please suggest best online course for data science.
My biggest problem is communication. I'm very bad at communicating üòî
I don't usually comment on videos but I just want to thank you for making these videos. I really like the down to earth style with lots of practical advice. Your videos have helped me a lot and I am definitely rooting for your success.
Hey Ken ,can you be elaborate about how and where from you choose the projects? And also how do go about them? Do you learn on the go?
i have mediocre level knowledge on a couple of programming languages. How would i start working on any of the projects that you mentioned in the video?
You are doing a great work Ken. Thanks for the video
Hi!! I was actually struggling on an assignment for hours together and finally encountered your video..it solved my issues within minutes..I immediately subscribed and ended up on this one..Keep doing more videos..You rock!!
Thanks for the video!¬†

At 9:12 you mention a cheat sheet. Do you recommend any in particular? I've tried looking but quality tends to vary a lot.
Can you make a vid of your resume so that we can learn from that
Thank you for sharing man
Great video. It really shows your passion for Data Science.
nice video!!!
Great, Keep going.
Another great detailed video! Thanks ken. 
I have a request for you.  Could you do a project where you predict the winner of 2018 FIFA world cup? I would like to see how you gather data and which approch you take to work on the project!
Hey Ken! Big fan. I just landed my first internship and would like to really thank you for your videos.
Hi, found your video really interesting! I have little to no experience regarding programming. I have an impressive portfolio and took several beginner level programming courses(python, c++, matlab), however i forgot almost everything. Do you think a data science intership(40h/month) is doable while also being a full time engineer student?
Exited,Teachable
6:26-Explain Why you want to work in that company and how will you benefit the company
Thanks for the tips! I hope that I'll pass the interviews in my data science internship
This gives me confidence. Awesome ken...üëç
She hotter in personal.
#26: Internships, what a topic. The DraftKings story is great, and the tip about storytelling!! We need to talk about what we really like!
#66daysofdata
Hlo ken
Thanks for Another great video üî•
Ken thanks so much for these videos.  I was able to land an internship for an online retailer, and look forward to getting some great experience!  I am hoping to turn it into a longer internship with them 6 mo - 1yr as I graduate with a master's in DS in august of next year.  Do you think this is a good plan for transitioning to one semi-related field into data science?  Again thanks so much for the videos!
Your videos help so much!! Currently an undergrad physics/data science major :) hoping to pursue computational astrophysics and to use ML :)
Thank you Ken! I needed this.
Hello Ken,
Thank you for numerous helpful videos. I am excited about your future uploads. I am a Data science major who is also interested in working in sports analytics field (especially soccer). Hope I can learn from you a lot. I added you on LinkedIn so we can get connected  as well. Thank you!!
Good video
Thanks for the info
Wahoowa! Taking a Data Analytics in a Sports Context course at Darden now and came across your channel. Keep it up!
Does the PGA still use historical benchmarks for sg in terms of yardages? I feel like keeping a dynamic calculation for real-time analysis would improve to accuracy of the statistic especially since the purpose seems to be in line with that expectation.
dude you have my dream job. Hire me when I'm finished at Apple.
hey, thanks for the video. I wanted to ask where do you get the stats for golf? I'm looking for historical data of each player for each game they played.
Thanks for explaining the technique. It is really interesting...
Hey Ken, Thanks for the video. I'm curious as to how the expected score is calculated? A 150 yrd approach shot at the US Open from the rough and the same shot at an average tour event don't have the same expected score. Does SG score these 2 shots as equals?

Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score. 

Essentially what I am after is this, are strokes gained calculated in isolation within the same round, tournament, PGA tour Season, or every PGA golf shot ever taken?
#25: I had to google every single concept about golfüèåüèª, not a fan here, but the metric about strokes gained gave me some insight, some questions: 
- How I can find metrics for some sports that not have a deep study, just checking variables and play with them?
- Do you recommend a way to approach (course, book) how to find those metrics?
You hit the point on this one, spark curiosity for me!!
#66daysofdata
Where do you find these expected values or the bench mark? Like just from PGA your stats? Trying to figure out how I can calculate my own Strokes gained at my home club.
Thanks for explaining stroke gained clearly. It is very informative.
Good video, that was interesting, thanks.
Yes thank you for the video... Subject area expertise is really important.

I have one question, you mentioned if you collect data on your own it will add more value. How can we do that? Can you please give me a example? 

For example, Ind vs ENG test is going on so if I collect data of that matches is it considered as data collected by me? Or correct me if I am worng...
#24: For me, subject area expertise is that inside question about where we are passionate to do and build. A great phrase in this video is "Build that expertise" 
True.
What set you apart from the others?
Great question! #66daysofdata
#23: In USA, I found it easier to choose something that you like and again, there are tons of smart people who can help to build a career and are willing to help, like @KenJee_DS
Nice to know why you decide to choose MS Computer Science instead of MS in Data Science. #66daysofdata
Please do a video 

detailing 

your cs masters

- how you chose it
- what courses, in class
- homework
- coursework
- research work
- pre-requisite studies
- formal informal

Thanks.
please provide a list of your cs courses in Univ and outside. Thanks.
5:50 that‚Äôs a lot to learn in a masters, I mean broad.

Hey Ken 
Did you pursue ms in computer science after mba degree? Was your second degree mba?
would of you have done a Data Science school/bootcamp? I'm applying to Lambda School's Data Science course, which is 7 months long. Much more time than some 2-10 week bootcamp... there's just too much to learn within such a small time frame.
I am really inspired by everything that you have said. The videos that  you have made , actually help me alot on the journey to become a data scientist.
Proudly Asian!
Hi ken
Your videos are really informative. Could you please help me a little bit. I am a beginner and  I am currently in search of setting up my domain field. Then I came to know about data science and I think it will suits me. So can you give a road map on where should I start learning. I have a basic knowledge in python and sql. Could you please reply to my comment.
Great video Ken. My placements are in about a month's time. This helped answer a lot of questions. Will look into docker and sagemath .
Thanku for sharing! I know these nowüôÇ
Hii ken, currently, I am doing my bachelor's in computer science and I am really interested in the field of data science. I just want to know whether it is compulsory to have a master's for a data scientist?
This for u brother.
If the girl get out, I asked her name and number. How much do you want it?
#22: Great video, Data Science is BIG, a lot of data cleaning, no control of projects, tons of smart people in the environment & things to do, new technologies, research, framework.
Sometimes it feels overwhelming ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è#66daysofdata
I recognize that degree you have hanging up bc I have one just like it. Wahoowa!
Great info. Great videos. Thanks from Colombia üëç
Solid video!   I am kind of binging your channel as I am committed to getting a job in Finance with Data Science.  You mentioned  data wrangling being over 50% of the workload at a job.  I am going hard on Pandas and all supporting libraries (2 - 3 hours a day for a couple of months).  Do you think this will cover the data wrangling side or are there other libraries/stacks/tools that I should be getting into?  Thank you for all of the great content!
Amazing video Ken!! While practising analysis of a simple dataset, if most of the predictors are not statistically significant, how do we handle such a scenario?
Hey Ken, It was a great insight about data science..Can you make a video on How to explain a data science or ML model to my manager / stakeholders? with example..Thank you..
I have completed  my high school  in india.  I have decided to pursue  a course  in data science.  What  should  i learn first  (I Just  know  it has statics  and programs)  I don't have any basic idea.  Is there any  free apps to learn about  data science  .what  must be the basic  qualifications  to get a secure job in data science  courses.
Great video! Though is it possible for me coming from finance background to have a work in Data Science?
I am coming from computer science background. I took lots of stats courses but doesn't seem to sink in into me. I keep using just basic stats for my work in the finance/decision support department in hospital. I am starting to learn Python. Based on your experience what kind of statistics I should focus on study on that I can use at work? I plan to apply machine learning to emergency department that is a project I plan to take on.
hey ken , apart from docker and sagemaker can you make a video based on what we can learn now that will help us in production stage
I just stumbled on your videos and I must say the contents are really insightful. I will try to watch asmuch as possible and let you know what my questions are. Thank you!
Awesome
What would you say the difference is between data scientist and machine learning engineer?
Another Great Video , Thanks man
Hi Ken,  your videos are very informative and everything is to the point. so, perhaps you can help me understand the role of SQL in data science and to which extent we use SQL in problem solving.
Well i am also thinking to start a career in data science,  but while learning i got stuck and didn't understand the thought process of that code,  is this normal??  Or i need to do something else
Thanks for the points! I'm suuuper excited to start my DS internship!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I totally agree with your points.
Do I need to practice leetcode for data science interviews? Or is it ok to know only statistics, mathematics, Python's data science libraries and Kaggle contests, but no interview coding questions(the ones related to datastrucrures and algorithms)?
Hey ken , I am 16 and I am really interested in learning data science and pursue it as my career ... Any tips for me
Ken, TNX for very informative video. Just if you need an idea regarding new videos, I would be interested in your way to learn and apply new stuff effectively. There is so much to learn on a regular basis. It's currently tough for me to grasp, what is really worth to spend time on (e.g. learning statistics theory vs hand-on experince by try and error).

Of course you should learn R if you are interested in ML and statistics. Python is a waste of time if your job is related to data science and analysis. I have used both languages and find R to be superior to python.
Tqvm for sharing your experience and opinion
I love how R can be used by people with no programming background and can be good at it right away.  I know some are saying that Python is an easy language and that it‚Äôs like an english but when it comes to data analysis, data wrangling etc. i feel like R syntax is much easier to read compared to python syntax when doing data analysis. I love how Dplyr has this thing called ‚Äúpipe‚Äù where it makes your code much much easier to read. I‚Äôm pretty sure most of you guys get my point.
I wrote my bachelors thesis about a programm I wrote in R. I like it :)
I have a scholarship that will fund most of an MSBA, but they use R for the whole program and no Python. I‚Äôd prefer Python, but do you think there‚Äôs any value in learning R first? I have no programming background
Focus on one at the the beginning then move to another one to take the advantage of the two nice software
Im more to business focus DS so I'm using python as my primary tool. I will use R when I am working on a relevant domain for it. Pretty much depends on the domain of the project I am working on. For business domain, Python is sufficient for me at least. Cheers.
why do we want to program for data science. We need to make that clear. Data Science and ML is all about finding patterns and predicting results. Once you get the results then use anything to make that result work. I'm really fed up of hearing R is not flexible, R is not programmer friendly. But does it get the job done, yes, then where's the argument. This trend started when programmers got to believe they can do ML and DS
Hi Sir, I am not a programmer 
I am a Statistics Graduate Student Pursuing PG in Advances Statistics
What should I learn for Data analytics or statistical modelling R  or Python ?
Actually, I learned R somewhat during my college days because it was in my syllabus. It was good but yes as medical research is not relevant for me right now then I am learning python these days... 
I think R may be useful these days as there many predictions and research is on COVID.
I‚Äôm new, but I personally really like R
For someone who tries to learn a programming language to specifically run statistical analysis (GLM, regression, ANOVA, FA, HLM, SEM...), R is definitely the one to go with.
I already kinda know beginner/intermediate R due to university (math) but from all the videos information I get, everyone suggests python so I want to learn python... But my selected masters ALSO does things in R(msc stats and data science) so fuck my life I guess I'll have to Learn python after R the way things are going üòÇüòÇ
Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple üçé to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data,  the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data.

Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc..

Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. 

Machine learning,  users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models.

If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it. 

Every language is important,  know what you need to achieve first.  Than choose what is most comprehensive language that will fulfill  ur need and don't rush yourself much.
#21: I totally agree it's better to start with #Python, is more flexible, easy to learn, with more examples and people involved. And if it's required R, as all programming languages are easy to transfer. #66daysofdata
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Should you learn R? No, because you already know it.
How about SAS for data analysis?
I use R on my work for almost 2yrs. And wondering if it is worth it to sticking on R or transition completely to python. My work is mostly for data engineering and automation.
Did he say ‚Äúpython was easier to manipulate data than R‚Äù...  this guy does not really know R
Thank you for your insight!  very helpful!
To be honest, a person who can wield two swords is the one who is the most deadly. I like to leverage both in my workflow. R gives me beautiful visualizations and rapid fast data cleaning with tidyverse packages, and I can use python for fitting machine learning models with sklearn and dimensionality reduction, as well as neural networks. Both have their benefits and I don‚Äôt think one should use just one vs the other.
I like the way Ken Lee is replying to every comment.

 Your effort will  always be appreciated
want to develop a fashion designing bot i.e a software that can generate new apparels on giving instructions by a non programmer designer eg colour combo, age, gender, season etc
So which language should I choose R or Python
How about a movement the other way around, from R to Python? or at least, how to start obtaining some fluency in python when you have started with learning R? 
thanks.
I prefer using both,sometimes its just exiciting if you have tools that Can close the disadvantages of another tools.I used R for analyzing data and it's easy to do many statistical testing than python, in my opinion,but remember you also need to know SQL and hadoop for this data science
thanks for the advice, i`ll start learning python right now. the quality of the video would be 3xbetter (at least for me) if you look right to the camera when speaking. idk maybe im weird but i feel it makes a big difference.  thanks again :)
I first learned python when I started programming and switched to R because that's the language my DS course was taught on. However, it would be hard for me to go back to python, I'm just way too used to Rstudio's interface. I don't know if there's an IDE that would let you have the same 4 panel layout on python
In general, python and R are very similar in my opinion.
yes, python is better in many ways, espetially for programming issues, but for data wrangling (dplyr etc.), data analisys, visualisation (ggplot) and modelling, there is nothing what comes close to tidyverse. I tried to transition to python in the academia, and it was just painful. cheers
hi Ken if i already use R should
 I learn python or continue with R
Very informative, thank you !
Good title
Hi Everyone - It appears that this api is not working right now. People are returning 0 tweets. I will update if anything changes. Until then, please keep  an eye on this: https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues. that is where the issues are being reported. Try these if you want some other alternatives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrZ6Uns7bYc
Is there any other way to return tweets as this is not working?
nice big forehead
Simply awesome!
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all' @Ken Jee can you help
Is this a private module, why does it give an error at the end?
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all'

What does the above error mean?
Thanks for the tutorial - super useful!  Is it possible to use the Twitterscapper module to "pull" tweets by their tweet ID?
Does anyone knows how I can fix this: attributeerror: 'nonetype' object has no attribute 'find_all'? I can't find a viable solution to fix this so far!
from twitterscraper import query_tweets is resulting in an error for me  (AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all'). Can anyone help?
Is everyone still can use this module today? because my code returning 0 tweets.
Hey Ken, thanks for the video. I tried this, but I couldn't gather any tweets returns only empty dataframe but no error. Can you suggest any solution?
I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scrapy.conf' for after import query_tweets. It won't properly run.
I have a question. In the query_tweets structure, how do I filter tweets only from certain accounts?
how to instead of begin and end date just give the latest one since the script started running?
This is awesome!
is still working?  got the error 'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute '_write_to'    Can't find  a solution
Why it appear SyntaxError: invalid syntax for enddate = end_date?
This is very simple yet useful example. Thanks.
#19: This is a great one! I will be working on this one, has been a challenge doing the scraping using the API, and seems I took the difficult approach! #66daysofdata
why nothing happened? is this not working right now?
Hi ken, Im new with python. how to instal twitter scraper? when I pip install twitterscraper, the result "syntax error: invalid syntax" 
Im using python 3.9. 

btw, ur tutorial was great.
Very much helpful
sorry, why i got htmlsessiin object or request_html module?
in case u r intrested
from twitterscraper import query_tweets
import datatime as dt
import pandas as pd

begin_data = dt.date(2020,10,13)
end_date = dt.date(2020,10,14)

#user = realDonaldTrump

tweets = query_tweets("vote", begindate= begin_data, enddate= end_date,limit= limit, lang=lang)
df=pd.DataFrame(t._dict_for t in tweets)
the above code gives me blank or square bracket result[]
I tried to implement this code using sublime and run it on windows powershell. I got an error on line tweets = query_tweets, unexpected keyword argument begindate.
can we add url instead of user names ?
I'm getting the follwing error: 'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute
Please advise.
Hey Ken, is there a way to add multiple search queries within Python.

For example, I want to search for tweets that include the term "Australia" and either "olympics OR sport".
HI Ken, Has it worked again?
Hi, Is it possible to get single tweet by the url only? I found twitterscraper.query.query_single_page(query, 'english', pos, retry=50, from_user='use_id', timeout=60, use_proxy=False), can you give an example, like "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1293170815052152835" and return a dictionary of info. in this tweet?
Is notre dam fire a searched keywords in tweets or what does it refers to ...? And how to add the parameter of hashtag??
This Video is really good, but it does not give 24 hours tweets.
Thank you so much for this tutorial, it's been the most useful one for my scraper projects so far!
Hi I would like to get the tweets with respect to a specific key word for a specified time period
Greate Help
Hey Ken thank you for this very helpful video! I'm using your code and I tried to scrap tweets for a specific user but I can't  use it for a specific user. What could the problem be there?HELP

If it's not working on your pc, try on another laptop or your friend's laptop with editing query.py. My friend is a savior!
It still shows 0 tweets even when I edit in the query.py, man :(
Thank you so much for the very useful tutorials!
This is a very well explained video! I am trying to get the tweets of one specific user, but the 'user' parameter that you mentionned doesn't seem to work ... any ideas on how I could achieve this? thanks!
Hi guys! 
So, it seems like this has stopped working, I found the fix on Github tho, 
Here's how to go about it: 
This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query.py from
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST)}
to
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST), 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}
that should fix the issue.
Here's the github link: https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/296
Ken - will you kindly pin this comment for everyone's good? 
Cheers!
PS: query.py can be found typically at: 
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\twitterscraper
Thanks for the video. I run the following:
tweets = query_tweets("Trump", begindate = begin_date,enddate=end_date,limit=limit,lang=lang)

INFO: queries: ['Trump since:2020-06-01 until:2020-06-02']
INFO: Got 0 tweets (0 new).

received 0 tweets. would you happen to know why?
Hi Ken, thanks for sharing the video, it's clear and gets rigth to the point. However, though I follwed each step, once I try to run the code I always get the following output:
INFO: Got 0 tweets (0 new).
INFO: Got 0 tweets (0 new).
regardless of query, limit or language used. Do you have any idea of why this happens?

but all the time getting 0 results. Could you please help. 
Thanks
The best video on scraping tweets. Easy to understand. However, I could scrape tweets only for a day. The next day onwards, every time I run the code, it returned 0 tweets. What could be the possible reason and how could I rectify it? The result was same irrespective of the topic or timeline. Thanks.
Hey this is a super helpful video, I am trying to do the same using datetime.date.today so I don't have to keep updating the day but the twitterscraper module only seems to be able to search when the date is formatted with commas and no leading zeroes as you have done - do you have any idea how to get this to work?
i watched your video and quite i understand many things but when i hit f9 key it is showing an error : ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'twitterscrapper
Please help me ASAP
Hi, i am so frustated i cant import my module in my spyder, how i can get it ?
do you prefer spyder rather than pycharm?
Thank you for the useful video! I run the codes a number of times just for checking. I do successfully get the tweets, but sometimes it returns  with different numbers of tweets. Do you know why is that the case, and how to resolve it? I did not set any limit for querry_tweets.
Pretty cool Video (O.O), Thanx a ton :)
how can I get all comments from one  tweet
Hi, Thanks for the cool video.
Can you please confirm do we need any developer account in order to get past month tweets? Also i want to extract tweets from specific location, is it possible? Further, please confirm if we can specify hashtags and keyword based search with this method.
twitterscraper username --user --csv -o name.csv - it works great. Thank you so much. But in the list are no replies. How to collect replies to the same file?
Can't seem to figure out how to query by twitter handle
Awesome tutorial! simple and efficient! thanks a lot!!
How can I get about 75k to 100k tweets without retweets? please help me out
This is the best video ever on Scraping tweets from Twitter. 
Is there any provision for getting tweets for a particular keyword depending on number of followers?
Its explained really good! Also switched to Spyder IDE now. Its way better (in my opinion) than VSCode.
Title of the background instrumental pls üôèüôèüôè
How can i export the pandas DataFrame for the scraped tweeter data as CSV to save on my system memory ??
Hi, I would like to know how to get fake and real labeled news using twitterscrapper. First of all is it possible to do something like that?  I am very new to this.
Hi Ken! Thank you so much for the clear explanation! When I run the code, I encounter the problem of: thread 'Supervisor' crashed: AttributeError("'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute '_write_to'"). Do you or does someone has an idea how I can fix this? Been stuck for days and the deadline of my thesis is coming up fast... Thanks in advance!
Hey, can we fetch details of a user say, followers and following count through an email on twitter instead of the user name or handle?
Hi Ken! 

How do I scrape based on hashtags, is that possible with this module?
Thank you so much! Your tutorial is so helpful!!!
@Ken Jee Thanks..It's a great video.I want to ask is it possible to scrap a hashtag data which tweet by people of particular country?
helped me a lot! thanks
Thant you for this helpfull tutorial. Can you please show us how to scrap tweets of a specific account(user) ? 
because i tried to add a user argument but apperently query_tweets has no argument named user
Thank you for the great tutorial. But I have problems. When I run the code there are some problems with converting JSON and the code does not skip it , it reties and stack at one tweet? Can you help with it
Hey Ken thank you for this very helpful video! Using your code I tried to scrap tweets with '#bitcoin' but only got 13k tweets for a timeframe of 1 year (without a limit defined in the code). It seems very few. What could the problem be there?
How can i scrape and save, say 100 tweets yesterday, and resume scraping beyond the point today?
Hi Ken - i really liked this as it avoids the complication of the API. Can you explain what is happening in line df=pd.DataFrame(t.__dict__ for t in tweets) ? I know you are converting from the tweet objects to a DataFrame but I don't understand the syntax. Thanks . Seamus
Can we get followers and the people we follow by using this. Or is there any other way for it.
@Ken_Jee

Thank you, for this tutorial 

But when I try to scraping a data, 

it's not giving me only a couple of tweets even thou I'm sure the tags I used having more than thousand of tweets, any help?
Also, is Arabic is considered in this model?


Many thanks
Hi Ken, this video help me a lot, but there's an error that I get said "Traceback (most recent call last) : " and there's a lot of error message down below anyway to fix it?
Hello Ken Jee, would you be able to help? I get this error while running the code below. The error comes out as part of the output. But the number of tweets seems less even without me setting a limit. 
"ERROR: Failed to parse JSON "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" while requesting "https://twitter.com/i/search/timeline?f=tweets&vertical=default&include_available_features=1&include_entities=1&reset_error_state=false&src=typd&max_position=TWEET-1237528655246413824-1237528662397730817&q=coronavirus%20since%3A2020-03-04%20until%3A2020-03-11&l=en"
is it possible to restrict the tweets to location?
Hi Ken, fantastic video, thanks. Instead of saving it as a Panda's df can the tweets be saved as a CSV file?

I'm getting this error. What should I do?
Help needed.. i don't understand this how data is displaying in console area. what have you done after selecting code. please help as i am new to this field. TIA
Hey Ken! I love the video. Just wondering how I can filter by user? when I add user = user into the query, it returns - "query_tweets() got an unexpected keyword argument 'user'" 
Thanks again!
EDIT - I did scroll down here and find the correct code for filtering by username. Is it not possible to add in the date, keywords filters along with a username? For instance, all coronavirus news from nytimes over the last 3 days. Thank you so much again!
Hi Ken, thanks for the tutorial! It really worked. However, after I tried to get a large amount of data (I think the limit I entered was 9999), the console says that it encountered an error involving json file. May I know how could I avoid this error? Thanks!
I have an error that appearance "SSL error"!! 
SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='free-proxy-list.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by SSLError(SSLError("bad handshake: SysCallError(10054, 'WSAECONNRESET')"))   what is the solution for that eeror, help?!!

how if I want to search 'notre dame fire' and '#notre' is that possible?
I have a csv which contains tweet id(s). I need tweets related to the id. Any help is appreciated.

Hey Ken, sorry to bring up an old video. Could you explain or at least direct me to information about cleaning the scraped twitter data?
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied


can I have help with the above error? thank you
Nice video! I wonder what would be the sentiment of the comments here ;p
I have a question - is there a way to get all the comments from tweets from a specific user for a given period, i.e. 2 years? Have been looking for a way to do that, but I'm yet to be experienced :/
Hey! Thanks for the video. I can see from the github page, that I should somehow be able to check which users are verified users with the twitterscraper. But I have just no idea on how I would implement that into your script. Is that something you have tried and know how to do?
Hi Ken,

Thank you so much your video.
I have question to you. If you help me i would behappy. 
Can I make a query like this with this method? 

until:2019-12-01 since:2019-11-29 place:07d9cd6afd884001

Place is including city information. I want collect tweets from here.

Have nice day...
Thank you for sharing! Is it possible to crawl both tweet posts and their replies using Twitterscraper for few years backdated data?
Is it possible to use hours and minutes in addition to the date to get the tweets from a specific period of time? I have been trying to play with it and I am not sure if there is a particular dt.function that needs to be used.
Would you have a method similar to this for scraping facebook data?
Thank you! Awesome tutorial and an amazing find. Btw could you perhaps also do a video on how to get a library of users from twitterscrapper? I tried using the author's example "get_twitter_user_data_parallel.py" but to no avail, kept running into problems :/ Don't know if it is just me though.
thank you for you video, it's helpfull, please i want to get all Trump tweets, when i run the following  :


 import twitterscraper as ts
ts.query.query_tweets_from_user('Danone') 




i get only  the tweets for the last 2 months
THanks for the video! It's brought me closer to my objective than anything else ;-)
But, when I input this line : tweets = query_tweets(#hungergames, begindate = begin_date, enddate = end_date, limit = limit, lang = lang)
it  hangs on ... (this might mean sth in python. New python user here, so I *think* it is asking for more code???)
Or does using a hastag mess things up?
Hi ken, thanks for sharing. When I try to scrap Tweets, I found I only can scrap tweets up to 1 week ago. I tried to set the sartdate as 2015.01.01 and enddate is today, but I can only got Tweets from 2019.10.14 to today. How can I get the old data? Because it seems we can get much more older data using Twitterscraper. Thank you. Looking forward to your reply!
Your video helped me a lot. So, thank you!
Any ideas on how to export the data into csv file anyone?
When I try to save the data as anything other than spyderdata, I get the message "Unable to save current workspace.  Error message:  2019-10-13 (type) to array. 2019-10-13 is my begin date.
what version of Anaconda and Python did you use?
Hi Ken: 
Thanks for the video. 
Is it possible to scrap tweets from one username for a specific time interval?


import twitterscraper as ts
import datetime as dt
tweets = ts.query.query_tweets_from_user('JoeBiden')


# I would like the dates from 6-1-19 to 10-17-19:
begin_date = dt.date(2019,6,1)
end_date = dt.date(2019,10,17)


but query_tweets does not seem to take a username parameter. Can you please provide some assistance? Thank you for your time.
Thank you! I thought I will need an API or something XD
Hi ken i inputted the code you recommended in order to extract the tweets from only donald trump but now I am having a problem with the last command. Below is the code i used:


import twitterscraper as ts
import datetime as dt
import pandas as pd

begin_date = dt.date(2019,9,10) 
end_date = dt.date(2019,9,20)

limit = 1000
lang = 'english'

ts.query.query_tweets_from_user('realDonaldTrump')

df = pd.DataFrame(t.__dict__ for t in tweets)


with regard to the final sentence, when i input it i am getting NameError: name 'tweets' is not defined. how do i define the word tweets? or what code should i use? I am trying to get the nice table where it shows the tweets.
Hey Ken, thank you very much for your helpful video. Maybe you can help me regarding my question: How do I get all tweets from a specific user? Simply implementing the argument 'user' (...lang = lang, user = 'realDonaldTrump') leads to an unexpected keyword argument error. What am I doing wrong here? 

Thanks in advance!
THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!
Hi Ken, thanks for the video. Is there a way to segment the age and the country ?
hi ken,¬† great video!I have a Question.use your code , Try mine.but results have overlapping values
I want to pull protected tweets from a friend, which means I need to login.  Will something like that work with twitterscrapper, or should I just go ahead and beg Twitter for an api key?
Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. 


Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.
This is amazing, thank you for the knowledge! When you're loading into the variable explorer, what are you pressing? Also how are you running the script? I got it to work a few times but it seems to stop working randomly. Thanks again for your help!
hi! great video, thanks for that :) 
I have a problem with reaching the limit - do you know why can it be an issue? I set limit as 1000 and I got only 180 tweets.... (setting bigger limit gives similar results).
how can i get location ?
One more question, if I would like to write the tweets (from this method, with a track word) to a json file how do I access the tweet info?

For example, when I want to print the tweets: 

<twitterscraper.tweet.Tweet object at 0x10b0d8240>

I get something like this, which I understand but I'm not sure how to retrieve the actual information from it. Looking at API documentation, the tweet object should have attributes like 'text' and 'id' and so on. But when I try tweets['text'] I get an error instead. DO you know how I could write it into a file? (also by not using pandas as there is an issue with that library on my end currently which I haven't been able to fix unfortunately)
Hi Ken, 
thanks for this great video. I am currently looking into scraping data from different accounts (e.g. @Danone). How can I scrape all tweets from a specific account?
hi! how would we sample real time tweets? Instead of searching through a track word, can we create a sample if all publicly available tweets at the time by say by language?
Hi! I am using your code to retrieve tweets from specific Twitter accounts...


from twitterscraper import query_tweets
import datetime as dt
import pandas as pd

begin_date = dt.date(2018,12,1)
end_date = dt.date(2019,4,19)

limit = 12600

user = 'AleFerruzcal'

tweets = query_tweets(begindate = begin_date, enddate = end_date, limit=limit, user=user)


BUT I GOT THIS ERROR:

TypeError: query_tweets() got an unexpected keyword argument 'user'


Could you tell me, how should I take in the 'user' filter into your code?
reply me plz
i do same like you did i write code same like your but there nothing in my variable explorer. 2 hours ago courser is rotating
How can i extract data from particular page eg. realDonaldTrump of last 2 months .... with out filtering ?
I'm going give this a try soon.
To be able to see the text clearly, you have to watch the video in HD. The code is below for convenience:


from twitterscraper import query_tweets
import datetime as dt 
import pandas as pd 


begin_date = dt.date(2019,4,15)
end_date = dt.date(2019,4,18)


limit = 1000
lang = 'english'


tweets = query_tweets('notre dame fire', begindate = begin_date, enddate = end_date, limit = limit, lang = lang)
df = pd.DataFrame(t.__dict__ for t in tweets)
I'm in 10th std living in India but I want to go for Data science after 12th std in United States what can I do for it üôèüôè??
Your setup doesn't appear ergonomic sir
A perfect routine. Role model for every data science aspirant out there.
So, this video made me realize how unproductive I am .
Amazing that you wake up so early even in winter! But that‚Äôs probably key to your clear mind.
Are you still doing the data scientist job now with covid going on?
#18: It‚Äôs nice that you did that. I must say, 5 min that represents your 16 daily hours, what a commitment, and what a passion. You really like what your doing!! It‚Äôs inspiring. 
Can I make a suggestion? Take your lunch time and do a little walk after. You will feel different and maybe more (more????) productive je je. You rock üé∏üé∏#66daysofdata
Can A Machine learning Engineer work remotely?
Hi, I have completed masters in Statistics and Learn Data Science. I am curious about job opportunity's in you country. And i want to learn more knowledge from you. Please help me. Hope you replay to this when you see.
Do all data scientists work from home?
Screen goals ftw!
Hey Ken, Which company do you work for? or you work as a full time freelancer?
You are amazing to just listen and watch. And hey I‚Äôm the Office fan as well :)
Great video, thank you for sharing!! May I ask what route you took to becoming a data scientist?? Did you go to school and majored in something relevant or were you a self starter mathematician and learned coding by yourself?? I know it's a loaded question and off topic from the video but some info is very much appreciated!! thank you!!
Hey , great content ! I wonder about the market for data scientist now ? Do you think it's a good idea to go through bootcamps like Springboard ? I want AI focus , is python and R what I should learn ?
Hi Sir, just wanted to ask that if how do I present my interactive charts online. GREAT VIDEO!!!‚ú™ œâ ‚ú™ (*U*)  <3 :{
Thanks for sharing!
What are the wireless headphones your using?
When did you sleep...not mention.???
Great to watch
This was cool to watch! I graduated 4 months ago with a BS in physics (and very little programming experience). I put in a stupid number of hours learning Python, and now I just started a remote part-time DS/DA position with a cycling start-up. Still a lot to learn, but looking forward!
Could you tell me about the jobs. What your employment looks like? Are you a freelancer/self employed, or work for a company remotely?
Man, you blew through your workout that fast? What a beast!üòâ
can you tell me what exactly you did in data science projects and which tyoes of project you pickup and any company required data-scientist then please tell me i am also data scientist 
my github-https://github.com/panditrahulsharma
How do you establish online presence to be in this field? where do you usually get remote jobs in DS?
Hi. I‚Äôm a nurse and planning to shift into data science. Will it be difficult coming from a non-technical background? How much is the starting salary for this profession?
Please can you told me, how do you find your first client
Hey Ken! That was great! what exactly do you do? I want to work remote too!
How much flexible are the working hours? Is it that you have work daily for 6-7 hrs or weekly goals are there?
Can we pursue other career and do the work of data scientist simultaneously ( as a part time ) ?
Lol this video showed more of you not working than actually working. 3 minutes in and you haven't started working yet.
Nice to see how your day goes for this kind of job. Thanks for sharing!
u jost got urself a fellow data science student subscriber !
Dude this is the life I need to live. I am finishing my BS in physics. And a professional career in freeskiing. About to start applying for data science/ analysis here in Salt Lake City. I can‚Äôt wait to start grinding like you! This video serves a great model for me, thank you. I‚Äôm excited to see where my career and this whole data science field will go.
I have a wired question; will learning code, for example python become literally common sense eventually? I‚Äôve seen a lot of data scientists carry laptops with perhaps commands of code to help guide them to applying the code to whatever it is they‚Äôre coding say on their PC. Is that something that is viable for a data scientist working with code?
You got subscriber
For an internship how much do they expect you to know????????
#17: Great advice, but in this, I'm not sure of the best approach. I think the #community is at the Top.
Find someone who believes & gives you the chance ‚≠êÔ∏è#66daysofdata
Sir I am from india . How can I get a data scientist job abroad? Do I need appear in toefl or ielts for that?
Would you be able to make more videos related to data analysis? I've recently subscribed and love your vids, man! However, I'm not looking to become a data scientist per se, but rather, a data analyst. I would love to watch more videos ofyours regarding this topic. I know you have a few already though!
Thank you for sharing all these awesome information!
#16: How complex could by find a StartUp to join? Seems more insightful and interesting to start, before the corporate one, maybe that leads to choosing wisely the path to follow in DS. #66daysofdata
Great video! I was wondering if one don't like management but still like to touch all different types of data science and modeling problem, which will be the better choice?
Well explained! ThankuüòÑ
The vest pun is underrated üëåüëå
Now I have got a clear idea about the difference. The explanation is very specific and well explained.
#15: The chart in the video is super helpful. When I was starting learning about DS all the terms were tangled in my head. A lot to understand and study, for me, it's still tricky were to specialize the knowledge. I do like ML, but AI will be the future! #66daysofdata
Sorry bro, ML is totally different with DS, ML just uses DS to manipulate data but ML and DS are not the same and ML is not a part of DS, ok -_-
Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists. 

Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists.

Thanks... Just wanted to highlight
If youre aiming at becoming a machine learning/ ai engineer.. Do you think that its a good idea to work as a data scientist, without spending much time on machine learning, at first and than specialize on these subjects? i work as a data analyst rigth now (for a short time).
Hey Ken extremely nice video ..got an offer from essex university for msc in applied Data Science and also got a offer from stirling university for msc in Ai and AI with business strategy from Aston University...Just confused which field to choose as a career option?
3:39  I know this video is over 1 1/2 years old but this opinion sounds kinda odd now when you think of what GPT-3 is already capable to do. Especially if you consider it did only basic training till now :D
I‚Äôve been reading quite a few articles to try to figure out the relationship between these terms. Thank you for putting in plain English :)
Your channel is a gold mine for me, keep it up!
What is the relation of deep learning and data science?
And how data science is helping AI in day to day life ?
Don't you think the sentiment for Captain Marvel could've been booster by ad-tweets. Even when removing duplicated, these surely impact a lot. Would there be a way to remove tweets that are advertisements?
Is this compatible with langdetect 1.0.8 version? I'm getting KeyError: 'text' at line 40 where it's filtering for English tweets.
#14: It's interesting how that analysis can lead to some hypothesis. 
I thought Avengers was great and Captain Marvel not so much, but the data, is the data!! #66daysofdata
Interesting. I was wondering how representative this approach is. Querying '#CaptailMarvel' would only pull up a portion of the overall Twitter conversation on the movie, as most casual users don't use hashtags in that way. You're likely looking at a sample of mostly media tweets. Doesn't devalue the analysis of course, great work!
the twitterscraper tool isnt working now any other easy alternatives you suggest other than the official apis
I am using Python for the first time, I tried your code but when running the program there is a ValueError: Cannot take a larger sample than population when 'replace = False'. Which should be edited? Thank you
Can we use geocodes in this as well, I order to know the location of tweets? Kindly reply, it's very important for my project currently üòÖ
Where is the Avenger's video? I totally forgot how to get the comparative graphs for before and after in lines graphs. Please help.
If you aren't interested in the code, feel free to skip to 5:58 for the findings!
#13: Working from home, what a topic. Seems you won the price to giving insight one kind of exact year - March 2019 üòÆ - before the lockdowns started, maybe you see into the future!!! #66daysofdata
I already have a job which ties me to a specific location.  Actually I have 2 jobs. If I wanted a third source of income from data science I would have to work from home in all likelihood.

Hi Ken Jee, can you please suggest some good projects for Data Analysis? And also what is the typical life-cycle for Data Analysis Projects?
Thanks Ken for making such beautiful video. I have started your "Career in Data Science" course on Udemy, and I mist say that it is an amazing course. I have one doubt here, can I start doing projects while I am still learning Python, SQL and maths concepts?
Nicely explained.
Thank you for all the guidelines Ken...
What I learned through this video is to Define your choice, pick tools as per your skills, try to implement different algorithms so it shows be dynamic, most important describe business impact so that I can get opportunities...
#11: Excellent video on how to start, define a project is really tricky, the examples are helpful and the structure to have in mind to develop them is wonderful! #66daysofdata
You're the man Ken! Just started my journey with Data Science and your content is a must for all beginners. Keep up with great work :-)
This is a useful video to introduce newbie like me when we're ready to start our own projects. In fact, and since I've started your"Data science project from scratch" series, it seems like this one, or a remade one (it seems the sound is a bit lower here, mic issues?) , this video or kind or video would be ideal for an episode "zero" of "Data Science project from scratch".
Hi Ken, how about a more detailed video on the different ways to assess the accuracy of the model?
Ken pls upload projects for begineers.
Very useful information. Thank you so much
#10: It‚Äôs kind of odd this video has few views. Very, very good tips for people who try to land a job in DS. The most insightful was the introspection, to land a job it‚Äôs important to do what you like the most. #66daysofdata

I like Kaggle for its competitions and for its kernels which, as you said, are one of the best ways of learning practical data science lessons. 
Also, I love YouTube, even though I do most of my learning from reading not from watching videos. The reason YouTube feels special is that some YouTubers are great at storytelling. They help me have a more personal connection to what I'm learning. üòä

Hi Ken, when you said you were comparing the rolling averages to the  playing minutes in the "previous game" , what does the projection refer to, is it their average across the season?
Hi, How can we install NBASimulator [ Your GitHub repository ] in conda. As we did the installation of nba_api, it got directly installed.
Is this one is different? Also, are there any prerequisites before using jupyter?

Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.

Say today's date is j and yesterdays date is j-1; are you using data through j-1 to predict minutes played on date j and for the RMSE calculation? If not, you will be understating the error. Just wondering because it wasn't clear from just glancing at the code you have in your video.
Hi Ken, my name is Peter. I play a bunch of DFS and I do pretty well, but I have a glaring deficiency and it's my lack of programming / statistics skills. I enjoyed the video on NBA minutes. I think I have some ideas that could make your models even better than they already are, and we could both benefit. My email is PeterTaranovich@Gmail.com. Let me know if you have any interest in collaborating. Regardless, it's a great video and I appreciate you posting it.
A summary of the different data science-related roles from the video:
1. (00:34) Data Analyst/Visualization Specialist: tells the story to stakeholders using a lot of visualization tools such as e.g. PowerPoint, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI or Microsoft Excel.
2. (01:44) Data Scientist: requires a lot of programming skills. Focus on a breadth of skill rather than a depth of skill especially when you're just starting. Tools: Python, R and Scala and scikit-learn.
3. (3:30) Machine learning Engineer: builds models and put them into implementation. The role requires a strong technical background in software engineering or computer science. Tools: git, AWS, SageMaker and a good understanding of microservices
4. (4:38) Deep learning specialist: requires a lot of programming skills, math and a strong background in distributed computing.
#6: The roles seem to haven't changed in the last years. Do you know if there is something out there where you answer those expectations and backgrounds to get insight into the more likely role to try?  #66daysofdata
Thank you.
I have a problem with the def game sim its telling me that im missing a ns  argument
This was a really interesting video. I'd love to see more like this.

Yes, keep producing content, people will like it!!! he he
Excellent video, I have some data from another sport and I'm on the EDA, but this gives me great ideas! Thank you!! #66daysofdata
I never thought about simulating games before. Definitely going to give it a try!
Any chance you sell a simulation software like this? Or is there somewhere I could download it? Very interested!
Hey Ken Can I use this model for my work. I‚Äôm thinking of creating something similar for soccer
Great stuff!
Hi Ken
I was wondering where I could find the data for the latest season and before 2014 as well, I love your videos and used the nba_api but it doesn't seem to have a suitable endpoint. If you have any idea that would be so helpful, thanks!
Hi Ken!
Thank you for this video, I just used your code and built my own little model! Using 2020 data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked 9 of the 13 NBA over/unders correctly.
This is a small sample size, but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate. However, I was wondering how I would make it more accurate? Like what new data points I should add to predict the score. I'm very excited about the return of the NBA.
Thanks!
Hi ken, your videos are wonderful. I have been going through a couple of your videos and found them quite informative & relevant. Thanks for sharing your diverse experience here and giving us a head up. Please keep putting new stuff.
Hi  I am new to Python and am trying to set up the data and code in the program. How do i get the data over and start to work on the team stats?
Very good video i like it
Thanks for the video, but why do yo have such a small screenshot of the code?  I‚Äôm watching this on an iPad and my eyesight sucks.  Also, what is the point of having your image in the lower right-hand corner.  Does you image make it easier to comprehend what concepts and ideas your expressing?  All that negative space is distracting from your content, which is interesting e
Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. 

Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. 

For example:

If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.

Do you see my point?

I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?

Thanks again!
Very informative video. Any thoughts how to handle simulation for data that is not normally distributed. I'm thinking of player FGM, for example, that doesn't seem to be normally distributed.

Hey Ken! If someone already has a data scientist job (only a 4 months experience though) would you think they should pursue a Masters in data science just to get the degree - do you think having the degree will help in the long run?
Any good Data Science programs I should look into?
Hi Ken! I have a degree in biochemistry but currently working in BPO industry. I‚Äôm thinking of doing MSc in Data Science and Analytics part time. What do you think? :)

Thank you for this video! I would love your have your insight in something. I‚Äôve got accepted in a M.Sc in international information systems program, and M.Sc in data science. But I don‚Äôt know which one has more opportunities future-wise or if they are similar. Which one would you recommend given its future prospects? Thank you!
Hello Ken, I just have a few questions in mind that I would love for you to answer, 
1. I am currently approaching my third and final year in computer science and as soon as I finish I want to begin a master's program in data science by fall 2022, so when is the most appropriate time to start searching and applying for a program? [I have a feeling that I am late but I don't know where to start!]
2. How do I differentiate between the programs and choose the best available one?
Do you think its worth doing Msc Data Science for me? I have 4.5 yrs of exp in Data Analytics, good at Python, have little experience on deep learning and nlp. Would a masters in data science be of any use?
Hi Ken! I just graduated high school and looking forward for a career in ds. Is it enough to do a bachelors in data science (without further studying masters) or doing bachelors in CSE with a specialisation in Big Data Analytics to land a data scientists job?
Hi Ken. How would you compare business analytics and data science? Do you think I should go back to get a masters in BA if I have a business degree but not the technical field?
what are the best skills required for ds?
Hi Ken! I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in Maths of Finance and Risk Management at the University of Michigan. I know umich is kind of a prestigious school, but I got rejected from UCLA, UC Berkeley, NYU, the Ivies, etc. for undergrad. I want to potentially go to one of these schools for my masters in data science. Do you think its a stretch? Umich is way harder than expected, and my CGPA is 3.4 and my major CGPA is 3.06. I feel like my CGPA is way to low to be aiming for these schools so I was wondering what my target schools should be when applying for masters. (I also do not have much experience coding due to my major) Thank you! :)
hello, I majored in public health and I am completing a masters in public health. I've learned that a major part of public health is finding data and analyzing it using r studio, sas, and python. the people who do that kind of stuff are called epidemiologists. if i wanted an MS in data science, could i go into it without any real data science background?
You think the ranking of the university is important in this area?! (masters in DS)
If you like this you owe me a dollar.
Hey Ken Jee . Thanks for making this video, I recieved a great insight to ms programs. In the near future can you make a video on " review on resume for getting into a good college for ms in data science"
Hello  Ken jee, I have a BA in computer engineering, but it is several weeks that i realized i am interested in data science. I am learning it on udemy. Should i learn master or it will be better to continue online courses ?
hello Ken Jee ,

I am currently doing Mechanical engineering in last semester & this year will be graduated ..My Question is that what are  options for me either  will I have to  do Ms in Data science or will i explore further data science on my own  so to build up skills?
Thanks for the video
Hi Ken I am a undergraduate senior majoring MIS in Korea. Since I dont know anything about the job market in U.S, I really want to ask this question.
 There are some courses that offer online classess. If they give the same masters degree as on campus course, do you think is it possible to get a internship and a job offer after that internship both in U.S?
(for me it would be like taking class in Korea, and go to US for the internship when the course is almost over.)
Thank you for the video!
Computer Science undergrad and a Masters in Data science? Or go for a Masters in Computer Science. I really want to get into a SWE Job or a DATA SCIENTIST. Im at DePaul by the way doing my bachelors on Comp Sci right now and in there Masters program for a 4+1 so its a lot faster. Which one do you think is better then?
It's true that sometimes we don't know where to start but your videos are helpful for that... I am really able to continue my journey from last many days...
Hi Ken! Thanks for the informative video! I am currently pursuing my master degree in Data Science. This is my second semester but I have been disappointed of this program. Since this is a private school, the tuition fee is $25,000 per semester but the quality of the classes are I think similar to / lower than data science online bootcamp. Nowadays, I am thinking whether I should quit my degree. Seriously I feel like this is waste of money and time. However, considering the money I have spent so far, it is difficult to quit easily.

Hi Ken! I‚Äôm a recent college grad who majored in math at dartmouth, and have been working as a business intelligence engineer for a retail company‚Äôs e-commerce team. I‚Äôm supposed to start a part-time masters in applied math from johns hopkins in a couple weeks, but am thinking maybe I should do a masters in computer science instead? Thanks, I‚Äôd appreciate your opinion!!
Hello sir can we take data science course in Computer sciemce in masters??
hi Ken, i am looking at MSc in Data Science UT Austin, are you familiar with the program?
Hii Ken Sir , first of all very thankful to you for giving valuable information on DATA SCIENCE.

Sir , I  need a advice from you !
Sir , Currently I'm doing my graduation in mathematics  and i want to make my future in DATA SCIENCE  field . For making my career in this field , should i do any certificate course in DATA SCIENCE or master degree in data science ?

Please recommend me the best way !
THANK YOU
Hi Ken! Love the video. I am currently an undergrad student pursing an Information Science degree at the University of Maryland. I was wondering through my major if I could break into the field of Data Science. My second question is that if I want to progress my career  in Data Science, what would be a good masters degree to compliment my undergrad major. Thank you.
Eastern University in PA has a new online masters in data science and the entire cost of the program is $9,900. By far the cheapest program I have found so far!
Hi Ken Jee, I want a short comment about Tilburg University's,NL, Msc Data Science&Society when you have the time!
Hi Ken, What are the chances of getting into USA, Canada & Germany with low profile for Master's in Data Science. My background is 4yr engineering in Information technology. I am currently in my final year, done 2 virtual internship during pandemic from Microsoft and Deloitte. Have lots of online certification on Python, ML, ANN, CNN, NLP, etc. My profile is 6.0/10 GPA, TOEFL-70, GRE-280. Targeting fall 2021. I am going to apply in UCSD, TAMU, SUNY BUFFALO, Lakehead, RWTH. What are your thoughts on my profile? Is it good enough to get admit? Should I go for it or should I just wait for 1 year and prepare myself more in exploring DS?
Thanks for this video! I recently received my B.S. in Mathematical Analytics and Operations Research, and contemplated grad school due to pandemic job market. I just don't believe it would be wise to invest more money in a Master's degree when I already have taken coursework in data science, have data analyst internship experience, and am taking Coursera courses to improve my technical skillset.
51 year-old going for a one-year MS in Business analytics to break into the field and do a career change - what say you? Yay or nay?
Hi Ken. I hope you see this message
I studied Information and Communication Science here in my Country Nigeria and I want to start a career in Data Science. Apart from udemy, udacity and the likes, can you recommend where I can learn the basics and depth of Data Science.
Thanks
I have a bachelors in biology and masters in health science (I am a PA). Should I brush up on coding and do a masters? Or a boot camp? I work full time but make good money I just don‚Äôt want to have tons of debt
Can we please talk about how he actually replied to everyone?!
I have done bachelor in logistics and supply chain management from India. I feel I need a ms data science to fully adapt and get a job . What u say best way to transition into data science field. I feel I won't get any job related to data science bcoz I don't have previous educational knowledge
Would a BA in math and a minor in data science be good enough for a masters in data science.
I am just finished computer engineering and i am thinking of entering into data science. I want to apply for an online masters degree. What do you think??
Hey Ken - Would you consider a BA in Psych and an  MS in Human-Computer Interaction enough of a formal education to learn on my own and land a job?
Hello Ken! I am in a very fortunate spot where I have the option to attain an accelerated masters degree completely free! It is a 5 year program  Co-Terminal. With that being said I am going to be attending Illinois  ITech and would love to know your thoughts on attaining an accelerated masters in Computer science or Data Science. The pros and cons between the two. I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS. I am intrigued in both computer science and data science but I lean towards mastering in data because I feel like a bachelors in CS is already enough. But some people have said that a masters in CS is viewed as more valuable, respectable and versatile. Anyways your expert opinion would be great !please
I'm a civil engineer with SQL and Python experience. I'm thinking of getting a Masters in Data Science to transition fully into the data science field. Any advice? I have the math foundation as we had to take up to non linear differential equations for the math minor. I'm looking at WGU.
im currently doing my bachelors in an electronics major (gonna graduate next year) and wanna go for a ms in data science. do you recommend getting some work exp before that? i don't have any industry exposure, my internships were in the data science field but research-oriented.
Hey I am planning to do my Masters from Canada, currently do IT Engineering from India, and I wanna go for a data science course,
I have one internship in data sc, and still  learning data science
But I have seen many of the Canada universities offer courses like:
Data analytics
Data analytics in business
Data Science

Are these good to go for, if you are planning to become a data scientist?
Hey Ken, just wanted to say you make some amazing content.  I was also wandering whether you think I should rather complete another Bachelors degree or  straight onto a Master in Data Science? I've ended up completing my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science and am currently the middle of my research project in Biomechanics.  Although I enjoy the field I feel like my contributions if I stick with it will be limited to academia and find the idea that my articles may rarely ever be looked at quite disheartening. If I return to university I was considering completing a bachelor of actuarial studies not quite the same as data science but quite closely related.
Hi ken, you are making a great content regarding this data science. I saw one of your video of how to study DS in a step by step process and i am currently following it. I recently graduated and i am thinking of doing MS in data science. Can you suggest some good universities for that ?
Hi Ken thanks for the info. How do organizations value certifications from udemy, coursera and datacamp? It seems that they are much less rigorous in assessments than other formal studies through universities. Besides, if there are so many people pursuing the same route, do you think employers would give preference to those who studied data science in top unis ?
Hi Ken! I have a bachelors in chemical engineering and some years of work experience. I‚Äôm interested in making the switch to data science. Do you think a masters might be worth it for someone in my position? Most masters I‚Äôm considering are 30k-60k total.
A lot of the described disadvantages aren't as bad in the UK. Courses are all around ¬£10k (12k dollars) and we're given standardised student loan. Also, once you're accepted into the course, you tend to be allowed to select any module you want, even if there are advertised prerequisites. 
Helpful content nonetheless. I was accepted into three programmes and realised that only one of them had a robust syllabus. Strangely enough, it also happened to be the cheapest one! The cash grab thing is true.
Hello If I do MS in Data science or Data analytics, I will get job in HR analytics or in HR field ?
Hey Ken, I'm a computer science major right now, but my school came out with a 4 + 1 major masters program, where you get a computer science major and data science masters, its just one extra year. Do you think that's more worth it then a boot camp or cert? it's fairly new,  about 30k.
Hi Ken! Thanks for the video. I come from a humanties background and as of now don't exactly know what kind of position I want after a MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics, but I think the skills can be applied to a wide range of sectors and industries and I can explore more during grad school. In a nutshell, I do want to gain these skills and open more doors in the future, do you think this is a less mature/thought-through motivation to pursue such a degree?
Hi Ken, very informative video. Would a general MS in Analytics be equivalent to a MS in Data Science? Or would employers prefer someone with a MS in Predictive Analytics versus someone with a MS in Analytics?
I am studying BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) in India .
I want  to have a ms in data science from a institute. But in our country (India) all institute provide PG diploma in Data Science. Can you guide me in which country and which institute i can get a degree MS in Data Science with a handsome salary of job.
I have a masters in exercise science, but I want to get into data science/machine learning. I am looking at the University of Denver's masters program in data science and they do have courses in machine learning but from what I read in some of their course descriptions they use Java instead of Python or R.  I seem to read that Python and or R are the two main programming languages used in data science. Being that I have no experience in the computer science field should I go for this type of program or should I go for a masters in computer science at my local university which also has courses on advanced algorithms and machine learning?
Would you say a masters in business analytics is worth it?
You seem to be encouraging me. 

Can you guide me ?
I am above 50 years old - I have Master degrees in Business Administration and Statistics . I have also done  programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area. Recently I have acquired knowledge of ML with Python. I wonder why I didnt think about being a data scientist earlier ! Anyway I want to be one one now - almost at the fang end of my career.. I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA. 
I am a very fast learner .
Can anyone help me in getting data scientist or analyst or business analyst job anywhere in the world? I know my age maybe a negative point but then I have vast experience of working in different business area.
Currently deciding on a Business Major, is Business Analytics a good major to later transition into Data Science?
This is just great, 10min of great insights from your experience!!! #66daysofdata
Hello Ken! Great content! How can I contact you? I would like to discuss a little bit about the data scientist career path and your background is kinda similar to mine. I also added you on LinkedIn. 
Thank you!
hello , thanks for your nice video .imy education background fashion designer, I wanna data scientist but I don't know how can I start please advise me.
Really a very informative video, I am a undergrad student in computer science and I would like to have a career in data science. I tried to do some self study online, but I am still confused if I am doing things write or not. I want to where to start and what to start with. I also don't have a good statistics background, but I have a good experience in programming in Python, so please if you can tell about how to start and where to start.
Which type of Msc degree program that accepts student with different background? Could you illustrate this point naming the program and the college?
Awesome content! Thank you so much for taking the time out to post this. My goal is to finish out my undergrad in computer science & get my masters to become a PA then combine the two professions working as a clinician in addition to working in data science in healthcare. I know that this route is completely unorthodox, but I‚Äôm okay with being untraditional lol.  Does this sound like a feasible plan?
This is super worth watching
Can you provide us with some documentation of this project, I would be grateful if you could do that. Thanks.
Thank you for sharing your project presentation and also thank you for the resources. That is a really nice project.  Also watched your march madness latest video, thanks for coming up with new sports analytics videos.
I always think there is a fundamental variable in sports that nobody takes into account. Very, very interesting project Ken!! #66daysofdata
Can you share the code and the raw data, thanks!
@ken Jee can you link the dataset here?
May I know which package did you use for the PCA?
Github Please of all your project's that got you a job
You told me to watch your first video. It was 4 years ago, today! Happy Anniversary, Ken :) I'm only 4 years behind...
Not me who is coming here to see your communication skills in your first video xD
Hi Ken, in this case, ETH High is predicted using other parameters. But, how could it be used to predict the future cases? 
(Because in my understanding, we would still need to predict most of the other inputs used in the model. So, how would the prediction part of this model work?)
This one is an old video but nowadays Crypto-Currency is really good to invest.  

Hey Ken, What are your thoughts about Crypto-Currency at present? Or Which changes will you do if you want to rebuild a similar project?
1st Video :) #66daysofdata ... I do prefer watching you explain!!
A Legend was Born!
Are you able to manage the lag between actual and predicted values?
Hi ken jee
Ken, thanks a lot for your sharing. may I ask how much crypto-currency you have earned using the model?  : )
Thanks for New approach
No benchmark. 60% is low if the price is in a trend.    FOr financial data, deep learning is not very useful, at least at this stage.
The problem with these sort of codes is that you are predicting the past. It just follows the line of the past and can't make predictions for the future. So if you want to loose money, go a head and use this technique.
Hello everyone - Thank you for your comments! Unfortunately, due to some legal paperwork I signed, I am unable to share the repository for this project. I am happy to answer any questions about what tools I used here.
Github code? It was promised 4 months ago
Any updates on this? Is it still better than 50/50 in the bear market?
There is no github ...
What do you think about NARX? Any experience with it?
Dear Ken,
May I know how the input data with Open,High,Low,Close,Volume can be hourly? I think thats should be daily data?
What's your prediction Ken for 2018 or at least the next 3 months. Triple bottom?
Nice. I have some nice models for this doing very well. How did you make out?
Great video! Can you please post the github link? Thank you
Hi Ken

I've been researching about this. Would be really helpful if you could share the code and softwares used. I hope they are open source. Thanks again for the great content.
