As time clicks forward, our current today is becoming exponentially different from your yesterday, making yesterday's choices diametrically different from our todays realities. In my case, I started as an art student, became a fashion designer, who looked at that landscape and chose to be a small business owner, who then saw technology would rule this domain, educated myself in the ways of programming and database design to build my own on-line business, only to realize after 25 years of success that the inventory investment to grow at the rate necessary for success was more than I wanted to commit to, leading to going back to school to get a formal education in Data Science from UC Irvine, which has led to now starting my new career as and Energy Analyst at the California Energy Commission. My advice is to stay connected to today's reality and be open and agile enough to update your best choice for your best future, cause guys I guarantee you its going to change so you might as well enjoy the ride. Bravo Ken for staying connected to your reality! I am looking forward to watching your next chapter.",

When a psychologist tests for intelligence they use the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version 4. This test is administered in person, and ChatGPT couldn't do it because you need to have a physical body to take the test.  If we research the embodied nature of cognition (see Metaphors we Live By - Lakoff) we learn that human cognition separated from the body is impossible - which makes us wonder what we would be measuring with the intelligence of a bot",

AI in healthcare is interesting - I work in mental health and my company works at a national level for suicide prevention and we are rolling out in a couple ways; including for quality assurance of recorded conversations to identify statements that match identifiers (Lyssn). There may be other ways leadership is looking to integrate AI. I just started at a local Intel/Dell AI Workforce program and hope to branch into AI. I live fairly close to Oregon State University and their AI program has a massive investment from NVIDIA founders for a dedicated research building. Really excited to see where this field takes me.
