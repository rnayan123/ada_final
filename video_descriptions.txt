I gave up on my dream of playing professional golf 10 years ago. Recently, I had the opportunity to relive this through my data science and content work. Through this video, I also had the ability to reflect on how Data and AI are transforming golf while keeping the spirit of the game alive.  Special thanks to SAS for making this possible!

Companies have been selling a lie about full time work. They say that they're your "family" then turn around and fire you to show more profitability this quarter. In this video I give my take on how contracting is actually a safer career than the traditional corporate job that we all view as a safety net.

Big news! I know I haven't been as consistent with my YouTube content this past year. That is because I've been in the lab with my friend Jeff Li working to produce the most comprehensive data learning material I've ever made. 

We partnered with 365 Data Science to produce 3 courses. The first on the ml process, the second on ML Algorithms, and the third on real world ML applications and from scratch code examples. 

While these are paid courses, the most important part, the coding examples are all free on github and kaggle.

This past week I had the opportunity to attend #ZendeskRelate with my friends @TinaHuang1 and @Miki_ML! The conference was all about how AI is changing the customer service space. @zendesk announced a partnership wit OpenAI, and they are rolling out a suite of LLM products that directly impact how customers interact with companies. Find out what I learned about AI's takeover of this space. Have you already seen this happening in your interactions with companies? 

If you're interested in learning more, check out these free links from the conference:

I walk through the housing pricing dataset on kaggle in this video. Use the accompanying notebook for best results! I also talk about how I used ChatGPT to help with this analysis. I think it is important to think about how data scientists are integrating new tools as they develop.

I'll never code the same again. After GPT-4 came out, the way I work has fundamentally changed. With this change comes good and bad. The good news is that I'm saving 4-5 hours a week with chat GPT. The bad news is that I may forget how to code all together.

It is hard to become a data scientist, yet it is still possible! There is a lot to learn and it takes a specific mindset to accumulate the skills. 

*Disclaimer: I have created multiple courses with 365 data science. I believe in their product, but also believe other platforms are very suitable for learning the domain. This is not a paid video though. Below is my personal discount code for 365 ds. 

I have no affiliation with kaggle as it is a free platform. I highly recommend that for free learning as well as @freecodecamp!

Today I answer the question: Is data science a good career? I base this off of 5 criteria that I find relevant.

1) Growth of the career - Will there be jobs in the future?
2) The nature of data science work - Will you like the job?
3) Benefits and pay - Will you be compensated fairly?
4) Exit opportunities - What will the career lead to if you want to move on?
5) Secret Sauce (watch to find out)
