This is part 1 of my new series, Data Science Project from Scratch. In this video I go through the planning and idea creation for this new data science project. 

I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. 

The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. 

For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches.

I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. 

In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

Data collection can be a tedious and frustrating process, but you don't necessarily have to start from scratch. You should search github to see if someone has already built a web scraper for the website you are looking at. You should also check to see if the website has an open API. 

For this project, I found someone who had written a glassdoor web scraper and I was able to version it for our purposes. The code and the article that I used are linked here:
Code: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium
Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905

This web scraper was written in python with the selinium package. 

This is an iterative process, so in this video you will see how I go about debugging my code and making it work. 

Stay tuned for part 3 where I go through and clean up the data that we collected to make it usable for our EDA and model building. 

After we scrape the data, I save the code to github.

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.

The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.

I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. 

Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

EDA is where we really start understanding our data. It where we start analyzing trends and begin to find insights. 

First, I do some additional data cleaning. I clean up the job titles, and do some feature engineering. 

Next, I look at histograms and box plots of the continuous data fields. This is an important step because we want normal data if we plan to do a regression analysis. 

We then look at the categorical data. We want to see what companies, states, industries, and sectors these jobs are offered in. 

After that, we make some pivot tables to better understand how average salary is different across our categorical categories. 

Finally, we make a word cloud to visualize some of the most common words found in the descriptions. 

Please stay tuned for part 5 where we start building models to predict salary!

Kaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO This is part 5 of the Data Science Project from Scratch series. In this video I try a few different models to try to predict the glassdoor salary data that we collected in part 2, cleaned in part 3, and explored in part 4 of this series. 

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

When people think about data science, model building is what they usually think about. In this phase, we try multiple different data science algorithms to see which one performs the best. We tune each of these algorithms, and often try multiple at a time to see if we can produce a more accurate result. 

Here, I try a multiple linear regression, a lasso regression, and a random forest regressor. 

I chose to do a lasso regression because the data is fairly sparse, and we would expect a normalized model to perform better. I also selected a random forest because we had many dummy variables. With this type of data, we would also expect a tree based model to perform well. 

Please stay tuned for part 6 where we productionize this model.

In this video I put the salary prediction model that I made in part 5 into production using flask. We make an API endpoint that takes in job posting data and returns an expected salary. 

Article By Chris that we Followed to Create the API: https://towardsdatascience.com/productionize-a-machine-learning-model-with-flask-and-heroku-8201260503d2

github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

For data science projects, model production is not required, but it can separate you from the pack. It shows that you understand how other people could use your model, and you have made it into a product for them. 

I recommend turning a model into an API endpoint or a small web page at least once for your portfolio. 

Stay tuned for part 7 of this series where I make a github readme for this project.
